            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is now near Two Years, ſince I was deſired to employ ſome of my lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Hours in conſidering this Book, and putting it into a Condition of becoming ſomewhat more uſeful and acceptable, than (it may without any ſuſpicion of Vanity be ſaid) the former. Tranſlation could pretend to be. A little Time ſpent in the Peruſal ſatisfy'd me, that there was Matter in it not unworthy my Pains, and ſuch as it was great Pity Men ſhould want the Knowledge of, who underſtand not the Original. And as
<pb facs="tcp:53648:4"/>unreaſonable did it ſeem, that others ſhould be diſcouraged from enquiring into this Author, by the Misfortunes which naturally attend even the beſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of this Nature, when Time, and Improvements of Language have given another Turn to Writing, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Diſreliſh for every thing, which is not ſuitable to the Genius of the preſent Age.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Difficulty which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, was that of finding Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the midſt of thoſe more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Cares of my Profeſſion, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther This, nor any other Attempt or Conſideration, however commendable or beneficial in it ſelf, muſt prevail with me to neglect. But here I found even my Duty aſſiſting; for That requiring part of my Attendance in a Place of ſomewhat more Retirement and Eaſe than where Your Lordſhip's Father was pleaſed to fix me, I made uſe of thoſe Advantages to this purpoſe, and finiſhed much the greateſt part of the following
<pb facs="tcp:53648:4"/>Book, in a way of Diverſion, as it were, and unbending from ſeverer Studies, and a more Laborious Station.</p>
                  <p>The particular Liberty taken by this Author, is a Qualification, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Generation, at leaſt in our Parts of the World, will certainly be fond of. But it happened to have the ſame Effect upon Him ſometimes, which we are not much to wonder if we find very frequent in thoſe of leſs Judgment; and that is, over-ſtraining Points of Diſpute, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to ſay all, which either the Caſe will bear, or which any other Perſon hath ſaid before. This gave Occaſion for my interpoſing ſometimes with an Advertiſement; and that I hope in ſuch a manner, as may not have injur'd the Author, while it deſigns the Benefit and Security of my Reader. One thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I cannot forbear adding upon this Occaſion, that in the midſt of all his Free-Thinking, he conſtantly expreſſes a due and abſolute Deference for Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Divine Truths. And This
<pb facs="tcp:53648:5"/>indeed was by no means the Effect of his Profeſſion, but of his Judgment; for Your Lordſhip is too diſcerning, not to know, that, as a little and ſuperficial Knowledge in Phyſick makes Men Quacks, ſo it is not the Abundance, but the Defect of Reaſon and good Senſe, which makes them Infidels and Scepticks in Religion.</p>
                  <p>How little the Sieur <hi>de Charron</hi> ſuffer'd his Thoughts to be under the Bondage of any private Reſpects, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident to any conſidering Reader, from ſundry Inſtances. Particularly from what he hath deliver'd upon the Subject of Government, in his <hi>Third Book:</hi> In which, tho' ſome Moot Points may ſeem a little uncouth to Us of this Nation, yet if we reflect upon the Conſtitution, under which he liv'd, we ſhall rather have occaſion to wonder at his admitting ſo few reſerv'd Caſes, than mentioning ſo many. Beſides, that even thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd would be of no mighty ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if always confin'd to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:53648:5"/>Conditions, and Occaſions, which He hath temper'd and reſtrain'd them with. But, paſſing from the Myſteries of State, and preſſing unuſual Emergencies, to the Ordinary Meaſures of a Publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, there is ſomewhat of an Air ſo full of Ingenuity, and ſuch regard had to the Great Ends for which Government was inſtituted, as a very gentle Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation would think an Encomium upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, and a ſort of Prophetick Satyr upon the late Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a People to whom he ſtood nearly related.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole Matter (My Lord) I have Reaſon to hope, This may prove not only a Book of Good Entertainment, but Great Benefit, to Perſons who have the Capacity, and will give themſelves the Pains, to conſider it. Were it not ſo, I ſhould not have thought it worth my Trouble; and ſhould yet much leſs have preſumed to make an Offer of it to Your Lordſhip. I can with good Confidence ſay, that no Man is better qualified to be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb facs="tcp:53648:6"/>of the Subject it treats of. The particular and intimate Knowledge of Your Abilities, which my being Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Care of Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at the Univerſity gave me, would bear me out in delivering more upon this Occaſion, than Your Modeſty will permit. And indeed the General Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all that have the Honour of Your Lordſhips Acquaintance, ſaves You that Decency, and hath prevented me in this Point. The Manly Senſe, and Wonderful Penetration, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd very early in You, have given me many pleaſing Reflections; and I am ſure are Foundation ſufficient for making Your Lordſhip a Greater Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Honour to Your Family, than even that Nobility which You have by Deſcent.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt beg leave (My Lord) to put you in mind, that beſides Your Own, Your Lordſhip hath a mighty Stock of Honour and Eſteem to ſet out upon, deriv'd from the Memory of a Father, than
<pb facs="tcp:53648:6"/>whom Few, if Any, of his Condition, are more univerſally loved and admir'd. I ſay, <hi>loved,</hi> my Lord, for This, as a more rare, ſo is it a more valuable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, than that of Honour, to Perſons of Quality, and in Great Offices. For where ſo much is paid to the Station, we can make very little Judgment, what is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and what is the Effect of Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or Fear, or Intereſt. But in His Lordſhip's Caſe there was ſomething ſo Diſtinguiſhing, in all the Reſpects paid to Him, as plainly ſhew'd a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Regard to his Perſon, and that the outward Teſtimonies were not Things of Courſe, but that he had engag'd the very Hearts of Thoſe who paid them.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſo far ſeem to diſtruſt Your Lordſhip's Acceptance of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, as to make the leaſt Apology for it. You will interpret it, I doubt not, as a Teſtimony of the Honour I have for You, and a Deſire to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my having it, to the World: And Your Lordſhip will do me the
<pb facs="tcp:53648:7"/>Juſtice too to believe, that were it in my Power to give any other Evidence of This, than ſuch an open Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nothing ſhould be wanting on my Part, which might prove the Sincerity of thoſe Profeſſions I am Proud to make, of being,</p>

                  <head>OF WISDOM.</head>
                  <head>Three BOOKS.</head>
                  <head>The Author's Preface.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Wherein the Title, the Subject Matter, the Deſign, and the Method of this Treatiſe are explained.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we enter upon the Book it ſelf, it is requiſite the Reader ſhould be well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med what he is to underſtand by that <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is the Name, the Subject, and the End of it; and after what manner it is intended to be treated of in the following Sheets.</p>
                  <p>Now every one at the very firſt hearing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands by <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſome particular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Accompliſhment, whereby a Man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd and ſet above the Vulgar, by a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ability, and more maſterly Readineſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Good or Evil. For tho' there be not the ſame Propriety indeed in the Expreſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:53648:10"/>when converted to the worſe Senſe; yet it is uſed either way, and the Scripture it ſelf makes mention of ſome Perſons <hi>Wiſe to do Evil.</hi> Thus then it does not by any means import a really Good and Commendable Quality of the Mind, but in general any ſort of Knowledge or Skill, exquiſite in the Degree, be the Object and Employment of it what it will. In this Senſe a Tyrant, or a Pyrate, or a Robber, may have this Title apply'd to him; no leſs than a King, or a Pilot, or a Captain; becauſe all we intend by it is only Prudence, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his Profeſſion. Hence it comes to paſs, that Folly is oppoſed to Wiſdom, not only as it denotes Extravagance and Vice, but in general any ſort of Indiſcretion, or meanneſs of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For Wiſdom gives us an Idea of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary and loſty in its kind; as the contrary does of ſomewhat little, and low, and ſhort of the common Pitch. Take Wiſdom in a Good or a Bad Senſe, Two Things are manifeſtly included in it; Firſt, A Sufficiency of Mind, which implies its being furniſhed with all things neceſſary for its purpoſe; and, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Excellency or more than common meaſure of that Proviſion; for to give a Man right to this Denomination, it is no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould enjoy theſe Qualities in a great and eminent degree. Thus you ſee the largeſt and moſt vulgar Notion of Wiſdom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Men commonly tell you; that Wiſe Men are very ſcarce; that they who are ſuch, have a Right to direct and preſide over
<pb facs="tcp:53648:10"/>Others; and, in matters of difficulty, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted like ſo many Oracles; from whence it is very frequently ſaid, that Men take the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Wiſe, and let better Heads deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for them But now, if we come to define the thing more nicely, and fix a right Notion of it, we ſhall not find ſo general an Agreement. For Wiſdom means one thing with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the World, another among Philoſophers, and ſomewhat different from both, in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and Treatiſes of Divines. Theſe Three are the ſeveral Stages and Claſſes of Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all the World is comprehended. The Two laſt have the Advantage, and lead Men by Rules and Precepts, and a ſtrider Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Things: The Firſt looks upon Things but very ſlightly, and take up with very looſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Notions of them.</p>
                  <p>Now it may very truly be ſaid, that there are Three ſorts of Wiſdom, Divine, Humane, and Worldly; theſe relate and bear proportion to God, to Nature in its primitive Purity and Perfection; and to Nature lapſed and deprav'd. Concerning each of theſe ſorts, the Three Orders of Men juſt now inſtanc'd in deliver themſelves, each according to their Condition and Capacity. But more properly and peculiarly thus; The Vulgar are moſt skilled and converſant in the Worldly, the Philoſophers about the Humane, and the Divines about the Divine Wiſdom, as their particular Buſineſs and Study.</p>
                  <p>The Loweſt of theſe is Worldly Wiſdom, and this varies according to the great Ends which it propoſes to it ſelf, Riches, Pleaſure, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb facs="tcp:53648:11"/>With regard to theſe it degenerates into Avarice, Luxury, or Ambition; according to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Diviſion of it,<note place="margin">1 John iii. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>All that is in the World is the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> From whence St. <hi>James</hi> hath given it thoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Characters of <hi>Earthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. iii. 15</note> 
                     <hi>Senſual, Deviliſh.</hi> Now This is what both Philoſophy and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity take upon them to reprove, and endeavour to ſuppreſs and reform. They pronounce it to be no better than Folly and Madneſs, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the ſight of God. And accordingly you will find no mention made of This in the following Treatiſe of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> except it be, to diſallow, and to condemn it.</p>
                  <p>The Divine, and Higheſt of theſe Three ſorts is treated of by Philoſophy and Religion, after a manner ſomewhat different from each other. As for what the Common and Vulgar ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſually ſay, or are capable of ſaying upon this Occaſion, I omit it all, as too mean and low to have any place in our Conſideration, and rather a Profanation of the Subject, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Philoſophers repreſent it as a Matter wholly Speculative, the Knowledge of Firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the Hidden Cauſes of Things; and laſtly, the Higheſt and Supreme Cauſe, GOD Himſelf; which with other abſtracted Notions, is the proper Buſineſs of Metaphyſicks in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. This reſides entirely in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is its chief Happineſs and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; 'tis the firſt and moſt ſublime of all the Intellectual Virtues and Excellencies, which are capable of ſubſiſting without Probity, or Action,
<pb facs="tcp:53648:11"/>or any Moral Virtue. Divines on the contrary do not ſo conſine it to Speculation, as not to extend it to Practice too; for they make it the Knowledge of things pertaining to God, ſuch as ſhould enable us to form a Judgment of Matters to regulate our Lives and actions by: And This they tell you is of Two Sorts; The One <hi>acquired</hi> by Study and Induſtry, not much unlike what I mention'd to be the Science in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Philoſophers; The Other <hi>infuſed,</hi> and <hi>coming from above;</hi> This is the Firſt of thoſe, (which are ſometimes termed the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) Gifts of the Spirit, with regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is ſtyled <hi>The Spirit of wiſdom;</hi> ſuch as reſts only upon the Righteous, and the Pure; and, as the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> truly obſerves,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 1. iv.</note> 
                     <hi>will not enter into a malicious Soul, nor dwell in the Body that is ſubject unto Sin.</hi> This is what the preſent Treatiſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for neither; but is the Subject of my <hi>Firſt Truth</hi> and thoſe other Works of mine, which, are properly <hi>Treatiſes of Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Religious Diſcourſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence my Reader eaſily perceives that Humane Wiſdom is the real Title, and Subject of the following Book; of which it is fit ſome ſhort Deſcription ſhould here be premiſed, which may ſtand for the Argument, or ſummary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole Work. Now, the Common Accounts of this Matter, as they are various and very diſtant from one another, ſo are they all narrow and imperfect. The vulgar and moſt general Notion of it, amounts to no more than Circumſpection, Addreſs, and Prudent Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb facs="tcp:53648:12"/>in Buſineſs and Converſation. This indeed is like the Vulgar and a Thought worthy of Them; who place all Excellence in Action, and Shew, and outward Advantages; and conſider no good Quality any farther, than as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and admir'd. They are entirely devoted to Eyes and Ears; the Internal Motions of the Mind are of little or no Conſequence with this ſort of Men; and therefore, in their Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Matter, Wiſdom may ſubſiſt without either Piety or Pobity; for All they require from it is a good Outſide, and Appearance, and ſuch Eaſineſs of Conduct and Agreeable Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhall approve a Man's Diſcretion and his Parts. Others again miſtake it for a Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Singularity of Temper and Behaviour; a particular Stiffneſs of Faſhion, Obſtinacy in Opinions, Affected Expreſſions, and a Way of Living out of the Common Road. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that value themſelves upon theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they call Philoſophers, when in truth, to return a little of their own Jargon back again upon them, They are nothing better than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Humouriſts, Fantaſtical and Capricious Coxcombs. This now, according to the Scheme and Meaſures purſued in this Book, is, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Extravagance and Folly. The Nature then of this Wiſdom muſt be learn'd from ſome other Hand; that is, from Philoſophers and Divines, who have both explain'd and treated of this Matter in their Moral Tracts. The Former handle it as their proper Buſineſs. For they conſider Men as they are by Nature, and with regard to practice: But the Latter
<pb facs="tcp:53648:12"/>riſe higher, and aſpire to infuſed and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Graces, ſuch as are Speculative and more than Humane; that is, Divine Wiſdome, and with Regard to Faith. Hence it comes to paſs, that the Former is more extenſive and large, as undertaking not only to direct private, but publick Duties, Societies as well as ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are inſtructed by it; Whatever can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or advantagious to Families, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Common Wealths and Kingdoms, all falls within its Compaſs and Juriſdiction. Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the Other Hand is more ſilent and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon theſe Accounts and Aims chiefly, at the Eternal Happineſs and Salvation of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons. Beſides, The Manner and Air of their Treatiſes is very different; That of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy more free, and eaſie, and entertaining; that of Divinity, more plain, and authoritative, and with leſs Pains to recommend it ſelf to Mens Fancies and Palats. Philoſophy therefore, which is the Elder of the Two, as Nature muſt have been antecedent to our Supernatural Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, tries to inſinuate it ſelf and win Men's Favours,

And accordingly there wants a great deal of that Freedom and Gaiety, and (if I may ſo ſay) Cheerfulneſs and good Humour in this, which you are to expect in Philoſophy, which yet muſt be ſo tempered, as not to degenerate into Triſte and Meanneſs, but ſtill continue to be truly Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Brave.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Account, though I do not refuſe, or diſregard the Authorities of Divines, yet I have more frequent recourſe to thoſe of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and Philoſophers in the following Treatiſe. Had I deſign'd to prepare Men for a Cloiſter, or a Life of ſuch Perfection, as aſpires above the Precepts, and aims at the Perfection of Evangelical Counſels, then indeed my Subject would have obliged me to keep cloſe to thoſe Authors: But ſince I am training a Man up for the World, and forming him for Buſineſs and mixt Converſation, Humane and not Divine Wiſdom is the proper Accompliſhment for me to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and the Method of anſwering my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Speaking therefore in general Terms, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the Thing, We muſt, in Agreement with Philoſophers and Divines, acknowledge, that this Humane Wiſdom conſiſts in a Rectitude of the Man, when every part within and without, his Thoughts, and Words and Actions, and every Motion is Graceful, and Noble, and what is for the Honour of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For this is the Excellence of a Man, conſidered as a Man; ſo that, as we call That Piece of Workmanſhip Perfect, which hath all its Parts entire, and is finiſht according to the ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt Rules of Art: He is in like manner ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:53648:14"/>to be a wiſe Man who underſtands upon all Occaſions how to ſhew himſelf a Man, by acting in perfect Conformity to the Fundamental and Firſt Rules of Humane Nature; Or, to ſpeak more Particularly, He that is well acquainted with himſelf in particular, and Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; that preſerves himſelf from all the Vices, the Errors, the Paſſions, the Defects incident to him, as well from the inward Cauſes of his own Mind; as the outward, proceeding from Cuſtom and Common Opinion; that aſſerts the Native Freedom of his Mind, and hath a large univerſal Soul; that conſiders and judges every thing, without enſlaving himſelf to any; that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects all his Aims and Actions ſo as that they ſhall agree with Nature, that is, Pure, uncorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Reaſon, the Primitive Law and Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God, and which ſhines ſtill in every Breaſt; The Model by which the wiſe Man ſquares his own private Judgment. That in his outward Behaviour complies with the Laws, and Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies of the Country where he dwells; that demeans himſelf toward others with Diſcretion and Prudence; is always firm and conſiſtent with himſelf, pleaſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; without any diſcompoſure of Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and entertaining any Accident whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and eſpecially Death, the laſt and moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible of them all. All theſe Strokes or Lines, which go to the making up this Idea, may be reduced to Four, that are the principal and moſt commanding of all the reſt. The Knowledge of a Man's ſelf; Free and Generous Largeneſs of Mind; The acting in Conformity with Nature
<pb facs="tcp:53648:14"/>which is of an Extent ſo large as when right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, to be ſingly and by it ſelf a Rule ſufficient) and true Content and evenneſs of Temper. For theſe are Qualifications which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet, except only in the wiſe Man. He that is defective in any one of them, does not come up to the Character. He that either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes his own Condition, or whoſe Mind is in any ſort of Bondage either to his own Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to the Common Vogue; that is partial, and ty'd up to any particular Notions, cramps up his Thoughts, and cuts himſelf out from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right of examining, and judging every Thing. He that lives in Contradiction to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (that is, Right Reaſon) upon what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever he forſake it; whether he be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Paſſion, or Opinion; He that trips and ſtaggers through Trouble, or Terror, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and lives in dread of Death; This Man is not, cannot be Wiſe. Thus you have in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Piece, which this following Treatiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to draw in its full Proportions. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Second Book, which conſiſts of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules, and a Deſcription of Wiſdom in the groſs; and this indeed is more properly mine, than either of the others; ſo peculiarly ſuch, and ſo full to my purpoſe, that I once had Thoughts of ſending it into the World alone. And what I have here deſcribed in Words, the Graver hath done with his Style, in the Frontis-Piece of this Book, which the Reader will find an Explanation of, immediately after this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53648:15"/>
                  <p> Now there are two Things, which principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce to this Wiſdom, and help Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Attainment of it. The Firſt of Theſe is a Good Conſtitution, or Temperament of the Brain, which makes us capable of ſuch Improvements, as our own Care and Induſtry ſhall be able to acquire. Of how very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence this is, and how far it falls under the Power of Men to contribute to it, you will find at large in the XIII. Chap. of the Firſt, and the XIV. Chap. of the Third Book.</p>
                  <p>The Second is the Study of Philoſophy; not all the Branches of it equally, but the Moral Part chiefly; yet ſo as that the Natural be not wholly neglected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> this is our Candle to enlighten, our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, our Rule to chalk out the Way for us; It explains and gives us true Idea's of the Law of Nature, and by this means furniſhes a Man for every part of his Duty as a Man; whether it concern him in Publick or in Private; in Company or Alone; as a Member of a Family, or of a State; it ſweetens and takes off all the Beaſt in us, makes us tame, and gentle, and good-natured; faſhions and poliſhes this rude Maſs, and forms it into Wiſdom. In ſhort, This is the true Learning; all the reſt a Man is capable of is mere Vanity in compariſon; at leaſt it is in no degree neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and in a much leſs degree uſeful. For here we learn both to Live and to Die well; and this is the whole we have to take Care of: It teaches a generous and noble Integrity, and Honeſt Prudence; and well adviſed Probity; ſuch as raiſe a Man above little Ends, and
<pb facs="tcp:53648:15"/>low Reſpects, and put him upon Virtue from the more exalted and Divine Principles, for the ſake of its own Excellence, and the Senſe that this is what becomes him to do. But alas! This Second Help is almoſt as generally neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as ill uſed as the former. For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the World are ſo entirely taken up with worldly Wiſdom, that they give themſelves little or no trouble about this which I am now mentioning.</p>
                  <p>Thus Nature and Induſtry muſt both do their parts, in order to a Man's obtaining Wiſdom. He who hath been kindly dealt with by Nature, and brings the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Wiſdom with him, in a convenient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Brain, will find good Actions and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners flow very naturally from hence, and feel himſelf advanc'd a great way, without his own Pains: And thoſe Pains need not be very great, where he is not ſo much obliged to conquer, as to promote Nature, and moves with ſpeed and inclination towards the Prize he aims at: But if the Temper on the other hand be amiſs, All will be difficult and ſtrained: Induſtry muſt then correct and ſupply, oppoſe and ſubdue Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as <hi>Socrates</hi> obſerved of himſelf, that by infinite Pains, and laborious Study of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, he had at laſt got the better of a very ill Diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>In proportion to theſe two Helps, there are on the other Hand two Hinderances, or power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countermines, which carry Men into Folly; the one natural, the other acquir'd. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceeds from the Diſtemper of the Brain, whether that be Original or Accidental; by this
<pb facs="tcp:53648:16"/>means it happens ſometimes to be too ſoft, or too moiſt, or the Parts of which it conſiſts are too heavy and groſs; from whence proceed Dulneſs of Apprehenſion, Weakneſs of Judgment, Dark and confuſed Notions of Things, flat, and low, and little Thoughts, ſuch as we generally ſind among the mean and illiterate ſort of People: Or elſe in the other Extreme, It is too hot and dry, which diſpoſes the Perſon to be furious and bold, extravagant and intractable in Vice. Theſe are the two Extremes, like Fire and Water, Mercury and Lead, each of them improper for Wiſdom, which requires a ſtrong and vigorous, but at the ſame time a ſixt and ſteady Mind; and ſuch as in the midſt of all its Gallantry and Firmneſs, may be manageable, and yielding, and modeſt. This Second Deſect however, of the two, ſeems the eaſier to be redreſt; the Firſt is hardly curable.</p>
                  <p>The acquir'd Obſtruction proceeds either from Want of all Inſtruction, or from being Ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; which, among other things, conſiſts very much in ſtrong Prepoſſeſſions, wherewith the Mind was early tinctur'd, and ſo ſinds it ſelf capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to them, not able to get above theſe firſt Impreſſions, nor to think freely and impartially. Such Men we commonly ſay are Headſtrong, and touch'd in the Crown, Whimſical, and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their own Opinions: And, if to that Obſtinacy of Humour, there happen to be added any degree of Learning, This blows them up into Preſumption and Arrogance, puts Weapons into their Hand to defend their Prejudices, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them in Folly, and renders their Diſeaſe
<pb facs="tcp:53648:16"/>incapable of all Remedy. Natural Defects, and Acquired Prepoſſeſſions, are indeed two very formidable Obſtructions; and if Learning do not, as in truth it very ſeldom does, cure them, it adds to the Diſeaſe, and renders them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable. Which yet is by no means any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon Learning, or Diſhonour to it, as ſome may be apt to imagine, but rather a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and to its Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Learning is, without all Controverſie, a moſt excellent Weapon, but not fit to be truſted in every Hand; and he who knows not how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it, will find more hurt than good from it. For it makes ſick and weak Minds giddy and conceited, perfects and poliſhes Fools, no leſs than it does thoſe of good Capacities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. A weak and injudicious Man knows not how to uſe his Weapon; on the contrary it weakens and over-powers Him: He is oppreſt with it, like a Stomach over-charged with more Meat than it can digeſt, or an Arm that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb'd and born down by a Staff heavier than it can uſe. The ſtrong and ſound Mind, quite contrary, plays with it dexterouſly, ſhews a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly Skill in the uſe of it, turns it to Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage perpetually, forms his Judgment, rectifies his Will, pours in this Oil to make the Lamp of Nature burn ſtronger and brighter; is the wiſer and better for that very thing which makes the other but the more exquiſite and more inſupportable Fool. But, all this while, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not accountable for thoſe ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, any more than Wine is guilty of all the Exceſſes committed by it, or a good Medicine
<pb facs="tcp:53648:17"/>ill apply'd, for the Patient's growing worſe upon it. Now againſt theſe conceited half-witted Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, whom Nature hath diſpoſed to Folly, and their own Acquiſitions have perfected in it, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce formal War in my Book, as looking upon them to be irreconcilable Enemies to Wiſdom; and the ſitteſt Title I can find to diſtinguiſh them by, is that of <hi>Pedants;</hi> for which I have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſeveral good Writers, who have uſed the Word in this Signification. It is confeſt, that in its Original Language and proper Senſe, it is taken in a very good and commendable Meaning; but in latter Times, and other Languages, the great Abuſe and Corruption of Learning hath given occaſion for the fixing a very ill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible one upon it; a vile, ſordid, peeviſh, ſtiff way, that makes no other uſe of Learning, but for Gain and Oſtentation, Arrogance and Preſumption; In ſhort, all That which makes Learning deſpicable and derided, is ſignify'd by it. And ſo this, like <hi>Tyrant, Sophiſter,</hi> and the like, is one of thoſe Words which hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely loſt its firſt Signification, and is now become a Mark of Reproach and Contempt.</p>
                  <p>It is very poſſible ſome Perſons may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at my uſing this Term, imagining that I deſign an Affront to thoſe who make Learning their Buſineſs and Profeſſion. But they, I hope, will be ſatisfy'd with this ingenuous Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I have not the leaſt Intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon any Science or Condition of Men, particularly not the Gown, which I have the honour to wear, and to be one of thoſe who are called <hi>Men of Letters,</hi> my ſelf; my meaning
<pb facs="tcp:53648:17"/>is only to charge a certain Quality of Mind, a ſort of Souls which I have been deſcribing, of mean and low Capacity, but moderately provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Nature, and afterwards depraved by Art and Study; Men prepoſſeſt, and obſtinate, and ſierce in certain Opinions; and theſe are to be found in all Robes, and all Conditions; as in truth there is <hi>a World of Mobb in the Pit and Boxes, as well as in the Upper-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. Vulgum tam chlamydatos quam coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam voco.</hi> Let theſe Objectors but find me another Word as expreſſive of thoſe Qualities, and I will moſt readily conſent to the Exchange. In the mean while, after this Declaration, I think I may juſtly ſay, that whoever ſhall ſtill be peeviſh, and have any reſentment upon this account, does but injure Me, and accuſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 'Tis true, there are other Terms of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Wiſe Man; but not any, I think, ſo extenſive and ſignificant as This. The Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, the Ignorant, and Others, which I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take occaſion to make uſe of; Theſe are oppoſed more directly, like Low to High, Weak to Strong, Common to Scarce, a Servant to his Maſter, Prophane to Sacred: Thus likewiſe Fool is ſet the moſt directly in oppoſition to Him; but then This is, as Crooked is oppoſed to Streight, Vain-glorious to Modeſt, Conſtraint to Freedom, Sickneſs to Health. But now <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> includes all this, and a great deal more, in the Senſe which I apply it to: For it gives us an <hi>Idea</hi> of a Man, not only different from, and contrary to a Wiſe Man, as the reſt of them do, but a Fellow that hath the Impudence
<pb facs="tcp:53648:18"/>to oppoſe and make Head againſt him; that comes armed <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> ſawcily challenges him to Combat, and talks magiſterially and dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. And, becauſe in the midſt of all this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſierce Arrogance, he hath ſome ſort of Miſgivings, and thinks himſelf diſcover'd; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bears an inveterate Spight to this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who checks his Follies; is eternally cenſuring, condemning, running him down; eſteeming and behaving himſelf as the only Perſon who has any Right to that Character of Wiſdom; tho' in reality he infinitely exceed all others in the exquiſiteneſs and troubleſomneſs of his Folly.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given my Reader a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Argument and Deſign of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, it may not be unſeaſonable to premiſe one Word or two concerning the Order and Method obſerved in it. He muſt know then, that it conſiſts of <hi>Three Books.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> directs the Knowledge of a Man's Self, and the Condition of Human Nature in general. This is laid as a neceſſary Preparation to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and largely illuſtrated under Five Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſiderations, each of which is ſubdivided into ſeveral Particulars. The <hi>Second</hi> contains the principal Lines and general Rules of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The <hi>Third</hi> deſcends to particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Circumſtances, branched out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Four Cardinal Virtues, of Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude, and Temperance; and here every Part and Relation of Human Life, hath ſome proviſion made for the Duties it engages us in.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53648:18"/>
                  <p> I add too, that I write and treat my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not after a Pedantick manner, and in ſet Forms, according to the Methods of the Schools; nor with regular Arguments in Mood and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, nor with Pompous Eloquence, nor any other Artifice whatſoever. I am verily perſuaded what <hi>Tully</hi> ſays is moſt true, That <hi>Wiſdom, could ſhe but render her-ſelf viſible to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Eyes, would charm our Souls, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh our Affections, and make every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrangely in Love with her.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Offic. Lib. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>(Quae ſi oculis ipſis cerneretur, mirabiles excitaret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores ſui.)</hi> And therefore ſhe need only diſcover her native Beauties, and is too noble, too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to uſe any of thoſe little modiſh Garbs, to adorn and ſet her off; but this I do too with a Liberty which all, perhaps, will not be well pleaſed with. The Propoſitions and Truths are compact and cloſe, but ofientimes very dry, and ſerved up crude and courſely, like Aphoriſms, Overtures, or ſhort Hints of Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>Some Perſons, I am ſenſible, may be apt to think me too bold with ſome commonly-receiv'd Opinions, and take offence that I pay them no greater Deference. To theſe Perſons, and the Fault they ſind with my free way of expreſſing my Thoughts; I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Wiſdom, when above the common Standard, hath a Right to this Liberty. It is the Privilege and Juriſdiction of a Wiſe Man, to call Matters before him, to examine and try them, to cenſure and condemn vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which indeed, for the moſt part, are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than vulgar Errors. And who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:53648:19"/>to bar this Privilege? Why ſhould he who hath it, decline the Exerciſe of it though he knows at the ſame time that this cannot be done, without incurring the Envy and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a great part of the World?</p>
                  <p>Nay, <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot but think, the juſter ground of Complaint lies on my ſide, and muſt therefore reprove Them for this fooliſh and feminine Niceneſs, as a thing that is infinitely too ſqueamiſh and tender to bear neceſſary Truth, or attain to ſound Wiſdom. The boldeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Truths are moſt becoming a truly great Soul; and a Man who hath at all ſtudy'd the World, will not think any thing ſtrange or ſhocking. For this proceeds from Weakneſs of Judgment only, which ought to be corrected; and a Man muſt harden his mind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom himſelf to conſider patiently, even the oddeſt and moſt uncouth things, in order to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a fair Tryal. There is nothing ſo extravagant, but the Mind of Man you ſee is capable of thinking it; and conſequently nothing ſo extravagant, but that a Man may, and will do very properly and well, to give it the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All the Care to be taken upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, that we be not wanting to our Selves; That while we endure to examine every thing, tho' never ſo generally exploded, yet we yield our Aſſent to nothing, but what is good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, tho' never ſo univerſally commended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. For the Wiſe Man gives inſtances of his Courage and Greatneſs of Soul in both theſe Caſes, whereas theſe nice Perſons betray an Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Weakneſs and Delicacy, and are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defective in them both.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53648:19"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatever I propoſe here, it is only with an Intention to have it conſidered: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to oblige Others to think as I do; I Offer my Thoughts, but I do not Impoſe them. If They differ in Judgment from Me, it breeds no Quarrel; I ſhould injure my ſelf extremely if it did; becauſe this is one of thoſe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities that concur to make up a Pedant. Paſſion is generally an Argument that Reaſon is defective; and He that is diſpoſed to any Opinion upon One of theſe Motives, hath ſeldom any great Mixture of the Other with it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then are theſe Gentlemen Angry? Is it becauſe I am of another Opinion? Let them give me fair Quarter at leaſt, for I am not in any Degree diſpleased with Them for differing from me. Is it for ſaying ſome things not agreeable to their Taſt, and that of the World? Alas, 'Tis for this very Reaſon, that I mention them. I hope at leaſt, there is nothing ſaid without Reaſon for it; if they can reliſh it, and diſcern the Force of that Reaſon, 'tis well: If they have better for the other ſide of the Queſtion, and ſuch as will overthrew mine, I am always ready to hear it; and ſhall be both pleaſed and thankful for better Information. But let them not think to run me down with Numbers and Authority, for Theſe have no weight with me, except in Matters of Religion only; and there Authority ſingle is Argument ſufficient to induce my Belief of things, which my Reaſon cannot comprehend. This is its proper Empire, but out of theſe Territories Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reigns and hath abſolutely Juriſdiction, as
<pb facs="tcp:53648:20"/>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf hath very truly and very ingenuouſly acknowledged. 'Tis a moſt unjuſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation over our Native Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the very Madneſs of Tyranny and Rage, to think to enſlave us to All that either the Ancients have deliver'd, or the Generality of the World entertained: But eſpecially the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince the greater Part of Mankind know neither what they do, nor ſay. None but Fools will ſuffer themſelves to be led by the Noſe at this rate; and for ſuch this Book I confeſs is not calculated; if it ſhould meet with Popular Acceptance, I ſhould ſuſpect it did not anſwer its Character. The Ancient Authors ought indeed to be heard, and conſidered and duly reſpected; but to be captivated by them, is an Exceſs of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they muſt not pretend to. For though a Man ſhould hear all, and pay a Deference to ſome, yet he muſt aſſent and yield up his Mind to none, but Reaſon only. And indeed put the Caſe we might, and would be governed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities; yet I would be glad to know how this is poſſible to be done; or how we ſhall find ſuch an Agreement among them, as ſhall enable us to ſay, Authority is on our ſide. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for Inſtance, pretended to be the greateſt Man that had then appeared in the World; he took upon him to arraign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all that had gone before him; and yet he ſaid and wrote more abſurd things, than all of Them put together had ever thought of. Nay, he is inconſiſtent with himſelf, and many times does not know what he would be at; of which his wild Notions, concerning The Soul of Man,
<pb facs="tcp:53648:20"/>The Eternity of the World, The Generation of Winds and Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are undeniable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And in truth a Man who conſiders the Matter will find, that to have all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſame Opinion would be infinitely more prodigious and amazing, than to find them otherwiſe. For Diverſity of Opinions is as comely and beautiful in the Minds of Men, as Variety is in the Works of Nature. That Wiſe as well Inſpired Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> allows a great Liberty, in theſe Two Rules; <hi>Let every Man be fully perſuaded in his own Mind;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. iii, v.</note> and <hi>Let no Man condemn or deſpiſe others of a different Judgment and Behaviour.</hi> And it is obſervable, that theſe Directions are given in a Matter much nicer and of greater conſequence, than what we now treat of. For they do not concern Actions merely Humane, and External, and civil Compliances, in which I have declar'd, that my Wiſe Man ſhould not take upon him to be ſingular, nor think it any Diminution of his Character, to ſubmit and conform to Cuſtom and Preſcription: But St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rules are of a Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and relate to ſuch Diſtinctions of Meats and Days, as Men thought themſelves bound upon a Principle of Conſcience to make; Whereas all the Hardineſs and Freedom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, is only that which enlarges a Man's Thoughts and private Opinions from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and Reſtraint; and ſuch as no other Perſon is or can be concern'd in, but what a Man is entirely and ſolely accountable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53648:21"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> However, to give all reaſonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction even in this Point too; In regard ſome things might ſeem too crude and hard for the weaker ſort of People, (thoſe of ſtrong and ſound Conſtitutions I am ſenſible will reliſh and digeſt them all very well,) in Tenderneſs and Condeſcenſion to ſuch queaſie Stomachs, I have taken Care, in this Second Edition, to explain, illuſtrate, and ſoften any thing that might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their ſeebler Judgments. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do now preſent you with a Book diligently revis'd, and conſiderably enlarged above what it was before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I beg leave of the Reader, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to paſs a Judgment upon this Work, that he will permit me to fore-warn him of Seven dangerous Miſtakes, which other Perſons by falling into already, have entertained a leſs favourable Opinion of the Former Edition, than I have the Vanity to think it deſerved.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That he would make a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Matter of Fact and Right; and not from what is related as Done, conclude That ought to be Done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make a great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Acting and Judging; and not conclude from any Liberty of Opinion maintain'd by me, that I pretend to vindicate the ſame Liberty in Behaviorr.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he would not look upon all That as Reſolved and Determined, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Favour of, which is only offered to
<pb facs="tcp:53648:21"/>Conſideration, Argued and Diſputed Problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, and in the old Academick Way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That what I relate from, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other People, be not imputed to Me, or paſs for my own Senſe and Judgment of the Thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That what is ſpoken of the Mind and its internal Qualifications, be not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to any Sort or Profeſſion of Men, or extended to outward and Particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Conditions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That what is ſpoken of Humane Opinion, be not applyed to Religion and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That what belongs to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Actions merely Natural and Moral, be not interpreted of Grace and Supernatural Operations.</p>
                  <p>Let my Reader but lay aſide all Prejudice and Paſſion, and take theſe Cautions along with him, and I am well aſſured, his own Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be reſolved by them, the Objections raiſed by himſelf or others againſt this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe abundantly anſwered, and the Deſign I had in it, cleared from all Blame or Suſpicion. But if, after all, he be ſtill diſſatisfied, let him come forth into fair Combat, and attack me openly. For to traduce, and ſnarle and mangle an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Reputation in a Corner, is I confeſs an caſie, but withal a Baſe, and Pedantick Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, unworthy Men of Senſe or Honour. And, ſince this Book makes particular Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Ingenuity, and fair Dealing, I promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:53648:22"/>any generous Adverſary, either to do him the Honour of freely Acknowledging my Miſtakes, and ſubmitting to his better Reaſons; or elſe to examine his Objections, and endeavour to make both Him and the World, ſenſible of their Impertinence and Folly.</p>

                  <p>AT the upper end of the Page, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Title of the Book, you have <hi>Wiſdom</hi> repreſented by a beautiful Woman; She is naked; yet ſo that there is no offence given to the Chaſteſt Eyes, (intimating, that ſhe needs not any Additional Beauties, or the Aſſiſtance of Art to recommend her, but is natural, plain, and ſimple; yet ſo as in the midſt of Nature and Simplicity to have always a ſtrict regard to Modeſty.) Her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is Healthful and Maſculine, Smiling and Cheerful, Strong and Authoritative. Her Body Streight, with her Feet fixed cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, upon a Cube, that denotes Juſtice, and Firmneſs. Her Arms a-croſs, as if ſhe were embracing her ſelf; intimating, that ſhe is happy in, and ſatisfy'd with her ſelf. Upon her Head ſhe wears a Crown of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and Olive, which imports Victory and Peace. The void Space round about her, ſignifies Liberty: She looks in a Glaſs, held by a Hand coming out of a Cloud, at ſome diſtance from her, which preſents her with the Reflection of her own Face; for Wiſdom is employ'd in the Knowledge and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her ſelf. Upon her Right ſide are
<pb facs="tcp:53648:23"/>theſe Words, <hi>I know not;</hi> not thereby to give Countenance to perpetual Doubt and Scepticiſm; but arguing, that ſhe is mature and cautious in Deliberating, ſlow in Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining; not poſitive or peremptory, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving an Ear open for freſh Reaſons, and not aſhamed to confeſs, that the beſt Human Knowledge is ſtill dark and imperfect.

                  <p>Below, on each ſide the Title, are Four little, deformed, wretched, wrinkled Old Women, bound in Chains; the End of which is faſten'd to the Pedeſtal of Wiſdom; who deſpiſes, condemns, and tramples them under her Feet. The Two on the Right ſide of the Title are Paſſion and Opinion; Paſſion hath a meagre and diſcompoſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, intimating Diſorder and Fury. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion hath wild ſtaring Eyes, an unſettled and ſturdy Face: She is ſupported by ſeveral Perſons, denoting the Extravagance and general Infection of vulgar Errors, and how fond of, and how ſtiff the common People are in them. The other Two on the Left ſide of the Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption are Superſtition, with an amazed Look, her Hands claſped together like a Slave trembling for Fear; ſhewing the Terrors
<pb facs="tcp:53648:23"/>and Aſtoniſhments of People poſſeſs'd with this Phrenſie of the Mind: And Laſtly, there is Learning, which is a counterfeit, artificial, acquir'd, and Pedantic Virtue; a Slave to Laws, and Cuſtoms, and Forms; with a ſwell'd Face, a haughty arrogant Look, bold ſtaring Eyes; and ſhe reads in a Book, wherein is written, <hi>Yea, Nay;</hi> importing the Vanity and Confidence of Learned Men, their Eternal Diſputes, and the wide Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of their Notions; and yet the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Poſitiveneſs they betray in the midſt of all this Difference and Uncertainty. And Laſtly, The Chains which terminate in the Footſtool of Wiſdom, ſhew that Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Mind, which all theſe Qualities bring Men under, which they who ſtudy Wiſdom labour to get above; and they who attain to it, break thoſe Fetters, and are wholly free from that miſerable Bondage.</p>

                     <hi>PETER CHARRON</hi> was born at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Year 1541. and Baptized in St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Church in the <hi>Clos Brunean.</hi> His Father was one <hi>Theobald Charron,</hi> a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; and his Mother's Name was <hi>Nicole de la Barre.</hi> By Her, <hi>Theobald</hi> had One and Twenty Children; and Four more by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife: So that our Author had no leſs than Four and Twenty Brothers and Siſters; and yet, which is very remarkable, among all this numerous Family, there is not any Male-Iſſue now remaining. The Condition of his Parents was not very plentiful; and their Expence, 'tis plain, was great; but however, in regard they ſaw ſomething in their Son <hi>Peter,</hi> which was very forward and promiſing, and argu'd a more than common Capacity, they took the Hint from Nature's
<pb facs="tcp:53648:24"/>Kindneſs, and put him out to a very good School. After he had made ſufficient progreſs in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> he took care to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf with other Sciences, and Parts of Human Learning, and ſtudy'd Logick, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks, Moral and Natural Philoſophy. From thence he proceeded to the Civil and Canon Law in the Univerſities of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> and <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he commenced Doctor in that Faculty. At his return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he betook himſelf to the Profeſſion of the Law, and was admitted Advocate in the Court of Parliament; Where Buſineſs often call'd him to the Barr, which he always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to be the beſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving School in the World: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he took care to loſe none of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hearings; From whence his Mind took ſo ſtrong a Tincture, that a Man may plainly diſcern the Effects of it in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, by the proper Application of Maxims and Terms of Law. This Courſe he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd ſome Five or Six Years; but foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Preferment this way, if ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at all, was like to come hard and ſlow, (he neither having Relations among the Sollicitors and Proctors of the Court, nor particular Intereſt, nor Spirit little enough to cringe, and flatter, and wriggle himſelf into Buſineſs) he gave over that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and apply'd himſelf cloſe to the ſtudy of Divinity. To this purpoſe he read the Fathers, and eminent Doctors of the Church; and having a Tongue well hung, and a
<pb facs="tcp:53648:25"/>Style free and eaſie, but yet refined and lofty too, above the rate of common Preachers; he made uſe of this Talent, by the Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Parochial Clergy, and that with ſo good Succeſs, that he quickly came into Reputation and Eſteem with the Greateſt and moſt Learned Men of his Time; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Biſhops and greateſt Prelates about the Town, ſeem'd to be in ſome ſort of Strife, which of them ſhould get him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Dioceſs. Particularly my Lord <hi>Arnaud de Pontac,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bazas,</hi> a Prelate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Learning, having heard him preach at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, in the Year 1571. was ſo in love with him, that he took him away from the place of his Birth, and carry'd him to <hi>Xaintes</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and into his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Bazas,</hi> and ſeveral other places in <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eloquence acquired ſo juſt Renown, that he had Proffers made by ſeveral Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, of being the Theological Canon (or Divinity-Lecturer) in their Churches; and of ſeveral other Dignities and Benefices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral noble Preſents made him. In ſhort, he was Theologal at <hi>Bazas, Ars, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoure, Agen, Chaors,</hi> and <hi>Condom</hi> ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Canon and Schoolmaſter in the Church of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and Chanter in the Church of <hi>Condom.</hi> Queen <hi>Margarel,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> was pleaſed to entertain him for her Preacher in Ordinary; and the then King, tho' at that time of the Reform'd Religion, was extremely pleas'd with his Sermons, and
<pb facs="tcp:53648:25"/>frequently did him the Honour to hear them. He was alſo a Retainer to the late Cardinal <hi>d' Armagnac,</hi> Legat to his Holineſs at <hi>Avignon,</hi> who had a great value for him. He did great good by his perſuaſive way of Preaching, and by the Excellencies both of his Life and Doctrine, for Two and Thirty Years together, converted and eſtabliſh'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He never took any Degree or Title in Divinity, but ſatisfy'd himſelf with deſerving and being capable of the Higheſt; and had therefore no other Title or Character but That of <hi>Prieſt</hi> only. He never ſaw <hi>Paris</hi> in Seventeen or Eighteen Years, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to come and end his days there; but being a great lover of Retirement, he had obliged himſelf by Vow to become a <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian;</hi> and was abſolved of it about the end of the Year 1588. He went from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> coming by <hi>Xaintes</hi> and <hi>Angers,</hi> where he made ſeveral learned Sermons, and arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the time the States were conven'd at <hi>Blois.</hi> Then he preſented himſelf to the Prior of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians,</hi> one <hi>John Michel,</hi> a Perſon of great Piety, who ſince dy'd Prior-General of the great <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Monaſtery in <hi>Dauphiné.</hi> To Him he communicated his Intention; but it was not accepted, by reaſon of his Age, which was not leſs than Seven or Eight and Forty. And all the moſt preſſing Intreaties he could uſe were ineffectual; for the Excuſe was ſtill this, That That Order required all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Youth to ſupport its Auſterities.

Thus after having done his utmoſt to fulfil his Vow, and himſelf not being in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree acceſſory to its not taking effect, he was aſſured by <hi>Faber</hi> Dean of the <hi>Sorbon, Tyrius</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Jeſuite, and <hi>Feuardent</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> all very learned and able Divines, that there lay no manner of Obligation upon him from that Vow: But that he might with a very ſafe and good Conſcience, continue in the World as a Secular, and was at large, and at his own Diſpoſal, without any need of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into any other Religious Order. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in the Year 1589. he returned back by <hi>Angers,</hi> where he preached the whole Lent, to the great Admiration and Benefit of the People. From thence he went back again to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he contracted a very intimate Acquaintance and Friendſhip with Monſieur <hi>Michel de Montagne,</hi> Knight of the Order of the <hi>King,</hi> and Author of the Book ſo well known by the Title of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne's Eſſays.</hi> For him Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> had a very great Eſteem, and did from him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all poſſible Teſtimonies of a reciprocal Affection: For, (among other things) Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Montagne</hi> order'd by his laſt Will, that in regard he left no Iſſue-Male of his own, Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> ſhould after his deceaſe, be entituled to bear the Coat of Arms, plain, and as they belong'd to his Noble Family.

                     <hi>Charron</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> from the Year 1589. to that of 1593. he compoſed his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Les Trois Veritez, The Three Truths,</hi> and publiſhed it in 1594. but without his Name to it. This was received with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Learned Men, and they printed it after the <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> Copy two or three times at <hi>Paris,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> under the Sham-Name of <hi>Benedict Valiant, Advocate of the Holy Faith;</hi> becauſe the Third Part of that Book contains a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Faith, in anſwer to a little Tract concerning the Church, written formerly by the Sieur <hi>Pleſſis de Mornay.</hi> The Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Book brought him into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of Monſieur <hi>Antony d' Ebrard de S.

                  <p>While he was at <hi>Caors,</hi> the King was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſummon him to the General Aſſembly of all the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> held the ſame Year 1595. Hither he came in the Quality of a Deputy, and was choſen firſt Secretary to the Aſſembly. As he was in this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, an Invitation was ſent him to preach at St. <hi>Euſtache</hi>'s Church, the moſt populous
<pb facs="tcp:53648:27"/>Pariſh in the whole City of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he did upon <hi>All-Saints-Day</hi> 1595, and two Days after. As alſo the Six Sundays in <hi>Lent</hi> 1596. In 1599 he returned to <hi>Caors,</hi> and in that Year, and 1600. he compoſed Eight Diſcourſes upon <hi>the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper;</hi> as many others <hi>upon the Knowledge and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God,</hi> the <hi>Redemption of the World,</hi> the <hi>Communion of Saints:</hi> And likewiſe his <hi>Books of Wiſdom.</hi> While he was thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying himſelf, and enjoying that Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Caors,</hi> my Lord <hi>John Chemin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> preſented him with the Chanter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his Church, to draw him over into that Dioceſs: But having at the ſame time an Offer from <hi>M. Miron,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angiers,</hi> and being courted by Him, to reſide at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> this was moſt agreeable to his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The making a determinate Reſolution was a Work of Time; for his Affection and Convenience drawing ſeveral Ways, kept the Balance long in ſuſpenſe. <hi>Anjou</hi> he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the ſweeteſt Dwelling, the moſt delightful Retreat that <hi>France</hi> could give him; but that Province being then embroyl'd in Civil Wars, (for <hi>Bretany</hi> was not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and ſo like to make a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Neighbour) <hi>Condom</hi> carry'd the Point. It happen'd too, that the Theologal Chair at <hi>Condom</hi> was juſt then void, and this being tendred him by the ſame Biſhop, he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, and reſolved to ſet up his Staff there. To this purpoſe he bought a Houſe, which he built new, and furniſhed to his own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:53648:27"/>and Convenience; reſolving to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the Eaſe and Diverſion he could, and make the beſt of his growing Years, the Infirmities whereof would be ſoften'd at leaſt by good Humour, and a pretty Dwelling. After he was ſetled at <hi>Condom,</hi> he printed thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Diſcourſes</hi> mention'd juſt now, which were Sixteen in all; and alſo his <hi>Books of Wiſdom</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Year 1601. which gave him a great Reputation, and made his Character generally known: So that Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> began from that time to be reckon'd among the Glories and top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Wits of <hi>France.</hi> Particularly Meſſieur <hi>Claude Dormy,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bologne by the Sea,</hi> and Prior of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>in the Fields</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> wrote him ſeveral Letters upon that occaſion; expreſſing the great Eſteem he had for Him and his Writings, and as a Teſtimony of his Value and Opinion of him, offer'd him the Theologal's Place in his Church. Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> deſirous to ſee <hi>Paris</hi> once more, that ſo he might contract a Perſonal Acquaintance with, and expreſs his Acknowledgments for the Favours of this great Prelate; and at the ſame time, in hope to get an Opportunity of reprinting his Books and Diſcourſes, with the Addition of ſome new Tracts. For indeed the Impreſſion at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> he thought wanted correcting; and upon a Review was not at all to his Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of this Deſign, he arriv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> the Third of <hi>October,</hi> 1603. and in a
<pb facs="tcp:53648:28"/>convenient time afterwards he went to pay his Reſpects to the Biſhop of <hi>Bologne,</hi> who receiv'd him with great Civility and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and repeated his Offer of that Preferment, merely to have him near himſelf, and more within the Eye of the Court. Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> return'd him many Thanks for the Honour he had done him, and the good Intentions he was pleas'd to entertain for his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And with his uſual Freedom, told an Advocate in the Parliament, who was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friend of his, that he could be well pleas'd to accept that Preferment for ſome Years, but that the Moiſture and Coldneſs of the Air, and its Nearneſs to the Sea, did not only make it a Melancholy and Unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Place, but very Unwholſome, and Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and Foggy too. That the Sun was his viſible God, as God was his inviſible Sun; and therefore, ſince he had no Hope of ſeating himſelf at <hi>Bologne</hi> with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Health, he thought it much better not to venture thither at all.</p>
                  <p>During his Stay at <hi>Paris,</hi> he lodg'd at one <hi>Bertand</hi>'s a Bookſeller, that he might be near the Preſs, and correct the new Edition of his Books of Wiſdom, of which he liv'd to ſee but Three or Four Sheets wrought off. For on <hi>Sunday</hi> the Sixteenth of <hi>Novemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1603. going out of his Lodging, about one of the Clock, at the Corner of St. <hi>John Beanvais</hi> Street, he call'd to his Servants and complain'd he found himſelf Ill: And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, while they ran to hold him up he ſell
<pb facs="tcp:53648:28"/>upon his Knees, and with his Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, he expired upon the Spot, without the leaſt Agony or Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Pain. His Diſeaſe was an <hi>Apoplex,</hi> and the Quantity of extravaſated Blood was ſo great, that no Humane Help could have preſerved him. The Body was kept Two Days, but the Phyſicians being well ſatisfied that he was actually dead, and the Blood too which ſettled about his Throat, beginning to mortifie, and grow offenſive, they buried him with great Decency, and a very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attendance, in St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Church, the Eighteenth of the ſame Month; where his Father, Mother, moſt of his Brothers and Siſters, and a great many other Relations were Interred. The Day of his Funeral he had his Face expos'd to view, and his Body dreſt in the Prieſt's Habit, as if he had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Officiate at Maſs. And this was done by a particular Direction of his own; for he had frequently left thoſe Orders in Charge, provided his Death happen'd to be ſuch, as wrought no mighty Change or Deformity in his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>As to his Perſon, He was of a moderate Stature, inclining to Fat; of a ſmiling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and cheerful Humor; a large open Fore-head; ſtreight Noſe, pretty large down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; light blue Eyes; his Complexion Freſh and Ruddy; his Hair and Beard very White, though he had not yet got through his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterick, being about Sixty Two Years and a Half when he died. The Air of his Face
<pb facs="tcp:53648:29"/>was always Gay, without the leaſt Allay of Melancholy; his Mien Graceful; his Voice Strong and Diſtinct; his Expreſſion Maſculine and Bold: His Health Firm and Conſtant; he had no Complaints, either from Age or Indiſpoſitions, till about Three Weaks before his Death. Then indeed he now and then, while he was in Motion, felt a Pain in his Breaſt, and found himſelf oppreſt with Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breath. But this preſently went off again after a little Reſt, and fetching his Breath deep. However he acquainted his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician the eminent Sieur <hi>Marſcot</hi> with his Caſe, who adviſed him by all means to open a Vein; aſſuring him, that all his Illneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from fulneſs of Blood, and, if ſome Courſe were not taken ſpeedily to prevent it, a Suffocation might enſue. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it happen'd; for in all probability, the neglecting this Advice of bleeding quickly, was the very thing that coſt Monſieur <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> his Life.</p>
                  <p>His Books of Wiſdom and Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes were printed off after his Death, by the Particular Care of an Intimate Friend, whom he had charged with the Inſpection of them in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Life-time: And abundant Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was given to the World, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf had in this Impreſſion added, and corrected ſeveral Paſſages. Some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, which not Others only, but Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo thought neceſſary to be changed from that firſt Impreſſion at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in 1601, By theſe Alterations he hath explained
<pb facs="tcp:53648:29"/>his Meaning, ſtrengthened his Arguments, ſoftned many Expreſſions without any Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Alteration of the Senſe. All which was done Principally in Compliance with the World; to obviate the Malice of Some, and condeſcend to the Infirmities of Others. The whole had been peruſed and approved by ſome very good Friends, and Perſons of ſound Judgment; and till They had declar'd themſelves ſatisfied and pleas'd, he could not prevail with himſelf to be ſo. But above all, he ſubmitted his Writings to the Church; and hop'd there was nothing there, that might call for a juſt Cenſure, or Miniſter ground of Offence, either to Religion in general, or to that Communion, of which he was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in particular.</p>
                  <p>As to his peculiar Manner of handling the Subjects he undertook to treat of, whether in Books or Sermons, he was us'd to ſay, that there are Three Ways of expreſſing and communicating a Man's Thoughts, which bear Proportion, and ſeem to be adapted to the Three Several Faculties of the Mind; the <hi>Imagination,</hi> the <hi>Memory,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> One of theſe proceeds upon Rules of Art, runs upon Etymologies and Diſtinctions of Words and Things, Definitions, Diviſions, Subdiviſions, Cauſes, Effects, Accidents, and the like. A Second collects together what other People have thought or ſaid upon the Occaſion, and values it ſelf upon the nicety of quoting Books, and Chapters, and Pages: The Third is free and generous, including
<pb facs="tcp:53648:30"/>and doing in a manner all that both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pretend to, but without any Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing ſo, or enſlaving it ſelf to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of Method, and Rules of Art. The Firſt of Theſe he uſed to ſay was ſit for Schools, and to inſtruct young Beginners: The Second too much in Vogue with Preachers and Orators, who in Effect only tack to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether other Peoples Notions, and thoſe too very often after an affected and impertinent Manner; for having nothing to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they make other People ſpeak for them, though never ſo little to the Purpoſe. In reſpect of this Way he declar'd himſelf of a Judgment directly oppoſite to the generality of the World; That to ſtuff a Diſcourſe with Quotations was an Argument rather of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ignorance, than of Wiſdom. That Men took this Courſe in all likelihood to ſet themſelves and their great Reading off to the World, which after all amounts to no more than a good Memory: And This, if not attended with Judgment, is no ſuch mighty Commendation. That Theſe things are oftentimes brought in at random, and all Adventures; picked up from Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Books, and Indexes, where they find Stuff ready made up to their Hands, and ſo they vend it without more to do. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations indeed have their Uſes and proper Seaſons; they are abſolutely neceſſary in controverted Points, where the Cauſe is to be decided by Authorities; But then they ought to be uſed with Moderation, and in
<pb facs="tcp:53648:30"/>Meaſure; and good Care taken, that they be home to the purpoſe; that Prudence be uſed in the Choice of them; for generally the Fewer and the Weightier, to be ſure the Better they are. For it was his Opinion, that of all the Three Manners of Expreſſing our Thoughts, This was the leaſt valuable.</p>
                  <p>As for the Third, That indeed was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the beſt, and the Perſons who make it their Method, are by much the greateſt and moſt ſignificant Men. Antiquity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were thus far of his ſide; The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Homiliſts</hi> being ſo many Examples of it, in whoſe Writings and Orations you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom, or never, find a Quotation; and in truth the old Authors, of all Sorts and Profeſſions, ſeem to make ſound Reaſon, and good Senſe their Buſineſs. This being the proper, the generous Food for entertaining Men deſirous of Knowledge, and of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Minds; This reliſhes and ſhews more of Judgment, and Underſtanding, which are Nobler, and more Exalted Parts of the Mind, than Memory. Laſtly, This is infinitely the moſt Free and Noble in it ſelf, and more Delightful and Improving to Hearers, Readers, and the Perſon who makes Uſe of it too, than any other Method what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: For by this, Men are rather made Wiſe than Learned; and more accuſtomed to examine and make a Judgment of things. Conſequently the Will is directed, and the Conſcience informed this way, whereas the reſt are good for nothing, but to ſtuff his
<pb facs="tcp:53648:31"/>Memory, and Imagination, with other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Notions, or little trifling Niceties. This Account I thought not improper to trouble the Reader with, becauſe from hence he will gueſs, what he is to expect in this Treatiſe, and ſee withal what kind of Taſt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had in Matters of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>As for what relates to his Temper, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Converſation, and Actions, whether in Publick or Private, I ſhall need to ſay only thus much; That he made it his Conſtant Buſineſs, to render them conformable to thoſe Rules and Maxims contained at large in this Second Book of the following Treatiſe; and was very ſucceſsful, and very accurate in the Undertaking: What Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Church he was of, his <hi>Three Verities</hi> abundantly declare; as do likewiſe his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Diſcourſes, which were printed ſince his Death, and make a convenient Volume by themſelves. How ſtrict and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he was, may appear from this ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; That, though he were poſſeſt of ſeveral Theologal Canonries one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet he would never be prevailed with to reſign any of them, in Favour of any Perſon; nor to name his Succeſſor; for fear of giving Occaſion to the Cenſure, of having upon private Reſpects put in an unqualify'd Man, and One who was not worthy to fill ſuch a Poſt. But he conſtantly gave them up freely and clearly, into the Hands of thoſe Biſhops who had collated him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53648:31"/>
                  <p> The laſt thing I ſhall mention upon this Occaſion is his Laſt Will; which was made and written all with his own Hand in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1602. and after his Deceaſe, regiſtred in the Office at <hi>Condom.</hi> In This he firſt returns moſt humble Thanks to God, for all the Mercies and Benefits which by His Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had enjoyed in his Life-time; begs him moſt earneſtly for his infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Mercies Sake, in the Name of his Well-beloved Son, and our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt; and for His Merits ſhed and multiplied upon all his Members the Elect Saints, to grant him Favour, and full Pardon for all his Offences; to receive him for his own Child; to aſſiſt and conduct him with his Holy Spirit, during his Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in this World, that he might ever remain in a ſound Mind, and the true Love and Service of Him his God; and that at the Hour of Death, he would receive his Soul to himſelf, admit him into the Society and ſweet Repoſe of his Well-beloved ones, and inſpire all his Holy and Elect Saints with a Pious and Charitable Diſpoſition, to pray, and make interceſſion for him.</p>
                  <p>Then proceeding to the Legacies, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths among other things; To the Church of <hi>Condom,</hi> provided his Corps be Interr'd there, Two Hundred <hi>Livres (Tournois)</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition that every Year upon the Day of his Death, High Maſs ſhall be once ſaid in his Behalf, and Abſolution once pronounc'd over his Grave. He gives moreover to the
<pb facs="tcp:53648:32"/>Maintenance of poor Scholars, and young Girls, Two Thouſand Four Hundred Crowns, the yearly Income hereof to be diſtributed for ever, the one Moiety to Three or Four Scholars; the other to Three, Four, or Five young Maidens, at the Diſcretion of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, of which he conſtituted Five: The Maſter of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s School, and Rector of the Jeſuites at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> for the time being; his Heir, and Two of his Friends; the Three Laſt to name ſome other Perſons to ſucceed in this Truſt after their Deceaſe, with This Qualification, that they nominate ſuch only, as are well known and reputed for their Abilities, Honeſty, and Charity. And that any Three of theſe in the Abſence of the reſt, might manage, and diſpoſe things as they ſhould ſee convenient: Likewiſe he gives, and bequeaths to Mrs. <hi>Leonora Montagne,</hi> Wife to the Sieur <hi>de Camin,</hi> Kings Counſel in the Parliament at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> half Siſter to the late Sieur <hi>de Montagne,</hi> the Summ of Five Hundred Crowns. And her Husband, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Camin,</hi> he conſtitutes his ſole Heir; He paying the Charges, and Legacies contained in his Will, amounting in the whole to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Fifteen Thouſand <hi>Livres Tournois,</hi> in the Groſs Summ.</p>
                  <p>What hath been thus lightly touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a ſufficient Evidence how Religious and Conſcientious a Perſon Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> was; that he feared God, led a pious and good Life, was Charitably diſpoſed; a Perſon of Wiſdom and Conduct, Serious and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<pb facs="tcp:53648:32"/>a great Philoſopher, an eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, a famous and powerful Preacher; richly furniſhed and adorned with the moſt excellent Virtues and Graces both Moral and Divine: Such as made him very remarkable and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and deſervedly gave him the Character of a Good Man and a good Chriſtian; ſuch as preſerve a great Honour and Eſteem for his Memory among Perſons of Worth and Virtue, and will continue to do ſo, as long as the World ſhall laſt.</p>

For Man hath this Engagement to ſtudy and know Himſelf, which no other Part of the World hath, that it is Natural to him to <hi>think.</hi> This is the peculiar Character, the very Eſſence of Man, and nothing is ſo near, nothing preſents it ſelf ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to his Thought, as Himſelf. So that Nature here hath plainly taught our Duty, and ſhewed that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53648:34"/>this is the Work ſhe cuts out for every Man. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo eaſie, as for a Man to meditate, and entertain his Thoughts. It is incomparably the moſt frequent, moſt common, moſt natural Practice. <hi>Thought</hi> is the Food, the Support, the Life of the Mind; it muſt needs be ſo indeed, ſince the very<note n="*" place="bottom">Cujus vivere eſt cogitare.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſſence of Mind is Cogitation.</hi> And where, I pray, ſhall this Mind begin? where will you find a more proper Subject for its Exerciſe and Entertainment than its own ſelf? Can there be any more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, any that hath a greater Right to this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation? any that is nearer related, or that more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns it to be well acquainted with? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to ramble abroad and fix upon Foreign Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at the ſame time quite overlook and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ones ſelf, is the greateſt Injuſtice, and the moſt unnatural Neglect that can be. No doubt, every Man's true Buſineſs, and the Thing he is properly call'd to, is the thinking of Himſelf, and being well employ'd to ſee how Matters go at home. Theſe are our Trade and our Concern; the reſt but Entertainment and Diverſion. And thus we ſee it is in every other Creature. Each of theſe takes care of it ſelf, makes the Study of its ſelf the firſt and principal Buſineſs, hath Bounds ſet to its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and employs not it ſelf, nor hath any Aim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſuch a certain Compaſs: And yet thou, O vain Man, who wilt be graſping at the Univerſe, who pretendeſt to Knowledge unlimited, and takeſt upon thee to controul and to judge every thing, art perfectly ignorant of thy own ſelf, and not at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pains to be otherwiſe. Thus whilſt thou labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to render thy ſelf the moſt accompliſh'd Part of the Creation; whilſt thou ſitteſt like a Cenſor upon Nature, and determineſt magiſterially, and with an Air of Wiſdom; Thou, in reality, art the greateſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53648:35"/>Ignorant; Thou, all the while, the only Fool in the whole World: Thou art the emptieſt and moſt wanting, the moſt impotent and moſt wretched; and yet in deſpight of all theſe Mortifications, the proudeſt and moſt conceited, the moſt arrogant and diſdainful Creature upon Earth. Look at home then for ſhame; turn thine Eyes inward, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thy Senſes there. Call back thy wandring Mind, thy Underſtanding and thy Will, which rove and ſpend their Strength unprofitably abroad, and fix them in the Conſideration of themſelves. Thou art Buſie, and yet Negligent; Beggarly, and yet profuſe: For thou loſeſt and waſteſt thy ſelf in things without, and forgetteſt quite what is thy own within. Thus thou art a Thief and a Traytor to thy ſelf: Reſtore then what thou haſt thus falſely ſtolen away; and inſtead of gazing round, and looking always before thee, collect thy ſelf, and confine thy Thoughts at home: Look diligently within thee; ſearch curiouſly there, and know thy ſelf perfectly. Thus our wiſe Maſters have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed.</p>

The former of theſe Misfortunes <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhared as well as others; for he had his blind Side too: That is, he was a Man, and conſequently had the ſame Allay of Infirmity and Miſery with other Men: But here was the difference, that he knew he was <hi>but a Man:</hi> He conſider'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and made no difficulty to acknowledge all the Imperfections of it; and therefore he dealt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and acted wiſely; for he lived, and behaved himſelf as a Man ſhould do.

For thus there are Circumſtances and Accidents in Humane Life too, which like ſtrong Winds, and rapid Torrents, change our uſual Courſe, and carry us beyond our ſelves; and this in ſo ſurprizing a manner, that Vice it ſelf hath ſometimes put Men upon doing very good things: So extremely nice a thing it is, to know Men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Fear, and Shame, and Ambition, and a thouſand other Paſſions, put him upon playing the Part you ſee then acted. To know him throughly, you muſt follow him into his Cloſet, ſee him in the Tireing-Room, and in his every-day Garb. Alaſs! he is oftentimes quite another thing at Home, than what he appears in the Street, at Court, or upon the Exchange; one ſort of Man to Strangers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to his own Family. When he goes out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53648:39"/>of his Houſe, he dreſſes for the Stage, and the Farce begins; you can lay no ſtreſs upon what you ſee of him there. This is not the Man, but the Character he ſets himſelf to maintain: And you will never know any thing of him, till you make a difference between the Perſon of the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian that plays, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and the Perſon repreſented by him.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of a Man's ſelf then is not to be compaſſed by any,<note place="margin">True ones.</note> or all of theſe four ways, nor can we relie upon, or make any ſure Concluſions from them. The only way to arrive at it, is by a true, long, conſtant ſtudy of a Man's ſelf; a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent Examination, ſuch as ſhall obſerve and nicely weigh, not only his Words and Actions, but even his moſt ſecret Thoughts, (and that ſo critically, as to diſcern how they are firſt born, upon what they feed, and by what degrees they grow, the time of their Continuance, the manner and the frequency of their Returns upon him.) In ſhort, no Motion of his Mind muſt eſcape his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; no, not his very Dreams: He muſt view himſelf near, muſt be eternally prying, handling, preſſing, probing, nay pinching himſelf to the quick: For there are many Vices in us, that lurk cloſe, and lie deep; and we know nothing of them becauſe we do not take the pains to ſearch far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ferret them out: As the venomous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent while numm'd with cold, is handled ſafely, and ſtings not till he is warm'd. And further yet, when all this is done, a ſenſe and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of particular Failings, and perſonal Faults, and an endeavour to mend them, will not do the buſineſs; but a Man muſt be convinced of his Weakneſs and Miſery throughout, that every part of him is tainted with it; and from thence he muſt proceed to amend the whole, and make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation equally general.</p>

                     <p>THIS is twofold, and therefore capable of a double Conſideration: For the Firſt and Original Formation was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Work of God's own Hand; and this was Supernatural and Miraculous.

In a word, This was the laſt Touch, the Maſter-piece, the Honour, and Ornament, nay, the Prodigy, and miraculous Production of Nature. Hence it is that God is repreſented to us as entring into Conſultation, and making this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

The Plants are juſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reverſe of all this: Their Head and Root is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Ground; and there they ſpread, and thence they get Improvement.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53648:42"/>nearer to the One, and ſome nearer to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe Extremes. As to the true Cauſe of this upright Figure, it is plain, the Rational Soul cannot be It: For the Crooked, the Lame, the Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ſo many living Inſtances, and undeniable Proofs to the Contrary: Nor can it be the Back-Bone form'd in a direct Line; for Serpents have the ſame: Nor is it ſurely the Exceſs of Natural and Vital Heat above other Creatures; for many other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals equal, and ſome excell us in this Reſpect; tho' I will not deny, but each of theſe may contribute ſomewhat toward it: (And that of the Serpent is the leſs Objection againſt the Form of the Back-Bone; becauſe the Crawling of that Creature upon his Belly, is expreſly declar'd to be a Puniſhment and laſting Reproach, for the Tempter's having aſſum'd this Form in working the Seducement and Ruin of our firſt Parents.) But the very Truth is, Our great and mighty Maker and Maſter thought this the moſt convenient Poſture, and ſuch as beſt agreed with the Dignity and Preeminence of Humane Nature, particularly upon two Accounts,</p>

The firſt ſeven Days are employ'd in bringing the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles to a due Conſiſtency, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Conception, to which ſome have been apt to think <hi>Job</hi> might allude, Chap. X. v. 10. The next ſeven Days are taken up in Concocting, Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and Changing thoſe firſt Elements into Fleſh and Blood; which is as yet an unformed Maſs, but the proper Ground and Matter of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body. In the third Week, the Body in groſs is formed, ſo that after ſome one and twenty Days the three moſt Noble and Uſeful Parts of the Body are faſhion'd; the Liver, the Heart and the Brain; and Theſe lie at length, diſtant from one another in a kind of oval or oblong Figure, and connected, or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53648:43"/>juſt tack'd together by ſome thin looſe Joynings, which are afterwards ſill'd up, and reſemble the Form of an Ant; where you may obſerve Three groſſer and fuller Parts, coupled and held together by Two ſlenderer, that lie betwixt. The fourth Week, which raiſes the Account to very near Thirty Days, the whole Body is perfected, and the Parts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of it diſtinguiſhable; and from thenceforth it ceaſes to be an <hi>Embryo,</hi> as that denotes a rude ſhape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Maſs; and is now in a Condition to receive the Soul; which accordingly loſes no time, but comes and takes Poſſeſſion of its new Dwelling, at or before the Term of Forty Days; that is, at five or ſix Weeks. When this proportion of Time is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd, namely after three Months, the Animated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant uſually begins to move; and much about the fourth Month the Hair and Nails ſet forward. And after the ſame Term three times told; that is, after nine Months, is the uſual time of Maturity, and coming into the World. Theſe may perhaps to ſome ſeem uſeleſs Curioſities, and not altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Treatiſe of this Nature: But I muſt own, that I think, one great Advance towards the true and the beſt Wiſdom, would be to underſtand this part of our ſelves; and ſure Men could not but expreſs a greater and more awful Regard of Almighty God, did they but conſider <hi>whoſe Hands have faſhion'd and finiſh'd them;</hi> who watch'd and brought forward their <hi>Subſtances</hi> when crude and imperfect; wrote their <hi>Members</hi> in his Book; and made them to be what they are, after a fearful and very wonderful Manner.</p>

                        <hi>MAN,</hi> as if deſign'd to be all over Wonder, is a Creature made up of Ingredients vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,<note place="margin">Firſt into Two Parts.</note> nay directly oppoſite to one another: For what can be more ſo, than thoſe two <hi>Conſtituent Parts,</hi> His <hi>Soul</hi> and His <hi>Body?</hi> Look upon him with regard to the former of Theſe, and He is a ſort of inferiour Deity: Turn your Eyes down to the latter, and that Perſon which before you almoſt ador'd, you will now be tempted as much to loath and deſpiſe; For what is Man thus above a Beaſt? What but a Load of Corruption, and a Sink of Ill-Humours? And yet, this wonderful diſparity notwithſtanding, theſe two ſo diſtant Parts are linked together with ſuch amazing Art, and embrace each other ſo cloſe and kindly, that there is at the ſame time eternal Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and yet an inviolable Friendſhip between them. They cannot live together peaceably, and yet they cannot part contentedly: Like a Man, that hath a Wolf by the Ears, and neither knows how to hold him, nor to let him go: So is each of theſe Principal Parts in Man; and each may ſay to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what the Poet did.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But in regard one of theſe Parts admits of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion, by reaſon of a great and manifeſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Faculties and Parts of this Soul of ours;<note place="margin">Then into Three.</note> the One part Noble and Pure, Intellectual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; the Other Mean, and Senſual, and Brutiſh; The beſt and moſt lively Repreſentation of Man, and the ſureſt Method of attaining to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, ſeems to be the making of this firſt Diviſion to conſiſt of Three Branches; and ſaying, That the <hi>Conſtituent</hi> Parts of Man are, the <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> are the two diſtant Extremes, diſtant as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth are from each other; and the <hi>Soul</hi> hath a middle Station between both, like the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion where all the Storms and Meteors are form'd. The <hi>Mind</hi> is the moſt Heroick and exalted Part; the Breath, the Beam, the Image, the Efflux of the Divinity. This in the Man is as the King in the Body Politick; its Tendencies and Motions are to Heaven and Happineſs; and it breaths nothing but what is Pure, and Spiritual, and Divine. The <hi>Fleſh,</hi> quite contrary, is like the Dregs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a vile and ſtupid, rude and Tumultuous Mob, the Sediment and Lees, the Bruitiſh part of Man; and this is perpetually diſpos'd to Evil, and ſunk into Matter. The <hi>Soul,</hi> in its middle State, like Perſons of Quality in a Kingdom, below the Beſt, and above the Worſt, is capable of inclining to Good or to Evil; and accordingly it is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicited on both ſides with great Importunity: The <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> are ever ſtruggling to win it over, and, according to the Side it takes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes either a Spiritual and Virtuous, or a Vicious and Carnal Soul. This is the Seat of all thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Paſſions implanted in us by Nature, which, conſider'd ſimply, and in themſelves, have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53648:45"/>neither Virtue nor Vice in them: Such, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as Love, (that kind of it which we bear to our Friends and Relations) and Fear, ſuch as that of Shame, Compaſſion for Perſons in Diſtreſs, and Deſire of a good Reputation.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This Diſtinction deſerves the rather to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, becauſe it will aſſiſt us very much in the Knowledge of our ſelves, and give Men a true Idea of their Actions, which are otherwiſe apt to be miſunderſtood, by paſſing Judgments upon a ſlight and ſuperficial View, and attributing That to the Mind, which in reality proceeds from the Soul; nay ſometimes from the Fleſh, and miſtaking That for Virtue, which is meerly the effect of Nature, nay the inſtigation of Vice: For it is no breach of Charity to ſay, that a great many noble and brave Actions have been done in Heat and Paſſion, or elſe out of Humour, and Fancy, and natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; not ſo much with a deſign to benefit <hi>Others,</hi> as to pleaſe our <hi>Selves.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE <hi>Body</hi> of Man is built and put together, ſo as to conſiſt of Parts vaſtly numerous, both Within and Without: And of Theſe by far the greater Number, are either Round, or of a Figure not far diſtant from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thoſe Within are of <hi>Two</hi> ſorts: Some diſpers'd all over the Body in large Quantities, and great Numbers; as for Inſtance, The <hi>Bones,</hi> which are the Baſes and Pillars that ſupport this Structure: The <hi>Muſcles,</hi> which are the Inſtruments of Strength and Motion: The <hi>Veins,</hi> which are the Channels for conveying the Blood to the Heart; and the <hi>Arteries,</hi> which like ſo many Pipes, feed them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, by ſending it from the Heart to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Body. The <hi>Nerves,</hi> which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed by Pairs, and are the Inſtruments of Senſe and Motion, by vertue of the Animal Spirits contain'd in, and diffus'd by them. Of Theſe ſome are <hi>ſoft,</hi> which ſerve the Head, and aſſiſt Our Sight, our Hearing, our Taſte, and our Speech: Others are <hi>hard,</hi> and theſe are laid along the <hi>Spina Dorſi,</hi> and ſo inſerted into the Muſcles; The <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> the <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and the <hi>Cartilages.</hi> There are likewiſe the Four Humours, the <hi>Blood; Choler,</hi> which provokes and hinders Obſtructions, throws off the the Excrementitious Parts, and excites Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>Melancholy,</hi> which whets the Appetite, and moderates ſudden Motions: <hi>Phlegm,</hi> which ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the two Humours laſt mention'd, (Yellow and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53648:46"/>Black Choler) and checks inordinate Heats. The <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are a ſort of generous Fumes, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the Natural Heat, and Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and of Theſe there are Three Degrees of Excellency, the Natural, the Vital, and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. The <hi>Fat,</hi> which is the thickeſt and Oylieſt part of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Other Parts are ſingle, and determin'd to ſome particular Place. Now the whole Body may be conveniently enough divided into Four Stories or Apartments, which are in a manner ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Shops or Workhouſes, wherein Nature keeps her Powers and Faculties employ'd. The Firſt and Loweſt of Theſe is that concern'd in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Species. The Second, and next above, is the <hi>Entrails,</hi> the <hi>Bowels,</hi> and <hi>Stomach,</hi> which in Situation enclines ſomewhat to the Left-Side; its Form is round, ſtreighter below than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with two Oriſices, one at the Top, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Nouriſhment; another at the Bottom, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Guts, whoſe Buſineſs 'tis to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and empty it. This Veſſel receives, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, mingles, and concocts the ſeveral ſorts of Nouriſhment taken in at our Mouths; and from thence works off a Whitiſh Juice call'd <hi>Chyle,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Suſtenance and Nutriment of the Body, and afterwards wrought over again more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in the <hi>Meſeraick Veins,</hi> through which it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into the Liver. The <hi>Liver</hi> is hot and moiſt, lying ſomewhat more to the Right-Side. This is the proper Workhouſe of the Blood, the great Source of the Veins, the Seat of the Vegetative Faculty: Here the Chyle drawn off from the Meſeraick Veins is converted into Blood; which is taken into its Cavities by the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and diſcharg'd again by the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> (which iſſues from the Convex part,) and its Branches, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Ducts, like Rivulets or Streams from a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53648:46"/>Fountain. In the Left-Side lies the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which receives the Diſcharge and Excrementitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the <hi>Liver.</hi> Then follow the <hi>Reins</hi> and the <hi>Guts,</hi> which hang altogether in one Link, and, as according to the uſual Proportion, the Stature of a Man is ſeven times as much as the length of a common Foot; ſo the Bowels, when drawn out, are uſually ſeven times the length of a Man. Theſe Two former Apartments, which ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract into One, (though the Offices of them are ſo very different, as to juſtifie the diſtinguiſhing them into Two) are by many Authors reſembl'd to the loweſt Region of the Univerſe; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary one, which is the Seat of Generation and Corruption; and here that which goes by the Name of the <hi>Concupiſcible Soul,</hi> keeps its peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Third Story is compar'd to the Aethereal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and this is ſeparated from the former by the <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> as it is from That ſtill above it by the Throat: Here the <hi>Iraſcible Soul</hi> hath its Dwelling; and Here thoſe parts in the Breaſt lie, which are termed the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> as the <hi>Heart,</hi> whoſe Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much about the Fifth Rib, and its Point a little diverting towards the Left-Pap. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Hot; the common Source of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, by which it diſtributes the Vital Blood there concocted, through the whole Body, and in that Blood the Vital Spirits: And all this by a diſcharge ſo ſenſible and ſtrong, that each Evacuation creates that Motion which we call the <hi>Pulſe.</hi> Here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are the <hi>Lungs,</hi> a ſoft, rare, and ſpongy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſupple and pliable in their Motions, like a pair of Bellows; and thus they become the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Reſpiration: By which the Heart is cool'd with freſh Air, the Blood kept in perpetual Agitation; the Fumes and Excrements that oppreſs it are by this means diſcharg'd, and the Voice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53648:47"/>by the help of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-Pipe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Fourth and Laſt Apartment, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to that higheſt Region, by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence call'd <hi>Heaven,</hi> is the <hi>Head;</hi> and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Brain,</hi> a Subſtance cold and ſpongy, cover'd over, and wrapt up in two Membranes, One hard and thick, which touches the Skull, and is term'd the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> The Other more gentle and thin, contiguous to the former, and known by the Name of <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> From the Brain are deriv'd all the Nerves, and that Marrow which runs all along through the Back-Bone. This Brain is the Seat of the Reaſonable Soul, the Source of Senſe and Motion, and of all thoſe Noble Spirits call'd the <hi>Animal</hi> and extracted from the <hi>Vital</hi> Spirits, which when ſent up through the Arteries into the Brain, are concocted, refin'd, wrought off, and ſubtiliz'd, by means of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall and exceeding fine Arteries, which, like ſo many little Threads plaited and interwoven with each other, make a ſort of Labyrinth, or double Net, (the <hi>Rete Mirabile</hi>) in which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirit being kept, by perpetual Motion back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, is exalted and refin'd, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Animal,</hi> that is, ſublimated and ſpirituous to the laſt and higheſt Degree.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Outward Parts, and ſuch as ſtand in View, are either ſingle or double. If ſingle, they are placed in the midſt, as the <hi>Noſe,</hi> which ſerves us in Breathing and Smelling, and conveys Comfort and Refreſhment to the Brain; as it is alſo uſeful for the diſcharge of any Humours which happen to annoy the Head: And through this Paſſage the Air goes in and out, both for the Service of the Lungs below, and of the Brain above. The <hi>Mouth,</hi> which aſſiſts us in Speaking and Eating; and as the Uſes of it are different, ſo are the Parts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53648:47"/>which qualifie it for thoſe Uſes. Without, there are the <hi>Lips;</hi> Within, you have the <hi>Tongue,</hi> extremely nimble in Motion, and a nice Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Taſts: The <hi>Teeth,</hi> to bruiſe and chew our Meat, and prepare it for the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> If the Parts of the <hi>Head</hi> be double and alike, they are plac'd collaterally, and anſwer exactly to each other: So do the <hi>Eyes,</hi> which, like Centinels or Spies, are poſted at the top of the Houſe, for the gaining a more advantageous Proſpect: Theſe are made up of wonderful variety; each hath Three Humours, Seven Coats, Seven Muſcles, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Colours, and are form'd with infinite Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and inexpreſſible Contrivance. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the nobleſt and moſt admirable Parts of any that appear outwardly in the Body: Their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their Uſefulneſs, the Sprightlineſs of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their ſtrange Attractive Power in creating <hi>Love.</hi> Theſe are to the Face what the Face is to the reſt of the Body; the Life and Air of the Countenance it ſelf: And in regard they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tender, and nice, and valuable, therefore provident Nature hath cover'd and fenc'd them in very carefully on all ſides, with Skins, and Lids, and Brows, and Hair. The <hi>Ears</hi> are near upon the ſame Level with the Eyes; theſe being a ſort of Scouts to the Body, and Porters for the Mind; they receive, report, and diſtinguiſh Sounds, which naturally aſcend upward. The Approaches and Entries of this Organ of Senſe, are intricate and crooked, full of Windings and Turnings, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Air from ruſhing in too quick, and with too great Violence, by which means the Hearing might be extremely impair'd, the Organ wounded and ſtrain'd, and the Sound more confus'd by its exceſſive loudneſs.</p>
                     <p>To all theſe we muſt add the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> by which all manner of Workmanſhip is perform'd;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53648:48"/>and our <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> which like Pillars ſupport this wonderful Edifice, and which, although not of the Trunk and main part of the Body, are yet Inſtruments of ſuch univerſal Uſe, that the Body can very hardly ſubſiſt without them; and it wou'd be very ungrateful not to allow Theſe an honourable Mention in this Account, whoſe Labours make Proviſion for the whole.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53648:49"/>a juſt and proper Temperament of Humours, and fit Diſpoſition of Parts and Veſſels in the firſt Formation of the Body; yet no doubt can be made, but the Nouriſhment and Methods after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards contribute very much to it alſo. The whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of the Milk, and a good ſound Nurſe in the time of Infancy; and a regular way of Living, when Men come to their own Conduct and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; Sobriety and Temperance of all kinds; moderate Exerciſe; Appetites well govern'd, and keeping one's ſelf from Melancholy, and all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion and Diſorder of the Mind, do aſſiſt, preſerve, confirm, and finiſh what Nature and Complexion at firſt begun. <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> are its Oppoſites and Enemies, and theſe are the ſoreſt, perhaps indeed (when all things are rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd) the Only Evils incident to Mankind: Concerning which more will be ſaid hereafter. But both in Enjoying and Preſerving this, the Brutes ſeem to have the better of us; for Man often ruins himſelf, and pays dear for his Frolicks and Exceſſes.</p>

The Power and Efficacy of this Quality is indiſputable; every one ſees and feels it; no other Accompliſhment gains more Eſteem; none is ſo General and ſo Commanding in all the Affairs of Human Life. None are ſo Barbarous, none ſo Stupid or ſo Obſtinate, as not to be ſmitten with it: It ſteps forward, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf to publick View; it beſpeaks our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53648:50"/>prepoſſeſſes our Fancy, ſeduces and bribes our Judgment, makes ſtrong and deep Impreſſions, and is full of Importunity, full of Authority. <hi>Socrates</hi> underſtood its Power full well, when he called it, a <hi>ſhort Tyranny</hi> upon the Mind; and <hi>Plato,</hi> when he term'd it the <hi>Privilege of Nature.</hi> For a Man can hardly forbear thinking, that the Perſons, to whom Nature hath been ſo partial in her Favours, and ſignaliz'd with charming and uncommon Graces, have a ſort of lawful inborn Power over us, and were made to command. Theſe, when they draw our Eyes and Obſervation, do inſenſibly attract our Hearts too, and faſten our Affections upon them, and captivate and enſlave us, whether we will or no. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that Superiority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment belongs to the Comely; that They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Veneration next after the Gods, as being the livelieſt and faireſt Copies of thoſe Glorious Originals; and that all but the Blind muſt, and ought to be affected with their Excellencies.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53648:50"/>be rather called Prettineſſes, and theſe are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Female Sex. In each of Theſe, there is a Subdiviſion; One, which is a fixed and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beauty, and this conſiſts in having the Parts well proportioned, and the Colours juſtly mixed; A Body not ſwelled nor bloated, and yet not ſo thin and meager neither, that the Nerves ſhould ſhew themſelves, or the Bones ſtart out of the Skin; but full of Blood, and Spirits, and well in Fleſh; the Muſcles high and clear; the Skin ſmooth and ſoft; the Complexion freſh and ruddy. The Other is a moveable and inconſtant Beauty, which may be term'd Gracefulneſs; and this conſiſts in a good Air, and becoming Motions; wherein All the parts of the Body are concern'd, but the Eyes more ſo, than any of the reſt. The former is as it were Dead, when not attended with This, for all the Life and Action is in the latter. There are alſo ſome Beauties of a more maſculine, and rough, and fierce Air; and others of a ſofter, ſweet, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and languiſhing Kind.</p>

The lovelieſt Thing in the Perſon of a Man, is, his Soul; and in the Body of a Man, it is his Face; For this is as it were the Abſtract, the Copy and Image of the Soul. It is a piece of Natural Heraldry, where all the Advantages and Coats of Pretence are diſtinctly Quarter'd and Blazon'd; and This, like a Scutcheon, is plac'd upon the Front of the Houſe, that you may know whoſe Seat it is, and who, and of what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Perſon is, that owns and inhabits it. For the Face is an Abridgment of the whole Man; and this ſeems to be the Reaſon, why Art, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follows Nature, and treads in Her Steps, troubles it ſelf little farther in Paintings and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53648:51"/>Carvings, than to give you an exact Repreſentation of the Face from the Life; and leaves the reſt of the Picture or Statue to the Artiſt's own Diſcretion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now there are ſeveral very great Niceties, <note place="margin">Some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Face.</note> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſervable in Humane Faces; ſuch as may very truly be term'd Properties of the Face, ſince neither Brutes, nor any other part of our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, can pretend to the like. And indeed, for want of Theſe, Brutes can ſcarce be truly ſaid to have any Face. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Great Number and Variety of diſtinct Features, and the ſeveral Faſhions of them. For thoſe of Beaſts conſiſt of much fewer; The Cheeks, the Chin, and the Forehead, are There all in one, and not diſtinguiſhed like Ours; nor have they the Figure of ours at all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Wonderful Diverſity of Colours; for in the Eye it ſelf, there is a mixture of Black and White, and Green, and Blue, and Red, and Cryſtalline. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Regular Symmetry of the Parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Proportions anſwer to each other. And this is obſervable in the Organs of Senſe, being double, and exactly correſponding; and in the different Relations, which the reſt bear mutually, in Length and Breadth. Thus the largeneſs of each Eye, meaſuring at the Top of the Socket, gives you the Wideneſs of the Mouth; the Breadth of the Forehead is the ſame with the Length of the Noſe; and that again is of the ſame Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the Lips, and the Chin below. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The wonderful Diverſity of Faces, ſo Nice, ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; that among ſo many Millions of People, there are not two to be found exactly, and all through alike. This is ſuch a Maſter-Piece, as all Nature cannot furniſh ſuch another Inſtance of. And this deſerves a little more particular Attention; becauſe it ſhews the Goodneſs, as well as the Power and Wiſdom of our Adorable Maker, upon the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53648:51"/>Account of the mighty Conſequence and Benefit ſuch Variety is of to Humane Society. Firſt, In regard it ſupplies us with Marks of Diſtinction, ſufficient to know one another aſunder by. For infinite and unconceivable Miſchiefs muſt needs follow, no leſs indeed than utter disbanding and breaking off all Commerce and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Men's Faces were ſo like, as to make us liable perpetually, to miſtake one Perſon for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A Daughter for a Wife, an Enemy for a Friend; and thus a ſecond and worſe <hi>Babel</hi> would follow. Were there no Reſemblance at all indeed, then Men would not be diſtinguiſhed from Brutes; but were there not ſome Unlikelineſs too, than any one Man could not be diſcern'd from any other Man. And, which is yet more wonderful; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath dealt theſe Differences ſo artificially, as to ſatisfie all Parties; and found out a Secret, that thoſe who are moſt unlike ſhould be highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves, and ſhould pleaſe others alſo. For the Matter is ſo order'd, that there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but is approved, and thought very well to paſs, by ſome body or other; and the Faces themſelves do not diſagree more than Peoples Fancies, and their Inclinations to ſeveral ſorts of That which they call Beauty. A <hi>Fifth</hi> Quality peculiar to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faces, is the Dignity and Honour of them, reſulting from the Oval Figure, the Streight Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the Elevation above the Body, their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upwards to Heaven, their naked Graces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Covering of Shag, or Hair, or Feathers, or Scales, as Beaſts and Birds have. A <hi>Sixth</hi> is the Air of the Face, a pleaſant Agreeable Sweetneſs; ſo inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſo engaging, that (as was ſaid before) Hearts are immediately caught, and our Wills and Affections vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently born away with it. In a Word, The Face is the Throne of Beauty and of Love; Seat of Smiles, and of Kiſſes, two things peculiar to Mankind;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53648:52"/>agreable and innocent, when uſed as Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, for true and affectionate Expreſſions of Civility, and Friendſhip, and Kindneſs, and a good Underſtanding between Man and Man, and once a Ceremony uſed in the moſt Solemn, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſemblies. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This is adapted to all manner of Changes in the Temper; it expreſſes all the inward Motions and Paſſions of the Soul. Joy and Grief, Love or Hatred, Envy and Malice, Shame and Anger, Indignation and Jealouſy, and the reſt of them, immediately betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here. This is like the Hand to the Watch, which tells us the Hours and the Minutes, while all the Wheels and Springs, by which thoſe Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made, lie within and out of ſight. And as the Air receives all Colours, and all Alterations of the Weather, and ſo lets us know what Changes are coming: So may it be ſaid of the Countenance too.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MAny probable Reaſons may be given that may induce us to believe the way of going Naked, which is ſtill continued in a conſiderable part of the World, to have been the Original, and once Univerſal Mode of all Mankind, how odd and ſingular ſoever it may ſeem to Us at this Day. The other of Cloathing ſeems the Effect of Art and Invention, contrived to aboliſh Nature upon pretence of mending it; as fantaſtical People ſhut out the Sun, and enlighten their Rooms at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day with Tapers and Candles. And ſurely this is not ſo much the dictate of Neceſſity, as ſome would make us believe. For it is by no means to be imagin'd, that Nature, which hath been ſo Liberal in all her Proviſions for every other Creature, and particularly in Point of warm and convenient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, hath dealt ſo much worſe by Man, than all the reſt, as to leave him the only indigent Child ſhe hath, and in ſuch Need of Help from other Hands, that he muſt ſtarve and periſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, if he be not ſuccoured, and ſupplied with it. This is one of the Reproaches, which fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and melancholy People caſt upon Nature, when they call her a hard and cruel Step-Mother, to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but that Charge againſt her is falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Upon the ſuppoſition, that Men had from the Beginning been all accuſtomed to Cloths, it is not eaſy to conceive how any Number of them ſhould ever take up a Fancy of throwing them aſide again, and going Naked; both becauſe a Regard
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53648:54"/>to their Health, which muſt needs have ſuffered extremely by ſo diſadvantageous an Exchange, and a Regard to Modeſty and Shame too, muſt in all reaſon have perſuaded the Contrary. And yet we ſee, this is ſtill the Faſhion in ſeveral Nations, which is a great Preſumption of its having once been the Faſhion of all Mankind Naturally. For what can be alleged for the Contrary Opinion? Will you urge the Two common Reaſons, that Clothes were always neceſſary to cover our Shame, and to defend us againſt the Cold? (I mention not the Heat, becauſe it is not likely they were taken up for a Protection againſt That) Theſe Arguments are plainly inſufficient. Look back to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive State of our Firſt Anceſtors, and you will find that Nature never taught them to be out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at their Nakedneſs. The Diſtinctions of this Kind are of a later Date; and it was Guilt Firſt, and then Cuſtom, that introduced Shame. Beſides, even thoſe very Parts, which we take Pains to conceal, Nature hath been beforehand with us, in keeping out of Sight. But if we ſhould allow this for one Reaſon of Cloathing, yet the Argument can only concern the Covering of theſe Parts. The Conſequence of it cannot poſſibly extend to the reſt, and thus we ſee in ſome Countries ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Better Condition, do conſult their own and the Beholders Modeſty, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for any farther Garments; though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People in the ſame Places go ſtark naked. Some have thought it a Diſparagement, that Man, who challenges a Precedence and Authority over all Things here below, ſhould not dare to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the World, as God Almighty made him; but though that Thought be liable to ſome Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yet I think truly, it cannot be for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to think himſelf Enrich'd with the Spoils of his Subjects; to be Proud of the Ornaments they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53648:54"/>furniſh him with, and value himſelf, or diſeſteem others, according as he poſſeſſes, or they want theſe poor Advantages, (if they are ſit to be call'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages even in the laſt and loweſt Degree.) And yet this is a Vanity ſo prevailing, that, as if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cou'd not urge enough to make People aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, Religion hath interpos'd her Authority too, to forbid Affectation and Pride in tricking and ſetting off our Perſons, and teaches us, that we ſhou'd never think our ſelves truly adorn'd, except when the virtuous and ſhining Qualities of the Mind render us agreeable and lovely in the Eyes of God and Man. Theſe are the Jewels, theſe the Ornaments which wou'd moſt effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that Shame which all our outward Dreſſes were ſo induſtriouſly contriv'd to cover.</p>
                     <p>As to that other Argument, which proceeds upon Cold, and ſome other things that render Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel neceſſary, either to particular Perſons of a Conſtitution more feeble, or to all that dwell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Climate, ſharper than the reſt; we know full-well, that ſome go naked, and others dreſt, in the very ſame Latitude, and the very ſame Air; and there is never a one of us but expoſes the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Part about him to all Weathers continually: Which gave occaſion to that Reply of a ſturdy Beggar, who when he was asked how he cou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to go naked in the midſt of Froſt and Snow, made only this Anſwer, <hi>That other People cou'd bear their Faces naked, and he was Face all over.</hi> Hiſtory tells us of ſeveral very great Perſons who went conſtantly bare-headed, as <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Severas;</hi> And ſome Nations there are, who being accuſiom'd to no Defence for their Bodies at other times, never trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for any when they go into the Wars, but engage in the hotteſt Action, whole Armies of naked Men together. <hi>Plato</hi> thinks it adviſeable for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53648:55"/>the Health never to cover either the Head or the Feet at all. <hi>Varro</hi> pretends, that when Men were commanded to ſtand bare in the Temple of the Gods, and in the Preſence of the Magiſtrates; it was not only the Reſpectfulneſs of the Ceremony, but the Wholſomneſs of it, that the Law had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to; ſince Men by this means harden'd their Bodies againſt the Injuries of Wind and Weather, and ſtrengthen'd themſelves, while they paid a due Reverence to their Superiours.</p>
                     <p>In a Word, abſtracting from what Revelation hath taught us, and looking at Nature only, I ſhou'd make no doubt but the Contrivances of Hutts and Houſes, and other Shelters againſt the Violence of the Seaſons, and the Aſſaults of Men, was a much more ancient Inſtitution than that of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and there ſeems to have been more of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and univerſal Practice in it; for we ſee that Beaſts and Birds do the ſame thing. The Care and Proviſion of Victuals was unqueſtionably of far greater Antiquity than either of the former, for this ſeems to have been one of the firſt Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Dictates of Nature; the Neceſſities and Appetites whereof return ſo thick upon us, that it is not eaſie to ſuppoſe Man cou'd ſubſiſt at all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Care.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Soul</hi> in general.</head>
                     <p>WE are now entring upon a Subject of all others the moſt difficult and nice; One which has been treated of, and particularly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed by the greateſt Philoſophers, and moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Wits of all Ages and Countries: <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Greek, Arabian,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; but yet ſo that their Opinions have been infinitely various, according to the ſeveral Nations from whence they ſprung, the Religions they embrac'd, the Profeſſions in which they had been educated, and the Reaſons that offer'd themſelves to their Thoughts: So that how far ſoever each Man might ſatisfie his own Mind, yet they have never been able to come to any general good Agreement or certain Determination in the Matter. Now the main Points in Controverſie upon this occaſion, are thoſe <hi>Ten</hi> that follow: What may be the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> of the Soul; What its real <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> Its <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> Whether there be <hi>One</hi> or <hi>More</hi> Souls in a Man; Whence its <hi>Original;</hi> What the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of its entring the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the <hi>Manner</hi> of its <hi>Reſidence;</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> where it dwels; the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> to exerciſe the ſeveral <hi>Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> belonging to it; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> Its <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Body.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of all: It is exceeding hard to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate <hi>Definition</hi> of the Soul, <note place="margin">Its Defin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or be able to ſay exactly <hi>What it is.</hi> And this in truth is the Caſe of all Forms in general; and we cannot well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how it ſhou'd be otherwiſe with Things which are Relative, and have no proper and independent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53648:56"/>Subſiſtence of their own, but are only <hi>Parts</hi> of ſome <hi>Whole.</hi> Hence without queſtion it hath come to paſs, that the Definitions of it put abroad have been ſo many, and at the ſame time ſo infinitely various too, that not any one of them hath been receiv'd without Claſhing or Contradiction. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> hath rejected no leſs than Twelve among the Philoſophers who had written before him; and yet he hath found but little better ſucceſs with That of his own, which he labour'd (but in vain) to eſtabliſh in the room of them.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can indeed be more eaſie and obvious than to determine what the <hi>Soul is not.</hi> We dare be confident that it is <hi>not Fire, Air,</hi> nor <hi>Water,</hi> nor a <hi>Mixture</hi> and due Temperament of the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together, the Qualities or the Humours nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjuſted: For This is a thing in perpetual Flux and Uncertainty; the Animal ſubſiſts and lives without it: And beſides, This is manifeſtly an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi> whereas the <hi>Soul</hi> is a <hi>Subſtance.</hi> To this we may add, that <hi>Minerals,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> have a Temperament of the Four Elements, and prime Tactile Qualities, and ſtill continue Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate notwithſtanding. Nor can the <hi>Soul</hi> be the <hi>Blood;</hi> for ſeveral Inſtances may be given of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and Living Creatures, without any Blood at all belonging to them; and ſeveral Creatures die without loſing one Drop of Blood. Nor is it the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> of Motion in us; for ſeveral Inanimate things impart Motion: So does the Loadſtone to the Iron; the Amber to the Straw; Medicines, and Drugs, and Roots of Trees, when dry'd, and cut to pieces, draw and create very ſtrong Motions. Nor is it the <hi>Act, Life, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy,</hi> or <hi>Perfection,</hi> (for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Term <hi>Eutclechia</hi> hath been interpreted in all theſe diſſering Senſes) For all this cannot be the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf, but only the <hi>Operation</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of it, as <hi>Living, Seeing,</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> are plain and proper Actions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53648:56"/>of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Beſides, admitting this Notion, it wou'd fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from thence, that the <hi>Soul</hi> were not a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but an <hi>Accident</hi> only, that it could not poſſibly ſubſiſt without that Body, whoſe Act and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it is, any more than the Roof of a Houſe can ſubſiſt as ſuch, without the Building which it covers and is ſupported by, or a Relative without its Correlate. In a word, When we expreſs our ſelves after this manner, we only declare what the <hi>Soul</hi> does, and what it is with reſpect to ſomething elſe; but we pronounce nothing of its proper and abſtracted Nature, or what it is in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now, though things are thus far clear and eaſie, yet when we go farther the Caſe alters extremely. A Man may ſay indeed, that the <hi>Soul is an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Life-giving Form,</hi> which diſtributes this Gift as the Receiver is capable of it. To the Plant it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts Vegetation; to the Brute Senſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes and contains Vegetation under it; and to Man Intellectual Life, in which both the former are imply'd, as the Greater Numbers comprehend the Leſs; and as in Figures, a Pentagone includes a Quadrangle, and That again a Triangle. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe to term this the <hi>Intellectual Life</hi> than the <hi>Rational,</hi> (which is compriz'd and underſtood by it, as the Leſs is within the Greater) and that particularly in deference to thoſe many renown'd Philoſophers, who have allow'd <hi>Reaſon</hi> in ſome Senſe, and ſome Degree, even to the Brutes; but not Any of them have ever gone ſo high, as to attribute the <hi>Intelligent Faculty</hi> to Them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take <hi>Intellectual Life</hi> to be a more unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, more diſtinguiſhing Character of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, than the other, which ſome have thought not entirely and peculiarly our own. The <hi>Soul</hi> in the mean while is not the Principle and Original of Life; (This, in my Judgment, is a Term due to none but the Sovereign Author of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53648:57"/>our Being, <hi>the Lord and Giver of Life</hi>) but it is the Internal Cauſe (if you pleaſe) of Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Senſe and Underſtanding: It moves the Body, but is not moved it ſelf; as on the contrary, the Body is moved, but moves not; I ſay it moves the Body, but it moves not it ſelf; for though Self-Motion be in ſome ſenſe a Character by which we expreſs the Freedom of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Will, yet, conſidering the depending State of a Creature, I rather forbear a Term which, in its ſtrict and moſt exalted Senſe, cannot, in my Apprehenſion, belong to any but God himſelf: For whatſoever moves it ſelf thus, muſt be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Eternal; and that Power of moving the Body which the Soul hath, it hath not from it ſelf, but from Above.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The next Enquiry concerns the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Its Nature.</note> (the Humane one I mean; for as to That of Brutes, little doubt is to be made but this is Corporeal and Material, conceiv'd, born, and bred with <hi>Matter,</hi> and corruptible with it too) and this is no ſuch inconſiderable Diſpute as ſome perhaps may imagine; for ſome have affirm'd it to be <hi>Corporeal;</hi> others again contend as vehemently, that it is <hi>Incorporeal:</hi> Which Opinions we will beg the Reader's leave to compare a little, and how wide ſoever they may ſeem, we'll try if it be not poſſible to reconcile them. The Arguments which have perſuaded Men to believe the Soul <hi>Corporeal,</hi> are ſuch as follow. Firſt, The Authority of the moſt Eminent Philoſophers and Divines; and of the latter, no leſs than <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil, Gregory, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> who all admit that the Spirits, both Good and Bad, which are entirely ſeparated from <hi>Matter,</hi> are yet <hi>Corporeal;</hi> and if They be ſo who have nothing to do with <hi>Matter,</hi> how much more probable is this Notion of the Humane Soul, which is in conſtant Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53648:57"/>with, and cloſely united to it? The Ground of their determining theſe things to be Corporeal, is a Notion, that All Creatures of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when compar'd with God, are Groſs, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and Material; and that God Himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is ſo excellent a Subſtance as to be Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real; and therefore every Spirit is Body, and of a Corporeal Nature. To this of <hi>Authority</hi> may be added another Argument, drawn from <hi>Reaſon.</hi> All that is contain'd in this Finite World, muſt needs be Finite it ſelf; limited in Virtue and in Eſſence; circumſcrib'd by ſome Superſicies, conſin'd within ſome place; all which are the true and natural Conditions of a bodily Subſtance. God alone is every where; He alone is Inſinite, and therefore He alone is Incorporeal. The common Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a <hi>Circumſcriptive, Definitive, Effective</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſeem to be meerly verbal, and to carry ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little or no Force at all: For ſtill it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably certain,<note place="margin">See Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.</note> That <hi>Spirits</hi> are in a place after ſuch a manner, that at the ſame time they are there, they are not elſewhere too, nor can be in more places than one at once. They are not in Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Space, nor in extreme Little, nor extremely Large room, but take up ſo much as is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their Size, and equal to their Finite Subſtance. And, did not the Caſe ſtand thus with them, how cou'd Spirits change their Place and Reſidence? how cou'd they Aſcend or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, which yet the Scripture frequently takes notice of their doing? For, if Incorporeal, they muſt be incapable of Motion, Indiviſible, and ſo every where indiſſerently. Since then 'tis evident they change their places, is not this ſufficient to convince us that they are capable of <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> ſubject to <hi>Time,</hi> and the Succeſſions of it, which is requiſite for the adjuſting of Motion, and meaſuring the Paſſages and mutual Diſtances
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53648:58"/>from one place to another? All which are Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to a <hi>Body.</hi> But now, in regard that the generality of People, who ſee not to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of theſe Diſtinctions, by the Word <hi>Corporeal,</hi> form to themſelves an Idea of ſomething Viſible and Palpable, and ſo groſs as muſt affect our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Since they have no Notion of pure and ſubtle Air, nor entertain any Conception of Fire abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Fuel and Flame; ſince, I ſay, they cannot perſuade themſelves that things ſo ſubtiliz'd are Corporeal, hence it hath grown into Uſe, to ſay that <hi>Spirits</hi> in a State of Separation, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls in the Body, are not <hi>Corporeal Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> Nor are they ſo indeed in this groſs and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Senſe; for they are of an Inviſible Subſtance, whether that be <hi>Airy,</hi> as many Philoſophers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have perſuaded themſelves; or whether <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> and yet more refin'd, as ſome <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Authors, who call Heaven and Spirit both by the ſame Name, of an Eſſence proper to Immortality; or whether it conſiſt of a Subſtance ſtill more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and purify'd than even the Aethereal or Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial it ſelf; but ſtill Corporeal nevertheleſs, ſince ſubject to all thoſe Conditions of a Body, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſin'd and circumſcrib'd within a certain Space; capable of Motion, and meaſurable in that Motion, by the ſucceſſive Periods of Time. Again, Were they not <hi>Corporeal,</hi> they muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible; for which way cou'd they ſuffer as we find they do? The <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> manifeſtly receives and is aſſected with Satisfaction and Uneaſineſs, Pleaſure and Pain; and as deeply as ſenſibly touch'd with theſe things in her Turn, as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is from Her Dictates and Her Paſſions. Again, She is likewiſe wrought upon and diſtinguiſh'd by Good and Ill Qualities, Virtues and Vices, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Inclinations of all ſorts; All which are Accidents; and as ſuch require ſome Bodily Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53648:58"/>for their Support and Subſiſtence. Laſtly, All <hi>Souls,</hi> whether ſeparated or united, evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Spirits, as well as Men, are obnoxious to Puniſhment and Torture: From whence it muſt follow, that they are <hi>Corporeal;</hi> For nothing can be in a Condition of enduring Torment, which is not ſo; and ſo the Subject of Accidents is one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Property of a Bodily Subſtance.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now the <hi>Soul</hi> abounds exceedingly in Faculties and Powers, as many almoſt as the <hi>Body</hi> hath Members. <note place="margin">Its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Operations</note> Some of theſe ſhe exerts in Plants; a greater number yet in Beaſts; but vaſtly more in Mankind: Such as the Vital, Locomotive, Appetitive, Attractive, Collective; the Retentive, Concocting, Digeſtive, Nutritive; thoſe of Growing, Sprouting, Hearing, Seeing, Taſting, Smelling, Speaking, Reſpiration, Generation, Cogitation, Reaſoning, Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Aſſenting, Diſſenting, Remembring, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: All which Faculties are by no means parts of the <hi>Soul;</hi> for at that rate we muſt admit the <hi>Soul</hi> to be capable of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and made up of nothing but <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Properties;</hi> but they are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Qualities and Powers of it. Upon theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Actions or Operations of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which muſt needs in order of Nature be after thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that qualifie it for the performance of them. And thus the great <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> whoſe Doctrine in this particular is univerſally aſſented to, obſerves, That in Spiritual Creatures there are Three things to be conſider'd; The <hi>Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Faculty,</hi> and the <hi>Operation.</hi> By the Laſt of theſe, which is the <hi>Action,</hi> we are led to the Knowledge of the <hi>Faculty;</hi> and from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> again we are carry'd on to the <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Now we muſt take notice by the way, that the Actions may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53648:59"/>be obſtructed, ſuſpended, or a final Stop, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Ceſſation put to them, without any Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice at all being done by this means to the <hi>Soul,</hi> or its Faculties: As the Skill and Faculty of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall remain entire in the Artiſt, tho' his Hands be ty'd up, or he be otherwiſe diſabled from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting that Skill. But, upon a Suppoſal that the <hi>Faculties</hi> themſelves periſh, the <hi>Soul</hi> muſt periſh with them; as the Fire can be no longer Fire, if we ſuppoſe the Faculty of Warming to be taken away from it.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> being thus in ſome meaſure explain'd, <note place="margin">In Vaity.</note> there is another Enquiry which offers it ſelf to our Conſideration, and That indeed of very great Intricacy and Importance both, which is, Whether each Animal (but more eſpecially each Man) have a <hi>Complication of ſeveral Souls,</hi> or but <hi>One</hi> only. Concerning which a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Arguments have been offer'd on all Sides, and great variety of Opinions have grown; but they may, I think, be reduc'd to Three. Some of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, and almoſt all the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> after Their Examples, have fancied that there is but <hi>One Immortal Soul,</hi> not only in each diſtinct Individual Perſon, but in all Mankind; and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted throughout the whole Species in general. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> are in the other Extreme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that each Perſon hath <hi>ſeveral Souls</hi> totally and eſſentially diſtinct from one another. That every Brute hath <hi>Two</hi> of theſe, and every Man hath <hi>Three. Two</hi> of which (the Vegetative and Senſitive) are Mortal; and the <hi>Third</hi> (which is the Intellectual) Immortal. The Third Opinion lies between theſe Two, and as it is more moderate, ſo hath it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been more generally entertain'd than either of the Former; for moſt Nations ſeem to be agreed, that however Men may have been oblig'd to conſider the ſeveral Faculties diſtinctly, yet there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53648:59"/>is in reality no actual Plurality, and but <hi>One Soul</hi> in each Perſon, which extends to all thoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſign'd to ſeveral.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Opinions I ſhall ſay nothing to, thinking it too abſurd, and too generally exploded, to ſtand in need of any particular Confutation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> which aſſerts a <hi>Plurality of Souls</hi> in each Animal, and particularly in each Man, muſt be confeſs'd on the one hand exceeding marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if not altogether incredible and abſurd; For what Philoſophy will allow us in giving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eſſential Forms to one and the ſame thing? But then, on the other hand, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd too, that this Notion makes the Way fair and ſmooth for that of the <hi>Intellectual Soul's</hi> being Immortal: Becauſe upon a Suppoſition of <hi>Three diſtinct Souls,</hi> there is no great Difficulty or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in admitting that <hi>Two</hi> of theſe may die, without at all impairing the Immortality of the <hi>Third;</hi> Whereas the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> ſeems to make War upon its Immortality: For which way can we conceive the ſame Thing to be Mortal in one part, and Immortal in another? which yet ſeems to have been <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Notion. Certainly there is an abſolute neceſſity of concluding, that it is All of a piece in this reſpect, and either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Mortal or Immortal throughout; which yet are each of them loaded with very abſurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: For the Former Concluſion is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of all Religion and ſound Philoſophy; and the Latter advances the Brutes to the ſame Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſame Immortal State with our Selves. But the moſt general, and in my poor Judgment, the moſt probable Opinion is, that each Animal hath but <hi>One Soul;</hi> but <hi>One</hi> in Subſtance; That This is the Cauſe of Life, and the Univerſal Source of all the Actions perform'd by him; That though
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53648:60"/>it have but <hi>One Eſſence</hi> entire and undivided, yet is it adorn'd, enrich'd, diverſify'd with a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Faculties and diſtinct Powers, wonderfully different, and ſome contrary to each other; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vaſt Variety of Inſtruments made uſe of by it, the Veſſels in which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and the Objects they are employ'd about; Thus the <hi>Soul</hi> exerciſes what we call the Senſitive and Reaſonable Faculties more peculiarly in the <hi>Brain;</hi> there being the Inſtruments adapted to ſuch Operations: The Vital and Iraſcible in the <hi>Heart;</hi> the Natural and Vegetative, (which are ſometimes diſtinguiſh'd by the Concupiſcible) in the <hi>Liver:</hi> Theſe are the Chief and moſt Material Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But theſe ſo many, and ſo different Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inſtruments, and Faculties, no more impair the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> or argue a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> than a Multitude of Streams conclude againſt One Fountain or common Source; or the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Effects of the Sun-Beams prove more Suns than One in the Univerſe: For thus we daily ſee he ſheds his Rays, and ſhines upon different Places and Objects with very different Succeſs: To One he adminiſters <hi>Heat;</hi> to Another <hi>Light:</hi> The Wax he ſoftens and melts; the Clay he dries and ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens: He makes the Snow Whiter, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion Blacker: He ſcatters the Clouds, and contracts the ſtanding Pools. And if all this be done by One Sun in the Firmament, what ſhou'd hinder the Former to be effected by <hi>One Soul</hi> in the <hi>Body?</hi> Why ſhou'd That be admitted for an Argument againſt the Eſſential Unity of the Cauſe in One of theſe Inſtances, which we our ſelves are content to allow, and conſtant Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes it plain beyond all Contradiction, is of no weight at all in a Caſe ſo very parallel as This I have laſt mention'd.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53648:60"/>
                     <p> As to the <hi>other Difficulty,</hi> which relates to the Soul's <hi>Immortality,</hi> when the Matter is carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will appear, that this Opinion of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Humane Soul, does it no manner of Injury. For this Soul does not ſuffer in its proper Eſſence, by the Death of the Vegetative and Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculties; by which Death in Reality is meant no more, than an Incapacity of exerciſing, and exerting thoſe Powers in a State of Separation from the Body. Which muſt neceſſarily follow, upon the Want and Abſence of the Proper Subject, and Inſtrument, to exerciſe them upon. But all this hinders not, but that the <hi>Third</hi> and moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is the <hi>Intellectual Faculty,</hi> may ſtill exert it ſelf; becauſe a Body, though at preſent it be made uſe of as its Inſtrument, is not yet ſo neceſſary and eſſential to that, that it ſhould not be able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and act without it. Suppoſing then this <hi>Soul</hi> to return to the <hi>Body</hi> a ſecond time, it would return at the ſame time to the Exerciſe of its Vegetative and Senſitive Powers, as we ſee plainly by Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Perſons, who have been raiſed from the Dead, to live here below: But this would not infer a Neceſſity of the ſame things for living in another State. For thoſe Faculties, whoſe Exerciſe ſupports this Life we now lead, are not thereby proved of ſuch Conſequence, that no other kind of Life could be ſupported or enjoyed without them. It is in this Caſe with the <hi>Soul,</hi> as with the <hi>Sun</hi> (for the ſame Inſtance will be of Uſe to illuſtrate our Argument in this Branch alſo) which continues the ſame in himſelf, every whit as entire and unblemiſhed, not in any Degree enfeebled, though his Luſtre and Vital Influences be ſometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and obſtructed. When his Face is cover'd with a <hi>Total Eclipſe,</hi> we loſe the cheerful Light and cheriſhing Heat; but though no ſenſible Effects of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53648:61"/>him appear, yet he is in his own Nature, the ſame Powerful Principle, and Glorious Creature ſtill.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Former of theſe Particulars, great Diſputes have been maintained, by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Divines of all Ages. Concerning the <hi>Origine</hi> of the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Intellectual Soul,</hi> I mean; for as to the <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Senſitive</hi> attributed to Plants and Beaſts, thoſe by general Conſent have been eſteemed to conſiſt intirely of <hi>Matter,</hi> to be transferred with the <hi>Seminal Principles,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſubject to Corruption and Death. So that the whole Controverſy turns upon the ſingle Point of the Humane Soul; and concerning this, the <hi>Four</hi> moſt Celebrated Opinions have been theſe which follow. I omit the Mention of any more, which are almoſt loſt in the Crowd, becauſe Theſe have obtained ſo much more generally, and gained greater Credit than the Reſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe is that Notion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> embraced by <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, and after Him, by the <hi>Manichees, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and others. This maintains Reaſonable Souls to be ſo many Extracts, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Productions of the Divine Spirit; Partakers of the very ſame Nature and Subſtance with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf; who being ſaid expreſly to have breathed it into the Body; theſe Perſons have taken the Advantage of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Words, and fixed the ſublimeſt Senſe imaginable upon them. <hi>He Breathed into him the Breath of Life;</hi> by which they are not content to underſtand, that the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is a diſtinct Thing, and of a different, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Original than the Body; a Spirit of greater
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53648:61"/>Excellence than that which quickens any other Animal, but they ſtretch it to a Communication of God's own Eſſence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> was deriv'd from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> receiv'd by <hi>Tertullian, Apollinaris,</hi> the Sect of the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> and ſome other Chriſtians; and This aſſerts the Soul to be derived from our Parents, as the Body is; and in the ſame Manner, and from the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with that, whence the Soul of Brutes, and all that are confin'd to Senſe and Vegetation only, are generally believ'd to ſpring.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is that of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;</hi> entertained by moſt of the Rabbinical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Jewiſh Doctors; and after them by <hi>Origen,</hi> and ſome other Chriſtian Doctors too; Which pretends that all Souls were created by God at the beginning of the World; that they were then by Him commanded, and made out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that they are reſerv'd and depoſited in ſome of the Heavenly Regions; and afterwards, as his Infinite Wiſdom ſees Occaſion, ſent down hither into Bodies ready fitted for, and diſpoſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. Upon this Opinion was built another, of Souls being <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> dealt with here below, and lodged in ſound and healthful, or elſe in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſickly Bodies, according to their <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Ill</hi> Behaviour in a State and Region above, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their being thus Incorporated with theſe Mortal and Fleſhly Tabernacles. How generally this Notion prevail'd, we have a notable Hint from that great Maſter of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> who gives this Account of his large improvements,<note place="margin">Wiſd. VIII. 19, 20.</note> above the common Rate of <hi>Men, I was a Witty Child, and had a good Spirit; yea, rather being Good, I came into a Body undefiled.</hi> Thus intimating a Priority of Time, as well as of Order and Dignity in the Soul, and that its good Diſpoſitions qualified it for a Body ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed too.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53648:62"/>
                     <p> The <hi>Fourth,</hi> which hath met with the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Approbation, among Chriſtians Eſpecially, holds that the <hi>Soul</hi> is created by God, infus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body prepared duly for its Reception: That it hath no Pre-exiſtence in any ſeparate State, or former Vehicle, but that its Creation and Infuſion are both of the ſame Date.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Four</hi> Opinions, are all of them Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. There is yet a <hi>Fifth,</hi> more modeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd than any of the former. This undertakes not to determine Poſitively one way or other; but is content Ingenuouſly to confeſs its own Ignorance and Uncertainty: declares this a Matter of very abſtruſe Speculation, a dark and deep Myſtery, which God hath not thought fit particularly to reveal; and which Man by the Strength, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of his own Reaſon, can know but very little or nothing of. Of this Opinion we find St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſome others. But though they preſume not ſo far, as to give any definitive Sentence, on any Side; yet they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to think, that, of the <hi>Four</hi> Opinions here mention'd; the <hi>Two</hi> latter carry a greater Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth, than the <hi>Two</hi> former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But how, <note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Body.</note> and when this <hi>Humane Soul</hi> (for of the <hi>Brutal</hi> there is little or no Diſpute, nor is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enquiry concerned in it) Whether This, I ſay, make its Entrance all at once, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Approaches are gradual and ſlow; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it attain its juſt Eſſential Perfections in an Inſtant; or whether it grow up to them, by Time and Succeſſion; is another very great Queſtion. The More general Opinion, which ſeems to have come from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is, That the <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Soul,</hi> whoſe Eſſence is no other than Matter and Body, is in the Principles of Generation; that it deſcends lineally, and is derived to us from the Subſtance of our Parents; that This is finiſhed and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53648:62"/>Perfected in Time and by Degrees, and Nature acts in this Caſe a little like Art, when That undertakes to form the Image of a Man; where firſt the Out-Lines and rude Sketches are drawn; then the Features ſpecified; yet Theſe, not of his whole Body at once, but firſt the Painter finiſhes the Head, then the Neck, after that the Breaſt, the Legs and ſo on, till he have drawn the whole Length. Thus the <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Senſitive Soul</hi> (they tell you) forms the Body in the Womb: and when That is finiſhed, and made fit for the Reception of its new Inhabitant, the <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> comes from abroad, and takes Poſſeſſion of its Dwelling. But that (all this notwithſtanding) They are not <hi>Two,</hi> nor <hi>Three diſtinct Souls,</hi> neither together, nor in Succeſſion. That the Vegetative ſuffers no Diminution by the Acceſſion of the Senſitive; nor that again by the Addition of the Intelligent Mind. But all Thoſe coaleſce into One, and are form'd and finiſhed, according to the ſtated Times, and uſual Proceſs of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Others rather incline to believe, that the Soul enters the Body entire, and takes Poſſeſſion with her Faculties of every kind at the ſame Inſtant: That This is done, when all the Organs of the Body are framed, and the whole Shell finiſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted: that till Then, the Body is only a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dead Maſs, without any Soul at all: that it had only a Virtue or Natural Energy, (The Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form of that Matter out of which it is made) and this acting upon the Spirituous Parts, does, by the Agitation and Ferment Theſe are put into, form and build the whole Body, and adjuſt every Part of this Structure duly. When things are brought to this Head, then that Energy vaniſhes, and is quite loſt, and the Soul ſucceeds into its Place. And when this New, this Noble Gueſt arrives, all things change their Form; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53648:63"/>That, which before was nothing but Dead Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Matter,</hi> exalts its Name and Nature, and from thenceforth commences <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> When it hath actually entred the Body, we ſhall do well to know after what Manner it exiſts,<note place="margin">Its Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the manner of it.</note> and dwells in it. Some Philoſophers, whoſe Notions of this Matter ſeem to have been much perlex'd, and at a mighty Loſs, how to make out any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Conjunction between theſe Two, have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd the Soul to reſide in the Body, like a Maſter in his Houſe, or the Pilot in a Ship. But though, as to the Governing and Directing Part, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon be not much amiſs; yet when applied to explain the particular Mode of its Exiſtence, it is abſolutely improper, and ſtark naught. For at this rate the Soul would not be the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>Eſſential</hi> Part of the Animal or the Man: It would have no Occaſion for the Members of this Body to give it reception; would not be affected in any kind from this cloſe Affinity, nor have any of thoſe tender and mutual Reſentments and Sufferings, ariſing from Bodily Pains and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but would be a Subſtance entirely diſtinct: ſubſiſting from and by it ſelf; at its own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to go or come to ſeparate from the Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any Difference in it; or any way taking from its own Functions, or the Exerciſe of them. All which are intolerable and moſt notorious Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. The Soul then in the Body, is like <hi>Form</hi> in <hi>Matter,</hi> diſperſed and extended over every Part of it: Giving Life, Motion, and Senſe, all thorough; and both Theſe taken together, make one Perſon or <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> that is, one entire Subject, which we call an <hi>Animal.</hi> Nor are we to be Solicitous for the finding out any intermediate Quality, which ſhould connect theſe Two; for there is no ſuch thing in Nature. All Philoſophers conſenting in This, That there can nothing come between <hi>Matter</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53648:63"/>and <hi>Form,</hi> no Common Link or Band more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate for them. The Soul then is <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all</hi> the Body; but as for what is commonly added, of its being <hi>all</hi> in <hi>every</hi> Part too, I forbear the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; becauſe, in my Apprehenſion, it divides the Soul, and implies a Contradiction.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Now, <note place="margin">The Seat of the Soul.</note> although the Soul (in Agreement to what we have but juſt now aſſerted) be really commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and diffuſed, through the whole Body in <hi>general;</hi> yet it muſt be acknowledged, that ſhe is more <hi>Eminently</hi> preſent and powerful, in ſome Parts than others.

In regard therefore that the Soul is Remarkable for the Exerciſe of Four Predominant Faculties above the Reſt; Four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Places of Action and Reſidence have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly been aſſigned to her.

Now we ſhall do well to take Notice that the very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of every living Creature, coſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53648:64"/>in This Soul, it cannot be, but the Soul muſt be abundantly provided with neceſſary <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and underſtand its Buſineſs, without Pains or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or the ſlow and laborious Methods of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Inſtruction. As certain is it too, that what ſhe is thus inſtructed in by Nature, ſhe fails not to exert, and punctually to fulfil, as Need requires. Provided no Accidental Obſtruction prevent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt her, and that the Inſtrument ſhe is obliged to make Uſe of, be rightly diſpoſed to follow her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. The Philoſophers therefore were much in the Right, when they ſtiled Nature a Wiſe, Skilful, and Induſtrious School-Miſtreſs: One that qualifies her Children and Scholars for all that is required from them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſita ſunt nobis omnium artium ac virtutum Semina.

                        <hi>The Seeds of all Art and Virtue</hi> (ſays one of them) <hi>are implanted in us Originally; and Almighty God, the Great Maſter, brings forward our Natural Abilities, and draws them forth into Action.</hi> It were eaſy to prove this, by pregnant Inſtances of every Kind. The <hi>Vegetative Soul</hi> of its own Accord, without Artifice or Inſtitution, forms the <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Womb, ſo curiouſly, ſo conveniently, ſo wonderfully, that we can never ſufficiently expreſs, and extol the Excellence of this Skill. Afterwards it takes equal Care of the Nouriſhment and Growth; conveys, ſeeks, and receives Suſtenance; Retains what is eaten; digeſts and lives upon it; throws off the Superfluous and Excremental Parts; Refreſhes, recruits, repairs thoſe Parts which ſink or faint, or fall to decay. And Theſe are all of them Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Manifeſt and Conſtant, not in Men only, but in Brutes and Plants alſo.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Senſitive Soul</hi> in like manner, of her own Accord puts Men and Brutes upon all neceſſary Actions. Such as Moving their Feet, their Hands,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53648:64"/>and Other Limbs and Parts, which may be of uſe to them, to ſcratch, to rub, to ſhake themſelves, to ſuck, to manage their Lips and Mouth, to cry, to laugh, and other Expreſſions of Want, and Grief, and Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Reaſonable</hi> and <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> does the very ſame thing in Its Capacity: And Thus it acts not by virtue of any Reminiſcence, or Recollection of any Knowledge it had before with this Union with the Body, as <hi>Plato</hi> fondly imagin'd; a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which proceeds upon the ſuppoſal of another State, in which the Soul pre-exiſted before its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into, or the Formation of this Body; Nor does it owe this Power to Knowledge receiv'd in at the Senſes, and acquir'd by Their means upon Uſe and Obſervation, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conceives, who repreſents the Soul at the Birth, to be a <hi>Perfect Blank,</hi> utterly void of all Characters or Images, but ready to receive Impreſſions of any kind: But it ſeems rather to diſcharge this Office by the Original Strength of its own Native Powers: It Imagines, Underſtands, Retains, Argues, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Concludes of it ſelf, without any Inſtruction or additional Helps at all. This Aſſertion, I muſt own, ſeems more difficult to comprehend than the Former; and we can more readily aſſent to ſuch a Native Aptitude in the <hi>Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Senſitive,</hi> than we do in the <hi>Intellectual Soul.</hi> It is manifeſt too, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Authority lies in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree againſt the Thing: And therefore to ſatisfie all theſe Difficulties, I will allow this Matter a more particular Conſideration, when we come to diſcourſe of the <hi>Intellectual Soul</hi> diſtinctly.</p>

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:53648:65"/>Only herein is a mighty difference between Other Animals and Mankind, that when the Reſt die, their Soul dies too; agreeably to that Rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, <hi>That when the Subject-Matter is corrupted, the Form is perfectly loſt, though the Matter ſtill remain.</hi> Whereas the Soul of Man is indeed ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his Body by Death, but by no means loſt or annihilated: So far from Periſhing, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire and unhurt, as having the Privilege of an Immortal and Incorruptible Nature.</p>
                     <p>There is not in the World any One Opinion which hath been more univerſally entertain'd, more eagerly embrac'd, more plauſibly defended, more religiouſly ſtuck to (I may well ſay Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, ſince this Doctrine is in truth the very Foundation of all Religion) than That which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the <hi>Immortality of the Soul.</hi> All this now is meant of an External and Publick Profeſſion; for, alas! it is but too manifeſt and too melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Truth; (and the prodigious numbers of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Epicures, abandon'd Libertines, and prophane Scoffers at God and a Future State, bear Teſtimony to it;) That what Pretence ſoever the Generality of the World may make of receiving this Doctrine in Words and Speculation, there are but very few who expreſs an inward Senſe, and ſerious Belief of it, by living like Men that believe it indeed. Of that practical Aſſent, I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeak more largely hereafter. In the mean while, give me leave to lament, that ſo little and ſo poor Effects appear, of an Opinion capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſo many and ſo noble: For certainly there is not any one Point whatſoever, the Perſuaſion whereof can bring greater Benefit, or have a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Influence upon Mankind.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53648:65"/>But it muſt be confeſs'd, that there are ſeveral other things, which Men are content to yield their Credit to, upon far more weak and inſufficient Suggeſtions.

But yet to ſhew the Importance of this Doctrine, even Nature herſelf hath implanted in all Mankind a ſtrong Inclination to think it true: For it is natural for us to deſire the legthening out, nay the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our own Exiſtence. And no Reflection is more uneaſie, than That which attempts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us that we muſt <hi>once ceaſe to be.</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is interwoven with our very Frame; and hath given Birth to another no leſs general than it ſelf, which is That anxious Care, and impatient Regard for Poſterity, that takes ſuch faſt hold on every Man of us.</p>
                     <p>Nor wou'd I be ſo far miſunderſtood, as to have it thought, that this Diſpoſition of Mind is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Humane Foundation upon which our Belief of the <hi>Soul's Immortality</hi> ſtands: For there are <hi>Two</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moral Arguments in particular, which give it great Credit, and, to ſay the very leaſt of the Caſe, render it exceeding probable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that Hope of Glory and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the tender Care of preſerving a Good Name when we are gone; nay, the Thought and Endeavour that our Fame ſhou'd be Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Now though I cannot but condemn this ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude of Vanity, when Men pretend to place their <hi>Happineſs</hi> in the <hi>Opinions</hi> of other People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves are dead; yet the marvellous Regard, and univerſal Concern Mankind expreſs for it, ſeems to ſay, that Nature inſpires thoſe Deſires and Expectations. And Nature, we know, is a <hi>Wiſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53648:66"/>Agent,</hi> and does not uſe to cheat Men with Hopes, which are altogether impoſſible and vain.</p>
                     <p>Another Reaſon, not eaſie to be got over by Them who oppoſe this Doctrine, is, That common Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that Thoſe Crimes which are committed in ſecret, or which otherwiſe eſcape the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Puniſhment of Civil Juſtice, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Man, are ſtill reſerv'd to a farther Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning; that Almighty God ſupplies the Defects of Temporal Judicatures, and hath a ſevere Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſtore for ſuch Offenders as Thoſe cannot extend to. And ſince we find by frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that many Enormities of this kind are not made the Marks of the Divine Vengeance in The Preſent World; it is a good Conſequence of all the Idea's we can reaſonably entertain of God, that He ſhou'd purſue the Guilty Wretches into another World, and chaſtiſe them as they deſerve, even after Death. And now I wou'd be glad to know, what greater Moral Aſſurance can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for a Subject of this kind, than, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature diſpoſes every Man to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to it, to deſire, and to think it probable; and that the Conſideration of the Divine Juſtice, repreſents it as a thing not only greatly probable, but abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>This laſt Reflexion will lead us to the Diſcovery of Three different Kinds and Degrees of Souls; all which become proper Objects of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: Nor need we credit it upon that Account only, but even Natural Reaſon, the Order and Harmony of the Univerſe will perſuade us, that ſuch a ſort of Being, and ſo Immortal as we have been deſcribing the Humane Soul, is requiſite to make the Series of the Creation Beautiful and Complete. Of theſe Three ſorts we may obſerve that Two are in Extremes: The One conſiſting of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53648:66"/>ſuch Souls as are groſs; ſunk down, immerſt in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from, and compounded of <hi>meer Matter:</hi> Such are the Souls of <hi>Brutes.</hi> The Other quite contrary, ſuch as have no manner of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with <hi>Matter</hi> and Body, as <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirits,</hi> whether Good or Bad. In the midſt, and between theſe two, is the <hi>Humane Soul;</hi> and this is neither entirely and neceſſarily confin'd and faſten'd to <hi>Matter,</hi> nor entirely ſeparated from it, but joyn'd and wedded to it in this preſent State; yet ſo, that its Divorce is not its Deſtruction, but it can ſubſiſt and live without <hi>Matter</hi> in Another State.</p>
                     <p>Such an Order and Diſtinction as This, is no deſpicable Argument for the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> ſince otherwiſe we muſt ſuppoſe a wide Gap, a vaſt Defect, and foul Deformity in Nature, ſuch as carries Abſurdity in it ſelf, caſts a Reflexion upon its Author, and threatens Ruine to the World. Which is ſupported by nothing more than by the Gradual and Contiguous Order and Succeſſion of the Creatures: And therefore between Diſtances ſo wide as altogether <hi>Corruptible,</hi> and abſolutely <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> Nature requires ſome middle Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Subſtance, partly the One, and partly the Other. Such a Link as this is neceſſary to tye the two Ends of this Chain together; and ſuch a Link can be no other Creature than <hi>Man:</hi> For if we carry our Thoughts farther, we ſhall find that Other Beings are without the Compaſs of this Length, and ſo there are <hi>Five Stages</hi> of <hi>Beings</hi> in all. One below the meaneſt, and even thoſe Souls which are ſaid to conſiſt entirely of <hi>Matter,</hi> ſuch as Stones, which we cannot ſay have any Soul at all. <hi>Another</hi> far above even the moſt exalted, the moſt pure, and immortal Souls; which is the <hi>Ever-Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Only God.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But beſides the Separation of the Soul already treated of, <note place="margin">Separation Unnatural.</note> there is Another Unnatural and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common One; and this happens by Fits and Starts, is out of the way, and conſequently very intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and hard to give our ſelves any tolerable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of: Such I mean as comes upon Men in Extaſies and Raptures, which, as they differ very much in their Symptoms and Circumſtances, ſo do they likewiſe in their Cauſes and Occaſions. Of theſe ſome are <hi>Divine Extaſies,</hi> wrought by the expreſs and immediate Operation of God: Such are thoſe Trances which the Scripture takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, in <hi>Araham, Daniel, Ezechiel, Zacharias,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Others are <hi>Daemoniacal,</hi> procur'd by the Interpoſition of Good or Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, many whereof are mention'd in Story: And we are told of <hi>John Duns-Scotus</hi> in particular, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lain a long time in a Trance, and being taken for dead, he was carry'd to be bury'd, and put into his Grave; but being rouz'd with the Blows and Bruiſes of the Mould thrown upon him, he came to himſelf, and was taken up again; and in a few Days after dy'd in good earneſt, with the loſs of Blood, and the Bruiſes he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon his Head. <hi>Cardan</hi> mentions ſomewhat of this Nature, with which both Himſelf and his Father were poſſeſſed. And many Creditable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Relations have been made from ſeveral diſtant parts of the World, of abundance of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, moſt of them of the Vulgar ſort, too weak and ignorant to contrive ſuch Stories; and of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men poſſeſſed, whoſe Bodies have not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd long without any Senſe, or Motion, or Pulſe, but have been cut, bruiſed, burnt, without ever feeing it, and afterwards when they came to themſelves, they have complain'd of intolerable Torture, and exquiſite Pain, and have given very ſtrange Accounts of what they have ſeen and done in places a great way off.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53648:67"/>
                     <p> A <hi>Third</hi> Separation there is, which we may call <hi>Humane,</hi> becauſe proceeding from Humane Means, and ſuch as no Superiour or Inviſible Power ſeems to be concern'd in: This comes either from that Diſeaſe which from <hi>Hippoerates</hi> is call'd <hi>Morbus Sacer,</hi> but commonly known by the Name of the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> (attended with Foamings at the Mouth, which are lookt upon as the Mark and Character of it, and diſtinguiſh this Diſtemper from Poſſeſſions, in which the Patients are ſaid to have none of theſe Frothings, but a very noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Stench in the room of them:) Or this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be owing to the Force of Stupifying and Sleeping Medicines: Or to the Strength of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which being vehemently intent upon ſome One thing, perfectly carries away the Soul, and renders it ſtupid and inſenſible to all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects beſides.</p>
                     <p>Now in theſe Three kinds of Extaſie and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport, whether <hi>Divine, Daemoniacal,</hi> or <hi>Humane,</hi> the great Doubt ariſing is, Whether the <hi>Soul</hi> be really and truly ſeparated from the <hi>Body;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any ſuch Separation, it ſtill continue there, but be ſo entirely taken up with ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Object, as perfectly to forget the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it: So that its Natural Operations, and the Exerciſe of its proper Offices and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are, during that time, ſuſpended, and wholly ſuperſeded.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Divine Extaſies;</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Himſelf, and what happen'd in his own Caſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> will not preſume to define any thing: * <hi>Whether in the Body, or out of the Body I cannot tell,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>God knoweth.</hi> And this Caution of His, is methinks a good Warning to all other People, that They too ſhou'd be modeſt and reſerv'd, and not raſh in determining any thing poſitively, not only in Theſe, but even in leſs Abſtractions of the Mind.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53648:68"/>
                     <p> As to the Second Caſe, That of <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> Their having no ſenſe of great Blows, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Tortures, and reporting things tranſacted at Two or Three Hundred Leagues diſtance; theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs are great Conjectures, and very violent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of an actual Separation; but yet, I think, they are not concluſive and neceſſary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it: For the Devils may amuſe the Soul, and keep it ſo fully employ'd even when at home, that it ſhall have no Commerce or Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Body for ſome conſiderable time; and at the very ſame time too he may repreſent to the Imagination what paſſes at a great diſtance, in ſo lively and clear a manner, as to fool the Man with a Perſuaſion, that he hath really been there, and ſeen thoſe very things which the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thus ſtrongly imprinted upon his Fancy, have enabled him ſo particularly to relate. How far the Activity of Evil or Good Spirits extends, is not poſſible for us to ſay. But it is a very bold Aſſertion, and what Nature will very hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that the Whole Soul, formally taken, goes out, and abandons the Body; for upon theſe Terms the Body muſt die to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: And ſuch Mens coming to themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, wou'd not be a <hi>Recovery</hi> of their Senſes, but a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead. And yet to ſay, That the Soul does not All go, but the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Intellectual Faculties rove aboad, while the Vegetative ſtay behind and keep Houſe, is ſtill more Monſtrous and Abſurd: For at this rate, the Soul, which is entire, and One in her Eſſence, wou'd be divided; or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe the Accident only to be tranſported and born away, and the Subſtance to remain fixed in its proper place; and therefore we have reaſon to admit any other Solution of the Caſe, rather than that of an Actual Separation.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53648:68"/>
                     <p> As to the Third and Laſt ſort, which was term'd <hi>Humane,</hi> the Thing is clear beyond a Doubt, that there is no real Separation in it, ſince all that can be pretended to in this Caſe, amounts to no more than ſome preſent Stupefaction and Diſorder, by means whereof ſuch of the Soul's Operations as are Viſible and External, ceaſe in appearance, and are ſuſpended for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>What becomes of this <hi>Soul,</hi> and in what State or Condition ſhe continues after that Real and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Separation made by <hi>Death,</hi> Wiſe Men have not been able to agree; nor does this Point fall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the Compaſs and Deſign of the preſent Treatiſe. The <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> of Souls, advanced by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> hath found (in ſome parts of the Notion eſpecially) tolerable good acceptance with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> the <hi>Academicks,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and ſome others. Not that they all admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in the ſame Senſe and Extent, or to all the Purpoſes he intended it ſhou'd ſerve: Some allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it only ſo far as it might contribute to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Wicked Men, who might ſuffer by being turn'd into Brutes, in a manner like that miraculous Infliction upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. iv.</note> as a Scourge from God for his Vanity and Atheiſtical Pride. Some again, and thoſe of conſiderable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and Authority, have imagin'd, that Pure and Pious Souls, upon their quitting this Body, are tranſlated into Angels; and the Black and Guilty ones transform'd into Fiends and Devils. Methinks it were more prudent to ſoften the former Branch of this Notion, as our Bleſſed Saviour hath done already, by ſaying,<note place="margin">Luke xx.</note> 
                        <hi>That they neither marry nor die any more, but are as the Angels, and are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> Some again have fancied, that the Souls of the wickedeſt and moſt profligate Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, after a very long Term of Time and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, utterly periſh, and are reduc'd to their Firſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53648:69"/>Nothing. But Humane Reaſon is, and muſt needs be for ever, in the Dark about all ſuch Matters. And therefore theſe Diſquiſitions ſhou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly referr'd to their proper Topick of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For, as nothing but <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> can inform us truly in what concerns a Future State, ſo they have not been wanting to declare what is full and ſufficient for our purpoſe, and therefore it is our <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to receive this without more ado, and ſtedfaſtly to reſt in it.</p>
                     <div type="notice">

                        <p>IN the Second Particular which concerns the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Nature of the Soul, the Author makes a very odd Diſtinction between <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and tries to reconcile the Opinion of Thoſe who ſay the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>Immaterial,</hi> with Theirs who affirm it to be <hi>Corporeal.</hi> The Reſult of which is, That the Souls of Men do not conſiſt of groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Matter, but of a Body thin and ſubtle, even beyond all Imagination: And therefore in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Diſcourſe, he continues to make a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Souls of Men and thoſe of Brutes, even in this very Point of Materiality it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But now, Since <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> ſtrictly and Philoſophically taken, come all to one; and ſince No Subtlety, or Fineneſs of Compoſition makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Body the leſs a Material Subſtance; Since again the Humane and Intellectual Soul hath evidently ſeveral Faculties, and performs ſeveral Operations, (ſuch as <hi>Cogitation, Volition,</hi> nay even <hi>Senſation</hi> it ſelf) which are neither inherent Qualities of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſuch; nor what any Motion or Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever, can render it capable of; <hi>Monſieur Charron</hi>'s Subtlety of the Body will not help the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53648:69"/>Cauſe at all: For <hi>Aethereal,</hi> or <hi>Coeleſtial Bodies</hi> are as truly <hi>Matter</hi> as any of the Courſeſt and Groſſeſt whatſoever. And the Notion of <hi>Matter</hi> is not to be taken from its Purity or Foeculency, its Palpabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or its Fineneſs; but from its Eſſential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuch as Extenſion, and quantity, Diviſibility, Being purely Paſſive, and Acting only as it is acted upon; Its being ſubject to the Laws of Motion; and the like: Theſe now are the inſeparable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of every thing that is <hi>Body;</hi> and from hence it muſt needs follow, that all Bodies whatſoever are equally diſtant from, equally unqualify'd for Thought, and Perception, and all other Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Faculties, which are the proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Characters of a Reaſonable Soul. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, if my Reader deſire farther Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than the Nature of a ſingle <hi>Advertiſement</hi> allows me room for, I referr him to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Second Sermon againſt Atheiſm, where he will find this Argument handled at large.</p>
                        <p>When once ſuch an Abſurdity as This hath been ſhewn to attend that Notion which maintains the Soul's Corporeity; it is to very little Purpoſe to urge us with the Difficulties concerning the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intercourſe of our Souls and Bodies; or what the Soul ſuffers either in her united, or in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate State: Some of which are capable of the ſame Reſolutions with thoſe given in the Caſe of Brutes, (by thoſe Philoſophers who allow them Senſe:) and are not the Actions or Affections of the Intelligent, but of the Senſitive Powers: And for Others, which are ſuperiour to Humane Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, we acknowledge our Ignorance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all into the ſole <hi>Will,</hi> and wonderful <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of our Almighty Creator. He hath not told us what is the Band of Union between theſe Two; nor how this Communication and intimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence is kept up, and carry'd on: And we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53648:70"/>think it is impoſſible for any to acquaint us with this Proceſs, except Him only, who contrived and conſtituted it. But Ten Thouſand ſuch Objections weigh little, when balanc'd againſt a Flaw in the very Foundation: Every thing at this rate may be diſputed, and <hi>Univerſal Scepticiſm</hi> be advanced, for we are able to trace nothing through all its Motions and Operations. But an Argument <hi>ab Abſurdo,</hi> made evident in the Firſt and moſt ſubſtantial Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is allowed, even in that Science, which profeſſes the greateſt accuracy in Arguing, to be a Juſt and Legitimate Demonſtration againſt any thing, which ſuch Principles are alledged to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus given a General Deſcription of the Soul in the Ten Points already inſiſted on, I come in the next Place to treat of it ſomewhat more diſtinctly; by conſidering its reſpective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Faculties</hi> apart. And the moſt convenient Order, as I apprehend, will be to begin with the Loweſt firſt, and ſo proceed from the <hi>Vegetative</hi> to the <hi>Senſitive,</hi> from thence to that of <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Appetite,</hi> and laſt of all to the <hi>Intellectual,</hi> which is the Supreme of all the Faculties, and that which is the true and peculiar Character of the Humane
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53648:70"/>Soul. Under each of Theſe, there are ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers, of leſs Note and Figure, which hold, as Branches of, or Deputies under thoſe, and will fall in naturally to be mentioned, in the Profecution of that Method I have here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                     <p>As for That, which concerns <hi>Vegetation,</hi> it is the meaneſt by much, and given us in common with the very Plants. I ſhall therefore ſay but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it, not only becauſe the ſubject is not of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough to bear me out in long Enlargements; but alſo becauſe this is more properly the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Phyſicians, whoſe Profeſſion leads to the Study of Health and Sickneſs, the Preſervatives of the One, and the Remedies againſt the Other. I ſhall only call upon my Reader at preſent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that under this Faculty, there are Three Great and very Important Subalterns concerned, and each of them ſubſequent and aſſiſting to each other in a regular Progreſſion. For the Firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Second, and the Second the Third: but not ſo, as that the Order can be inverted, and the Remark hold back again.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe is the <hi>Nutritive;</hi> Inſtituted for the Preſervation of the Individual; and under This there are ſeveral Aſſiſtants, ſuch as the Attractive or ſeeking of Neceſſary Suſtenance; that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and Digeſtion, which ſeparates the good and uſeful Parts, from thoſe which are noxious and naughty: The Retentive for what is neceſſary, and the Expulſive, to throw off what is offenſive or ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>The Second is that of <hi>Growing,</hi> which tends to the Perfection of the Individual, and giving it all its juſt Proportions.</p>
                     <p>The Third is the <hi>Generative;</hi> for the Continuance and Succeſſion of the Species.</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53648:71"/>
                     <p> From hence now it is plain, that the Two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe were inſtituted by Nature, for the Sake and Benefit of the Individual; and terminate in the Advantage of one ſingle Perſon, and his own Body. The Third extends to the Species in general, and its Effects do not, cannot center in the Perſon himſelf; and therefore This, as more Extenſive and Beneficial, is eſteem'd ſuperiour in Dignity, to the other Two; and advancing nearer to That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty next above it, which is the Senſitive. For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ones own Likeneſs, is a very Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Nature, and gives us the Honour of ſome diſtant Reſemblances, even to the Great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour himſelf.</p>

                           <item>III. The <hi>Third</hi> thing neceſſary is the <hi>Bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> or <hi>Organ</hi> of <hi>Senſe;</hi> and theſe are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably <hi>Five</hi> too: The <hi>Eye</hi> for Sight; The <hi>Ear</hi> for Hearing; The <hi>Cavity</hi> at the Top of the Noſe (which goes into the firſt Ventricle of the Brain) for ſmelling: The <hi>Tongue</hi> for Taſting, and the <hi>Skin</hi> all over the Body for that of the Touch, or Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                           <item>IV. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Requiſite is that Animal Spirit, derived from the Brain, (which is the Origine and Seat of the Senſitive Soul) and conveighed through the Nerves, to theſe ſeveral Organs: by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mediation of which Spirit, and Organ, the Soul exerciſes her Faculty.</item>
                           <item>V. The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, what the Philoſophers were uſed to call the <hi>Species Senſibilis,</hi> which is in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Object which moves, and affects, or is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Organ: and This is of a different kind, according to the different Senſe excited, or applyed to by it. That of <hi>Sight,</hi> or the <hi>Eye</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commonly received Opinion,) is <hi>Colour;</hi> A Quality or Accident inherent in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy coloured. <hi>Six</hi> of theſe are Styled Simple Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as <hi>White, Yellow, Red, Purple, Green,</hi> and <hi>Blue:</hi> To which ſome add <hi>Black,</hi> and call them Seven. But, ſtrictly ſpeaking, Black is not any Colour, but only a Privation of Light, reſembling Darkneſs; as other Colours do more or leſs reſemble Light: The Number of Compounded Colours is infinite. And indeed if we go to the Philoſophical Nicety of the Thing, there is no Colour at all in any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whatſoever; for This is nothing elſe in Truth but the various Repreſentation, which Light diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently modified makes upon our Senſes. For when the Light is gone, all Colour is gone with it, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53648:72"/>as this never appears without ſome Colour, ſo it never diſappears, ſo as to leave Colour behind.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Light</hi> is a Quality proceeding from a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Body, which creates in us a Perception and Sight of it ſelf, and of all things elſe within our View. When this terminates upon, and is ſtopp'd by any ſolid Body, it rebounds back again, and doubles its Rays by Reflection: But if it peetrate the Body, and find farther Paſſage, it cannot be ſeen except only in its firſt Source, the Luminous Body from whence it was ſhed originally; nor does it then do us any Service in ſhewing other Objects.</p>
                     <p>The Object of <hi>Hearing</hi> is Sound; by which we are to underſtand that Noiſe which reſults from the mutual Colliſion of two Bodies; and this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry various: For ſome Sounds are ſweet and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious, they ſooth and charm the Soul, calm the Paſſions, compoſe the Humours of the Body, and chaſe away the Diſorders of the whole Man. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again are ſmart and piercing, ſtrike through the very Soul, wound and diſturb our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with an ungrateful Harſhneſs. But of all our Senſes, the Mind ſeems to be moſt under the Power of This; none entertains it with greater Variety; none takes more abſolute Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>The Object of <hi>Taſte</hi> is what we call Savour or Reliſhes; of which the Simple are <hi>Sweet, Bitter, Sour, Sharp, Salt, Acid:</hi> But of the Compounds there is no Number; they are made ſo exquiſite, and multiplied ſo induſtriouſly.</p>
                     <p>That of <hi>Smelling</hi> is Flavour; which is a ſort of Vapour ariſing from the Odoriferous Object, and aſcending through the Noſe into the firſt and moſt prominent Ventricles of the Brain. Such Perfumes as are very ſtrong, commit a ſort of Violence upon the Brain, and are prejudicial or offenſive to it: But thoſe that are agreeable and moderate, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53648:72"/>wonderful Comfort and Refreſhment, and both delight and do good to the Head.</p>
                     <p>The Objects of <hi>Feeling</hi> are ſuch as uſually are term'd the Tactile Qualities, <hi>Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry;</hi> to which we may add <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Sharp, Rough</hi> and <hi>Smooth, Motion</hi> and <hi>Reſt, Tickling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The Laſt thing which muſt concur in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is the <hi>Medium,</hi> or Space betwixt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the Organ; and this, to render the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration what it ought to be, is the <hi>Air,</hi> not in any wiſe changed or corrupted, but free, and in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Purity and Diſpoſition.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> From hence we may gather, That the Act of Senſation is perform'd, when the Object, or <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Species</hi> preſents it ſelf by the help of a <hi>Medium</hi> diſpos'd to convey this Repreſentation to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Organ ſitted to receive it; and that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits lodg'd there do accordingly take the Impreſſion, and apprehend the thing: So that here is <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> both; and the Senſes are not purely <hi>Paſſive;</hi> for, notwithſtanding that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Impreſſion, and in that reſpect are acted upon, yet do they likewiſe act in ſome Degree themſelves, ſo far as they perceive the Image, and apprehend the Object propounded to them.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The old Philoſophy before <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Time, made a very remarkable Difference between the <hi>Sight</hi> and the reſt of the Senſes: Suppoſing This to be meerly <hi>Active,</hi> and imagining, that, whereas the Others receiv'd the Object and Impreſſion from without, and ſo cou'd only be <hi>Paſſive;</hi> The Eye quite contrary ſhot out its Rays of Light from within, and made an Impreſſion upon the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object. But ever ſince <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> this Account of Viſion hath been better ſtated, and all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53648:73"/>are allow'd to be equally <hi>Paſſive,</hi> equally wrought upon from without: All the Arguments of the Ancients to the contrary being very eaſily anſwer'd and ſet aſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But now, beſides theſe Five particular Senſes, the Organs whereof appear outwardly, there is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which is call'd the <hi>Common Senſory</hi> within. Here it is that the ſeveral Objects of every ſort, perceiv'd by the Corporeal Organs, make their <hi>Rendezvous:</hi> Hither they are brought to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, compar'd, ſorted out, and diſtinguiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder: For were there no ſuch Office of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, all wou'd end in Confuſion. This diſcerning Power is above the Capacity of any particular Organ of Senſe; for each of theſe is intent upon his own Buſineſs; and whatever his Fellows do, is out of His Sphere; he knows nothing at all of the Matter; nor can he be a competent Judge in it.</p>

Each of Theſe is ſupreme within its own Territories; and a large Dominion each of them poſſeſſes: An infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53648:73"/>of Reflections and Notions ariſe from each; nor does any One of them hold under, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſtand in need of the reſt: Thus the Power of them all is equally abſolute, though ſome of them have a wider Range, and more Buſineſs, and a longer Train of Conſequences and Inſtructions, than ſome others. Nor are we to wonder at This, ſince the Caſe is the ſame in other Inſtances: For a Petty Prince is as independent, as truly Sovereign within his own ſmall Territories, as the greateſt Monarch upon Earth in Kingdoms of the largeſt extent.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is a Maxim univerſally receiv'd, <note place="margin">Their Number.</note> 
                        <hi>That there are but Five Senſes in Nature;</hi> and that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines all the World to think ſo, is, becauſe we can obſerve no more in our ſelves: But poſſibly there may be more, and ſome queſtion may be made of it; nay indeed ſome probable Reaſons may be offer'd, that there are more. But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that there are, it is certainly not in our Power to know it; nor can we poſſibly aſſert or deny the thing poſitively; For there is no way to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Want or Defect of a <hi>Senſe</hi> we never had. Several Brutes enjoy all the Advantages of Life that are neceſſary to them, notwithſtanding they do not enjoy all the Methods of Senſation, which Nature hath given to Mankind; and I ſee no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why an Animal may not ſubſiſt without any of the <hi>Five Senſes,</hi> that of <hi>Touch</hi> only excepted, which alone wou'd ſupply the bare Neceſſities of Life. It is plain we live very conveniently with <hi>Five;</hi> and yet perhaps there may be <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> more in Nature, which we in no degree partake of. But, as I ſaid, this is more than we do or can know; for each Senſe is conſin'd within its own Diviſion, and can make no Diſcoveties, nor hath any Juriſdiction out of its own Compaſs. A Man Blind from his Birth can never be brought
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53648:74"/>to any Idea of Sight; nor can he (ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) either deſire it, or be concern'd for the want of it. 'Tis true, he will tell you perhaps, that he wiſhes to <hi>See,</hi> but this is ſpoke by rote, and according as he hears other People expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for indeed he wiſhes he knows not what: And all it comes to at laſt is, that he wou'd be glad to have ſomewhat which he is told the reſt of the World have, and himſelf hath not. The reaſon of all This is, Becauſe the <hi>Senſes</hi> are the <hi>Doors,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See Note.</note> at which all our Knowledge makes its firſt Entrance; and that which did not begin, and is not let in that way, cannot come in at all. Thus a Man is not capable of forming to himſelf a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of more Senſes, than thoſe Five which himſelf hath, and conſequently cannot perſuade himſelf, that there are, or can be more in Nature; but it does not follow from hence that there can be no more, becauſe he hath no Notion of any more. Who knows whether the many Difficulties which ſtill remain unaccounted for in many of the Works of Nature, and the Operations of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that eſcape the niceſt Enquiry, and ſubtileſt Penetration of Humane Wit, may not be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Want of ſome Senſe, which we are not provided with to diſcern them? What the World uſually expreſſes by the Title of <hi>Sympathies, Antipathies,</hi> and <hi>Occult Qualities,</hi> may have ſome Senſitive Faculties in Nature, accommodated to perceive, and make a competent Judgment of them; and perhaps our Ignorance of them is owing to our being deſicient in this Point. Who can tell, whether it be not ſome particular <hi>Sixth Senſe,</hi> which informs the Cock, when it is Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and the firſt Dawning of the Day, and by ſome ſecret Impulſe, puts him conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Crowing at thoſe times? The ſame may be ſaid of that Direction, by which ſome Brutes are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53648:74"/>led to ſuch Herbs, as are proper for their Recovery, when ſick or ſurfeited; and of many other ſuch things as theſe, which are notorious Matters of Fact, but the reaſons of them perfectly unknown. This is a Caſe in which we are utterly in the Dark; and no Man can be poſitively aſſur'd on either ſide of the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Some indeed have undertaken to give a Reaſon for this particular Number of <hi>Five Senſes,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Whether enough of them.</note> and to prove that Theſe are ſuflicient, by comparing and diſtinguiſhing them, and the Uſes they ſerve. All <hi>Bodies</hi> (ſay they) without us, which are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Senſes, are either very near and cloſe to Our Body, or they are at ſome diſtance from it: If they be cloſe to us, and ſtill remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, then they fall under our <hi>Touch:</hi> If they approach, and come into us, then they are the Objects of our <hi>Taſte:</hi> If they are more remote, and ſtand before us, ſo that their Diſtances are meaſur'd by a Right Line, then the <hi>Sight</hi> diſcerns them: If the Line be Oblique, and the Motion Reflex, then the <hi>Hearing</hi> does it. Now methinks the Diſtinction were better thus: Of the <hi>Five Senſes</hi> accommodated for the Service of the whole Man, as he is compounded of Body and Soul, ſome are appropriated to the Uſe of the Body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and Theſe are the <hi>Touch</hi> and the <hi>Taſte;</hi> the One for all that enters within, the Other for that which continues ſtill without it. Some again are firſt and chiefly deſign'd for the Benefit of the Soul, and thoſe are <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing;</hi> the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to aſſiſt Invention, the Latter for Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Inſtruction, and all manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. And One more in the midſt of theſe Extremes, ſitted to thoſe Spirits and Avenues, that belong to Soul and Body both, which is <hi>Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Again, They anſwer to the <hi>Four Elements,</hi> and their reſpective Qualities; The <hi>Touch</hi> to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53648:75"/>
                        <hi>Earth; Hearing</hi> to the <hi>Air; Taſte</hi> to <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; Smelling</hi> to <hi>Fire;</hi> and <hi>Sight</hi> to a Compound of <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> becauſe of the Brightneſs of the Eye. It is likewiſe pretended, that there are as many Senſes, as there are General Diviſions of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects; and theſe are Colours, Sounds, Scents, Reliſhes, and a Fifth ſort, which wants a Name to expreſs it, adapted to the <hi>Touch,</hi> and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Tactile Qualities, as Hot, Cold, Hard, Soft, Rough, Smooth, Sharp, and the reſt of them. But This is evidently a Miſtake; for the Number of the Senſes is by no means adjuſted, according to the Number of the Objects they are capable of. Nor are theſe Objects the Cauſe of their being juſt ſo many, and no more. Were this a good Account, it wou'd follow, that we muſt have been endu'd with a great many more than we now have; whereas now one and the ſame Senſe entertains Objects of different Kinds; and one and the ſame Object creates a Perception, and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf upon ſeveral Senſes at once. The moſt probable Account of this Matter ſeems rather to be, That the Senſes were intended for Means and Inſtruments of conveying Knowledge to us; and that Nature, which, as ſhe is not niggardly, ſo neither is ſhe profuſe, hath given us as many Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as are ſuflicient for this purpoſe; and that when ſhe had ſupply'd us with enough for our Uſe, ſhe did not think ſit to give us any more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Of Theſe the Senſe of <hi>Seeing</hi> does ſurpaſs all the reſt in the Quickneſs of its Operation; <note place="margin">A Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of them.</note> For it reaches the very Heavens in an Inſtant, and acts in the Air, which is full of Light and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without any Trouble or Motion; whereas all the reſt of the Senſes receive their Impreſſion by the Motion of thoſe Bodies which make it. And all Motion requires Time to be perform'd in; ſo that all the other Senſes muſt needs proceed more
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53648:75"/>ſlowly than This, which need but open its Organ, and is ſure to find Light and Colours ſtand always ready to be diſcern'd by it. All the Senſes are likewiſe capable of Pleaſure and Pain; but This is obſervable of the two groſſeſt of them, That the <hi>Touch</hi> is capable of abundance of <hi>Pain,</hi> and but very little <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and the <hi>Taſte,</hi> juſt contrary, feels a great deal of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and little or no <hi>Pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of our Senſes is the Great Cauſe of our Ignorance, and Errour, <note place="margin">The Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them.</note> and all ſort of Miſapprehenſion: For, ſince <hi>Knowledge</hi> is attain'd by the Mediation of the <hi>Senſes</hi> only, if theſe make a falſe Report, what can we do but receive and ſtick to it? But after All, who can tell what Reports they make, or how can any Man accuſe them of Falſhood, ſince we learn all from Them, and conſequently even That which gives us this Jealouſie, and is the Ground of the Accuſation? Some indeed affirm, That the <hi>Senſes are faithful</hi> in all their Meſſages, and repreſent the very Truth; That, when we imagine they deceive us, the Fault is not in Them, but in ſomething elſe; and that we ought rather to lay it at any other Door; for no other thing is ſo free from, ſo incapable of impoſing upon us. Some again run into the contrary Extreme, cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Senſes as downright <hi>infamous Lyars,</hi> and tell you, that nothing at all of Certainty can be had from them.<note n="*" place="margin">See Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> But the Truth lies between theſe Extremes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now, Whether the Senſes themſelves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd or not, thus much at leaſt is evident, <note place="margin">The mutual Deceits of the Mind, and the Senſes.</note> that they put a Cheat, nay ſometimes a Conſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and that by an unhappy Viciſſitude, <hi>Reaſon</hi> pays them back in their own Coin, and returns the <hi>Cheat</hi> upon Them. And is not Man, think you, like to be wonderful Wiſe and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the outward and the inward Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53648:76"/>of Inſtruction are Eternally tricking one another, and his whole Compoſition is full of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Weakneſs in the moſt neceſſary and eſſential Parts of it? Now, that the Senſes deceive, and commit a Violence upon the Underſtanding, we ſee plain enough in thoſe Inſtances, where Some of them immediately put us in a Rage, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſweeten and appeaſe the Soul, and Others again tickle and pleaſe it exceedingly. And why ſhou'd Men turn their Heads away, when they are let Blood, or lanced, or ſuffer Inciſions and Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but from their Conſciouſneſs of the Power the Senſes have to <hi>diſturb</hi> their Reaſon; and that the ſame thing is better born, when the Eyes do not obſerve the Operation? The Looking down a Pit, or vaſt Precipice, diſorders and confounds a Man, though he knows at the ſame time, that he ſtands ſafe himſelf, and cannot reaſonably appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any danger of ſalling into it? And, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in no more, 'tis evident, that Senſe of Pain and Pleaſure both, does every Day vanquiſh, and utterly confound the beſt and braveſt Reſolutions of Virtue, and Temperance, and Patience.</p>
                     <p>Again, It is no leſs evident, that the Senſes on the other hand are cheated by the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> This is demonſtrated by thoſe Agitations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Love, and Hatred, and other Paſſions, which impoſe upon us, and make us ſee and hear things quite otherwiſe than they really are. Nay ſometimes our Senſes are not only deceived, but perfectly ſtupify'd, and bound up from all power of Action, by violent Diſorders of the Soul, as if the Soul retir'd inwards, and were entirely taken up there; For thus it often happens, when our Mind is very intent upon ſomewhat elſe, the Eye never ſees, nor takes the leaſt notice of thoſe Objects that ſtand directly before it, and preſent themſelves to our View. And Reaſon and Senſe judge very
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53648:76"/>differently of the Magnitude of the Sun and Stars, and of the Shape of a Stick in the Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Other Living Creatures have a Share in this Gift of Nature as well as We, <note place="margin">Theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are common to Men and Brutes.</note> and ſometimes are more liberally dealt with in it: For Some are quicker of Hearing than Men; Others have a ſtronger and clearer Sight; Others a nicer Smell; and Others a more diſtinguiſhing Taſte. The general Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that a <hi>Stag</hi> excells all other Creatures in <hi>Hearing,</hi> an <hi>Eagle</hi> in <hi>Seeing,</hi> a <hi>Dog</hi> in <hi>Smelling,</hi> an <hi>Ape</hi> in <hi>Taſting,</hi> and a <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> in <hi>Feeling.</hi> But yet the Pre-eminence in this laſt hath been allow'd to <hi>Man;</hi> which is not much for our Credit, ſince This of all the Senſes is reckon'd the groſſeſt and moſt Brutal. In the mean while, this Reflexion upon what hath gone before, may not be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; That if the Senſes are the Means and Inſtruments of Knowledge, and Brutes have Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes too, nay frequently more acute and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than Ours, there may a fair Argument be drawn from hence, for Their partaking in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with us, as well as they partake of the Helps and Means that convey it to us.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> But though the Senſes be the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> yet are they not the <hi>only</hi> Inſtruments; <note place="margin">It is hard to truſt our Senſes.</note> much leſs are our own Senſes alone to be conſulted or depended upon in the Caſe: For if it happens that Brutes have from Their Senſes a Report dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which Ours make, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given upon that Evidence do conſequently diſagree with the Notions we form to our ſelves, (as in ſundry Inſtances 'tis plain it does happen) which of theſe two Teſtimonies ſhall we believe? Our <hi>Faſting-Spittle cleanſes</hi> and <hi>heals</hi> our own <hi>Wounds,</hi> and yet it <hi>kills a Serpent;</hi> Now from Two ſo different Effects, what Concluſion can be made concerning the true Nature of Humane Spittle? Shall we ſay that it is of a Drying and a Cleanſing,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53648:77"/>or of a Poyſonous and Killing Quality? To make any certain Determination of the Operations of Senſe, we ſhou'd do well, methinks, to agree with the Brutes, who have the ſame Faculties as well as We. But the leaſt that can poſſibly be requir'd in order to it, is That we ſhou'd be conſiſtent with our own ſelves, and that the ſame Judge, and the ſame Evidence ſhou'd always concur in the ſame Sentence. And yet even This we are not come to: Shut your Eye, and put your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon part of the Lid, and this Eye ſo preſs'd ſees things after another manner, than it does in the Natural and Common Poſture. Stop your Ear, and the Sound is vaſtly different from what it is in the ordinary Impreſſion: Theſe Diſſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces every Man, when he will, may make for himſelf. But ſome there are which Nature hath made to our Hand: A Child Taſtes, and Hears, and Sees much otherwiſe than a Grown Man; and a Man in his full Strength diſlers no leſs from an Old Man; One in perfect Health, from a ſick Perſon; a Wiſe Man from a Fool. Now where the Diverſity and Diſtance is ſo great, nay, where there is even a Contrariety of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, where ſhall we fix, or what can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon for Truth? Even One Senſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and gives the Lye to another; for a Piece of <hi>Painting</hi> which ſeems Raiſed, and in <hi>Relief</hi> (as they term it) to the Eye, when we come to feel it with the Hand, is perfectly flat and ſmooth.</p>

                        <p>I. <hi>As to the Evidence of Senſe;</hi> This is what all Mankind, who have ever allow'd any thing of Knowledge or Certainty at all, conſtantly look'd upon, as the ſureſt and moſt irrefragable in all thoſe Caſes, which are the proper Objects of it: And therefore He that went about to evacuate or weaken this, was eſteem'd a Man not fit to be diſputed with: Becauſe one muſt needs deſpair of producing any better and more convincing Proofs, and ſo he muſt continue in incurable Ignorance, unleſs we cou'd ſuppoſe ſo abſurd a Proceſs in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, as that a Man ſhou'd be perſuaded of a thing more manifeſt, by a <hi>Medium</hi> which is leſs ſo. It were an Aſſront to Humane Nature, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the eſtabliſhing this by Arguments, ſince none ever diſclaim'd the Truth of it, but They who wou'd not allow us to be ſure that any Thing was true; and conſequently, cou'd no more depend upon their own Objections againſt it, than they cou'd upon the Thing they brought them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Therefore <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath very deſervedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Folly of ſuch perverſe Scepticks, in his <hi>Fourth Book.</hi>

                        <p>So that upon theſe Terms, it is evident all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt be given up, becauſe if our Senſes be falſe, we can have no ſtronger Conviction than what ariſes from Them, that any thing is true; nor that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> in the World. But beſides, if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to argue in ſuch a Caſe, any reaſonable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wou'd find no difficulty in the Belief of this Matter; For if he only allow the <hi>Being of a God,</hi> and conſiders the mighty conſequence of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to us in all our Affairs whatſoever; it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into one's Head, that a Being of ſuch Perfections wou'd leave his Creatures in perpetual Ignorance and Uncertainty, and give them ſuch Organs and Inſtruments, as ſhou'd only deceive and confound them: For God indeed is the true Efficient Cauſe of all our Senſations, and the Foundation of our Certainty; and his Goodneſs and Truth are our Pledges, that we are not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53648:78"/>ſtaken, and always in the wrong, in the due Uſe of thoſe Faculties he hath given us to diſtinguiſh things by.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again:</hi> If we obſerve the manner how theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations are perform'd, that it is by External Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, by which the Object ſtrikes upon the proper Organ, and that Impreſſion is continu'd till it be carry'd on to that, which is called the <hi>Common Senſory,</hi> or the inward Seat of Senſe; All this muſt depend upon the ſame neceſſary Laws of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> by which <hi>Bodies</hi> in general act upon one another. And therefore, ſuppoſing the ſame Object, the ſame force of Impreſſion, the ſame Situation, the ſame Diſpoſition of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the ſame <hi>Medium,</hi> and the like; the Report of the Senſe cannot but be the ſame: But where there is a Variation in any of theſe, the Perception is under a neceſſity of Varying too. Thus, (to uſe the Inſtance mention'd by <hi>Charron</hi>) When part of the Eye-Lid is preſs'd down by the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Rays are differently admitted into the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, and fall upon two ſeveral places of the <hi>Tunica Retina,</hi> which conſequently creates a twofold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Object: And This Duplicity is as natural and neceſſary in ſuch a Diſpoſition of the Eye, as truly agreeable to all the Rules of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> as a ſingle Repreſentation wou'd be in the uſual Poſture; ſo far from a Reflexion upon the Truth of Senſe, that our Senſes could not be true, if the thing were otherwiſe repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A proportionable Difference muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the different Modifications of Light and Shades; (which is the Reaſon of that Appearance taken notice of here, of Pieces in <hi>Relief</hi>) the dextrous Management whereof makes the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the <hi>Art of Painting.</hi> So it is again, if there be any thing uncommon in the <hi>Medium</hi> through which the Rays paſs from the Object to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53648:79"/>of Senſe; which is the Caſe of Priſmes, or of Eyes, either diſtorted in their Situation, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd in any of the Humours: And as Theſe make a Change in the repreſented Colour of the Object, ſo does the Contraction or Dilatation of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, in the Magnitude or Figure of it. And the Eye, and other Organs of Senſe, varying by Age, Sickneſs, Nature, or Accidents, unavoidably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire different Senſations, in Perſons of different Years and Conditions. The Matter coming much to one, whether the Object be variouſly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through Diſtance, or its own Poſture and Form, or through ſome Change and Defect of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, which receives the Impreſſion. All Which ſufficiently accounts for the differing Senſations of Children, Grown-Men, and Aged Perſons; the different Taſtes of the Sick and the Healthful; and indeed the vaſt Diverſity of Palats among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general: For here is a mighty Diverſity in the Organ of Senſe; and the making one and the ſame Report is therefore impoſſible: For our Senſes are like Meſſengers, and all their Buſineſs is, To be Faithful and True in delivering their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, as they have receiv'd it. If it were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it ought to be at firſt, (that is, if there be any accidental Defects to change the Appearance) This they are not reſponſible for; but they are to tell what they feel, and hear, and ſee; and in This they are faithful, and may be depended upon. For, That they may be truſted even in Matters of the greateſt Conſequence, is beyond all reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Contradiction; not only from the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and important Matters of Humane Life, being carry'd on upon the Confidence of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, but (which to a Chriſtian is much more conſiderable) from all the External Evidences of <hi>Religion</hi> being put upon this Iſſue. The Life and Death, the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53648:79"/>Bleſſed Saviour, the Doctrines he taught, and the Miracles he did in Confirmation of them, being ſo many Appeals to the Senſes of thoſe with whom he convers'd, and the great Motive to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, which the Apoſtle urges, is, that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd That to his Proſelytes concerning the Word of Life, of which they had had all poſſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, ſince it was what He and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Preachers <hi>had heard, what they had ſeen with their Eyes, what they had looked upon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 John I. 1.</note> and their <hi>Hands had handled.</hi> All which was certainly a very weak and impertinent Allegation, if the Senſes are ſo liable to Miſtakes, and ſo uncertain a Foundation of Knowledge, that we cannot with ſafety fix any Concluſions from the Reports they make to us. And yet it cannot be deny'd, but Men do very frequently err by too eaſie a Credulity in this reſpect, which miniſters ſufficient ground for our Second Enquiry.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi>Whence thoſe Errours do really proceed, which we find ſometimes charged upon the Deceiveableneſs of our Senſes.</hi> In This, as well as ſome Other Particulars, <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſeems to have been very unfairly dealt withal by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and ſome other Philoſophers of a contrary Party; who, becauſe he aſſerted the Truth of the Senſes, and vindicated their Fidelity in Reporting, have charg'd him with affirming, that a Man cou'd not poſſibly miſtake in forming Judgments according to thoſe Appearances. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Truth <hi>Epicurus</hi> only places the Senſes in the Quality of Evidence, whoſe buſineſs it is to relate bare Matter of Fact, but does by no means deny the Juriſdiction of the Court to which thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are given, to paſs Sentence as ſhall ſeem juſt and equal. To this purpoſe is that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> in his Tenth Book menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> in his Comment upon it, ſo rationally enlarges upon. By which is meant,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53648:80"/>that Men ought to avoid Precipitation, and not raſhly pronounce, that things are in reality as they are repreſented; but calmly and ſlowly examine Circumſtances, and obſerve the Cauſes of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. Thus likewiſe <hi>Lucretius</hi> in his Fourth Book, after having inſtanc'd in ſeveral Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which, when ſtrictly enquir'd into, are found to differ from the Nature of the things themſelves, cloſes his Account with theſe very ſignificant Verſes,
<q xml:lang="lat">

                           </q> Which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader may take from Mr. <hi>Creech</hi> thus:
<q>
                              <l>Ten Thouſand ſuch appear, Ten Thouſand Fees</l>
                              <l>To Certainty of Senſe; and <hi>All</hi> oppoſe:</l>
                              <l>In vain. 'Tis Judgment, not the Senſe miſtakes,</l>
                              <l>Which <hi>fancy'd</hi> Things for <hi>real</hi> Objects takes.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>If then One Light appear to be Two, when the Eye-Lid is preſs'd; if a Square Building at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeem Round; if a Piece in Perſpective ſeem a Cloyſter or a Portico; a Man is not preſently to conclude that theſe are really ſuch; nor can he be excus'd if he do ſo. For Reaſon and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration wou'd convince him, that theſe Idea's muſt be ſo, and cou'd not be otherwiſe; That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Diſpoſition of the Eye muſt needs double the Image in the firſt Inſtance; That the Diſtance of the Object will naturally cut off the Angles, and render the Perception leſs diſtinct, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and that Shades artificially caſt, and ſome Strokes of the Pencil or Style bolder and ſtronger
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53648:80"/>than the reſt, will of neceſſity create Imaginary Protuberances, and imaginary Diſtances in the Laſt. What Courſe then ſhall one take to prevent Errours in theſe Caſes? In general; he muſt not be too haſty in giving Judgment, but bring theſe things to the Teſt. The Firſt muſt be viewed with his Eye in its uſual Form and Condition; the Second he muſt make nearer Approaches to, and view it cloſe at Hand: For the Third he may call in another Senſe to his Aſſiſtance; and if the Eye alone cannot, the Touch muſt ſet him right.</p>
                        <p>But to this <hi>Charron</hi> replyes, and not only He, but <hi>Lucretius,</hi> That no One Senſe can poſſibly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect another:
<q xml:lang="lat">

                           <q>
                              <l>What? Can the Ears convince the Eyes? Can Thoſe</l>
                              <l>Confute the Hand, the Palate, or the Noſe?</l>
                              <l>Tell them wherein they err, when e'er they miſs,</l>
                              <l>And give falſe Notices? Fond Fancy this!</l>
                              <l>For Each a proper Uſe and Power enjoys,</l>
                              <l>A proper Object every Senſe Employs.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But after all, What is the true Meaning of this Argument, and how much does it amount to? No more than this. That All the Senſes are not equally adapted to receive and diſtinguiſh all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Objects: that Each of them is equally Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in thoſe peculiar to it: And conſequently, the Eyes cannot correct the Ear in Sounds; nor the Ear the Noſe in Smells: But does it follow from hence, that when two, or more of theſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are joyned, they will not corroborate the Teſtimony, and give a firmer Aſſurance? or that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53648:81"/>Reaſon, which is the proper Judge may not ſift out the Truth by confronting theſe Evidences againſt one another? This is a Conſtruction whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreign to the Place, and to the Philoſopher's Deſign. And therefore (ſays <hi>Empiricus</hi>) <hi>as Phyſicians pronounce of a Diſeaſe not from One ſingle Symptom, but from the Concurrence of ſeveral; and a Fover is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, not only by the quickneſs of the Pulſe, but by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Heat, the Redneſs of the Complexion, the Height of the Water, the Exceſſive Thirſt, and other Characters known to the Skilful in that Art; So a doubting Philoſopher makes a Judgment of Truth, by the Co-incidence and good Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral Ideas compar'd together.</hi> And to the ſame Purpoſe, <hi>Macrobius</hi> hath deſcribed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſit for ſuch Caſes. If (ſays he) <hi>a Man ſees the Figure of an Apple at a Diſtance, it does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follow that this is a real Apple; becauſe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance may be form'd out of other Materials.<note place="margin">Saturn 7.14.</note> What then ſhall he do to ſatisfie himſelf? Let him put it to the Tryal of another Senſe, and judge of it by the Smell: But poſſibly it may have lain among Apples, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Scent: Then conſult the Touch, and examine the Weight of it: But perhaps the Cunning Artificer hath been very Nice in adjuſting this too; If ſo, let him have recourſe to the Taſt, and if he find the true Reliſh of an Apple; theſe concurring Evidences leave no reaſonable Doubt of its being really the very Fruit it at firſt ſeem'd to be.</hi> From hence it does not only appear, what Care ought to be taken in judging the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Senſe; but likewiſe, how it comes to paſs, that Men ſo often err upon this Occaſion. That it is meerly the Effect of Raſhneſs, and Negligence; and the determining more than we have Evidence for. For theſe Ideas, and Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions give us only the appearances, and external Accidents of things; and ſo long as we affirm them to Appear ſo to us, we are ſafe, and cannot Err. But if from theſe Accidents we ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53648:81"/>undertake to determine of their Subſtance and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: if we ſhall definitively ſay, They actually Are, what they Appear, our own Mind miſguides us; and the Fault lies not in the Evidence, which told us true; but in the Judge, who decides the Cauſe, without canvaſing the Witneſſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares That for Right and Truth, which was never pos'd before him.</p>
                        <p>My Reader will eaſily apply what hath been ſaid here (perhaps too tediouſly) to what our Author inſinuates of the mutual Cheat, in his ſixth <hi>Paragraph</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> For hence it is that our Pannick Fears, and other groundleſs and violent Paſſions of the Mind, grow to ſuch Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they run away with the Firſt Impreſſions, and never call in Reaſon, to calm and moderate the Diſorder of the Spirits; but are perfectly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the preſent Heat and Agitation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of examining, magnify the tormenting Ideas to themſelves. All which is in no Degree owing to the natural Defect, either of Senſe or Reaſon; but to ſtrength of Paſſion, and Neglect of ſuch timely Remedies, as Nature hath provided us with, if not wholly to prevent, yet at leaſt to abate, and ſoften, and reduce it to a convenient Temper.</p>

I proceed now to the laſt Enquiry, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all our Knowledge depend upon the Senſes, ſo as that we can know nothing but by Their Means.</hi> Here <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> forſakes me, and fiercely vindicates that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Opinion of ſome old Philoſophers, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come at the Underſtanding, except it paſs through ſome of the Senſes in its Way thither.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not aſſerted by thoſe who undertake to maintain that Opinion, that nothing more can be known by us, than what the Impreſſions of Senſe give us an immediate Perception of; but that we are inſtructed from Reflection as well as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53648:82"/>Senſation; ſo that, by abſtracting, enlarging, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe modifying our Ideas, we come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature of things; yet ſo as that we can underſtand nothing, except the Ideas of it are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd clearly and diſtinctly; either ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us the thing it ſelf; or ſo as to give us ſufficient Matter for Reflection to work upon, in raiſing freſh Ideas from it.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>I. Thus it is, that they pretend to anſwer the Argument commonly urged againſt them, from that very Power we find in our ſelves, and the common Exerciſe of it, to correct the Errors of Imagination. For if all <hi>Perceptions</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> were <hi>Corporeal Images</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily judge according to the Report of our Senſitive Organs; and ſo the Sun muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded no Bigger than he appears. No (ſay they) for the Mind knows very well, that Diſtance leſſens the Object to the Eye; and therefore reflecting agreeably to the Rules given in the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it pronounces the Sun vaſtly bigger than it ſeems. But ſtill, All this will not amount to thoſe Reaſons, which adjuſt its Magnitude, to be 160 times Bigger than the Earth. Or, if they would, yet Proportions and Diſtances are meer Reſpects, and ſuch as we can have no Corporeal Images of. Theſe then are the Effect of another Principle; and ſo is the Determinate Magnitude of this Body; for though Inlarging the Idea, and allowing for Diſtance, would create an Image vaſtly Bulky perhaps; yet this could not ſtate the Exact Dimenſions, nor form the Compariſon in ſuch Odds, between that Globe of Fire, and this of Earth.</item>
                           <item>II. Another Argument againſt all <hi>Knowledge</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>from the Senſes,</hi> is taken from Thoſe, which are commonly call'd the <hi>Reflex Acts of the Mind,</hi> ſuch as we perceive our Own Operations and Thoughts by: For all Ideas, which are intromitted by the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53648:82"/>Senſes, come from Material Objects, and ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſubject to the common Laws of Matter; one of which is, To act by Impulſe, and upon ſomething elſe, but not upon it ſelf. So that it is impoſſible for the Mind to have its own Image convey'd through the Organs of Senſe; and conſequently theſe ſorts of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by which it retires inward, and recollects, and views it ſelf; As they are undeniable in Fact, ſo are they in all Reaſon to be aſcribed to ſome other Power than <hi>Imagination;</hi> and ſuch as the Senſes and External Impreſſions have nothing to do in.</item>
                           <item>III. But though we ſhould allow, that the Mind (as ſome have contended, though they have not been able to prove it) can by Similitude, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and ſuch other Methods, form Ideas even of theſe things; yet what ſhall we ſay to the Caſe of <hi>Immaterial Subſtances?</hi> And that ſuch there are, a Reflection upon our own Souls, the Objects about which they are converſant, their ſeveral Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the Manner of them, very incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Matter and the Laws of Motion, will not ſuffer reaſoning People to Doubt. Now if all Knowledge be derived from our Senſes, it muſt proceed from ſuch Ideas as are drawn upon the Imagination, by Impreſſions upon the outward Organ, conveyed thither in the uſual Courſe and Method of Senſation; but theſe Impreſſions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made otherwiſe, than by <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and conſequently, either we can have no diſtinct Notion, no aſſurance of any Immaterial Subſtances; or elſe we may have ſome Knowledge which does not depend upon, nor accrew to us from our Senſes.</item>
                           <item>IV. At this Rate, neither can we have any Idea at all, of the Firſt and moſt perfect Being, God himſelf: For what Repreſentations can Senſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53648:83"/>give us? what Reflections can it help us to, of a Being Infinite and Eternal, Independent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from no other Cauſe; ſuch as hath the Properties of <hi>Self,</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Exiſtence</hi> inſeparable from the Notion of it? It is not the Image of an old Man, nor the multiplying of Years into a vaſt Duration, that will do the Buſineſs here; for ſtill the main Difficulty, of never Beginning, never End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Self-Origination, or <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> remains; and will for ever remain, not only incapable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſible Repreſentation, but a Contradiction to them all. And yet <hi>Reaſon</hi> aſſures us, That ſuch a Being, there certainly is; nay, that there needs muſt be; for without it, nothing could ever have been at all; but We muſt loſe our ſelves and all our Ideas in a Maze and infinite Circle of Cauſes; and ſhall never be able to account for the Exiſtence of any thing, which our Senſes are confeſt to repreſent to us, unleſs we admit of One thing, which it muſt be confeſt, they never can give us any ſort of Repreſentation of.</item>
                           <item>V. Once more. To come lower, and obſerve even Corporeal Subſtances themſelves. Such as we ſee, and feel, and converſe with every Moment. From ſuch as theſe it is that our Senſes are moved. But let us conſider, What it is that moves them; or how far we can be informed by ſuch Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Now it is granted on all Hands, that <hi>Senſe</hi> can only inſtruct us in the Modes and Accidents of Things; and yet All thinking Men muſt allow, that thoſe Accidents are not capable of ſubſiſting alone. So that we can learn this Way the Powers and Properties of things, but not the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus, while we are forced to make a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, between the Nature and Real Eſſence, and the Properties or Accidents inherent in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we muſt yield plainly, that all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſo far from depending upon <hi>Senſe,</hi> that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53648:83"/>we cannot know any one thing by it. Since eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Reaſon undeniably aſſures him, that there is ſomething more intimate and deep, which no Ideas can reach to; and without which thoſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Qualities, of which he hath any Idea, could not poſſibly ſubſiſt.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Upon the whole Matter it is certain, that there muſt be ſome common Notices and Principles, ſuch as evidence themſelves to every conſidering Mind, which do not only aſſiſt, but carry us beyond any ſenſible Ideas, or any Reflections they can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into: Concerning which, if my Reader de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more full ſatisfaction, and would ſee this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument illuſtrated at large, he will do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the incomparably Learned and Judicious Biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his late <hi>Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity.</hi> Chap. X.</p>
                        <p>I add only upon this Occaſion, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Reaſons are of good Force to prove, that the Humane Soul is of a more Noble Principle than <hi>Matter.</hi> For indeed, not only <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> is not to be ſolved upon other Terms. Of which the Modern Philoſophers were well aware; who, when they aſſerted the Souls of Brutes to be mere Matter, ſoon found an abſolute Neceſſity of affirming, that they were altogether void of Senſe too: For though the outward Impreſſion be made upon the Organ, yet it is a Reflex Act, which makes the Senſation, and informs the Patient of it. And ſuch Acts they have not been able to conceive, how <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould be capable of. Since it is the Property of one Body to Act upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but no Body can act upon it ſelf.</p>

As to the Organ, by which they are performed, it muſt be confeſt, that That of the <hi>Sight</hi> is admirable for its charming Form, and nice Compoſition; it is Beautiful, Lively, and Sparkling, made up of great Variety; its Parts Subtle, and Small; and their Humours mix'd to Aſtoniſhment, both for Uſe and Comelineſs. From whence that common Obſervation hath obtained, that the <hi>Eye</hi> is one of thoſe Parts, which Nature firſt begins to form, and finiſhes one of the laſt. Upon the ſame Account This is one of the tendereſt, and moſt delicate Parts about us: Subject to a vaſt Number of Diſeaſes and Infirmities. Phyſicians and Anatomiſts have reckoned no leſs than a Hundred and Twenty Indiſpoſitions incident to it. <hi>Speech</hi> is eſteem'd the next in Dignity, but <hi>Hearing</hi> makes ſome amends for the laſt and loweſt Place, by the many great Advantages belonging to it. <hi>Sight</hi> ſeems to be the moſt Neceſſary, and moſt Serviceable to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And this ſeems to be the Reaſon, why it is of greater Conſequence to Brutes, whoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are chiefly Corporeal, than Hearing can be: But <hi>Hearing</hi> ſeems to challenge the Preference, with Regard to the Advantages and Improvement of the Mind. <hi>Sight</hi> is principally Uſeful for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53648:84"/>for moſt things are diſcover'd by the help of this Senſe; but though it lays the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and gives the Hints, yet it brings nothing to Perfection. It is farther to be conſider'd, that Sight is capable of Perception in nothing but what is Corporeal, and it gives no Knowledge of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals. Individuals and Bodies are its proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and it cannot penetrate into theſe any deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Shell or Surface.

Accordingly, there have been many Inſtances of Great Men who have been blind, and yet ſingularly eminent for Wiſdom and Knowledge; and ſome of Perſons who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd themſelves of Sight, in order to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more exquiſite Philoſophers; but no one Example of either of theſe Kinds can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Deaf Perſons. This is the Gate by which we enter, and ſtorm the Caſtle; By This we bend the Mind to Good or Evil. So Profane Story tells us of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Queen, whoſe Chaſtity was preſerv'd by Muſick: And ſo Sacred Story relates, that <hi>Saul</hi>'s Evil-Spirit was charm'd by <hi>David</hi>'s Harp: and ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory obſerves, that <hi>Graechus</hi> the famous Orator ſweetned his Voice by the help

To all This I may add, that This Senſe is of great Uſe in the Dark, and when Men are aſleep, by giving them ſeaſonable Alarms, and awakening them to provide for their Defence and Preſervation.

Only we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that theſe Noble Effects have their firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Hearing; for Wiſdom muſt needs have been put into the Mind before it can be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53648:87"/>drawn out from thence. And accordingly we ſee that Perſons born Deaf, are conſtantly Dumb too. The firſt thing to be done is to furniſh this Houſe within, which is ordinarily done by Hearing; and then follows the diſtributing our Stores by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Speech: So that the Good and Evil of what we ſpeak, will depend upon the Good and Evil of what we hear: For ſuch as we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to receive, ſuch of neceſſity we muſt give back again: And therefore a Man ſhould above all things keep his Ears chaſte and unpolluted, and ſtop them againſt Vice and Indecency; for this ſort of Communication is exceeding infectious,<note place="margin">Book <hi>III.</hi> Chap. <hi>43.</hi>

                     <p>Now the Seat,<note place="margin">The Seat and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul.</note> or rather the Throne of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul, where it ſits and reigns Supreme, is not the Heart, (as was generally ſuppoſed before <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) but the Brain: For the Heart is not capable of Wiſdom, but is properly the Seat and Source of Vegetation. Now the Brain, which in Man much exceeds the Quantity aſſign'd to any other Creature, muſt be ſo contriv'd and diſpos'd, that the Reaſonable Soul may act freely; and in order hereunto, the Figure of it muſt be almoſt like that of a Ship; it muſt not be a perfect Round, it muſt not be too Great, nor too Little; though of the Two Extremes the Exceſs is much leſs to be found fault with, than the Defect: It muſt be compos'd of a delicate fluid Subſtance, of fine and ſubtle Parts, and theſe well joyn'd together, and all united without any Separation, or void Spaces throughout the whole. It hath Four ſmall Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53648:88"/>or Ventricles, Three of which lie forward in the middle, and are plac'd in a Collateral Line to one another: The Fourth lies behind theſe, toward the hinder part of the Head, and is ſingle by it ſelf. This is the Shop in which the Vital Spirits are firſt form'd and united, in order to the being afterwards converted into Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and then convey'd into the Three Cavities that lie forward: And theſe Animal Spirits are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments made uſe of by the Soul, for diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſeveral Functions, and exerciſing all her Faculties. Thoſe Faculties are likewiſe Three; the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>Memory,</hi> and the <hi>Imagination:</hi> And theſe are not exercis'd diſtinctly and apart, nor hath each of them a different Ventricle of the Brain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it; (which is all an old and vulgar Errour concerning them) but their Operations are alltogether, and in common. All the Three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties exert themſelves in all and every of the Three Cavities; ſomewhat like our Bodily Senſes, which are double, and have Two Organs, in each of which the ſame Senſe performs all its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions entire. From hence it comes to paſs, that a Man who is hurt or diſabled in Two of theſe Three Ventricles, (as one in a Palſie, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) does yet continue to have the uſe of all his Three Faculties: That is, He underſtands, and remembers, and forms Idea's ſtill, by virtue of that One Cavity, which the Diſeaſe hath not yet ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon. It is true, he does this more weakly, and every Operation of every kind is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than it was formerly, becauſe the Strength and Vigour of One is not equal to the united Force of Three: But yet it evidently follows from hence, that each Faculty hath not its Workhouſe in a diſtinct Apartment, and entire to it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for then, aſſoon as any of theſe Ventricles begins to be diſabled, that Faculty to which it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53648:89"/>belongs, muſt immediately ceaſe, and cou'd never more be exerted in any Degree at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Some Perſons have been of Opinion, <note place="margin">How far the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Soul is Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</note> that the <hi>Reaſonable Soul</hi> is not Organical; that is, that it can act ſeparately and independently, and hath no need of any Corporeal Inſtrument to aſſiſt it in the Diſcharge of its Functions. And this Notion they have been more fond of, becauſe they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it of conſequence for proving the <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul.</hi> Now without engaging in a vaſt and dark Labyrinth of Diſpute, about a Matter which we are incapable of knowing perfectly, this Queſtion may be brought to a ſhort Iſſue: For if we will but credit our own Eyes, and our own Experience, every Day gives us Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which overthrow this Opinion, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Contrary. It is certain that all Men have not equal Capacities, nor do they apprehend things, or argue upon them alike, but the Diſparity is very great and viſible between one Man and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. It is no leſs evident, that the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon changes, and differs from himſelf; that his Reaſon is more clear, and perfect, and ſtrong at one Time, and at one Age, in one Diſpoſition of Body, and in one Circumſtance of Fortune and Life, than it is in another. One Man can do nothing except he have Eaſe and Leiſure; another requires Dangers and Difficulties to rouze him, and never thinks to purpoſe, till he be preſt hard, and driven to Extremities: A Third finds himſelf much more capable in Health than in Sickneſs: And a Fourth feels his Mind moſt vigorous and active, then when his Diſeaſes and Weakneſs have reduc'd his Body loweſt. The ſame Man at one Seaſon excels in Judgment, and flags in his Fancy; ſo that One Faculty decays in proportion as Another improves. Now the moſt probable Account that can be given for all theſe Differences and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53648:89"/>ſeems to be a difference in the State and Diſpoſition of the Organs, which are to the Soul as Tools to the Artificer. Which way but this ſhall we anſwer for the ſtrange Effects we ſee produc'd by Drunkenneſs, by the Bite of a Mad Dog, by a high Fever, by a Blow upon the Head, by the Vapours that riſe from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and annoy the Brain; and by ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents which affect any of the Parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts? What Confuſions do they make, how perfectly ſtupid, and childiſh, and frantick do Men grow upon them, loſe their Memory quite, and feel their Heads turn'd upſide down, their former Idea's eraced, their Judgment deſtroy'd? All the Wiſdom of <hi>Greece</hi> is not able to maintain it ſelf againſt them; and if the Shock be very violent indeed, then it does not only diſturb and enfeeble, but quite drive away the Soul, and conſtrain her to remove out of the Body. Now it is plain, that theſe Accidents are purely Corporeal, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they cannot affect what is not ſo; they can never fly ſo high as the exalted and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faculties of the Reaſonable Soul; all that they can do is to vitiate the Organs, to put Them out of their Courſe, and intercept the uſual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; and when This is once effected, the Soul can no longer act regularly; She may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but They cannot obey; and if theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are ſore bruiſed, and diſtorted very grievouſly, then She and They can no longer ſubſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Lodging is no longer ſit to entertain her, and ſhe muſt be gone.</p>
                     <p>Now I do by no means ſee, how this Opinion can be guilty of any Prejudice to that of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul;</hi> For firſt, We are not here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what the Soul is, but how ſhe operates, and what Laws of Action ſhe is bound up to, while in Conjunction with a Mortal Body. And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53648:90"/>Secondly, The making Uſe of Corporeal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, does by no Means prove the Uſer to be Corporeal or Mortal. God, without all Queſtion, is Immortal, and yet God himſelf does not think it below him to uſe ſuch; and to proportion the Effects and Operations of his Providence to them. He produces Men of different Underſtandings and Parts, according to the Conſtitution of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the Concurrence of other Natural Cauſes; nay, even according to the different Climate, and Country, and Air they are born in. For <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have ever been obſerv'd to produce Men of quicker, and clearer Wit, than <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Tartary.</hi> And as God does in this Caſe, ſo does the Mind in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It reaſons better or worſe, remembers more or leſs Faithfully, hath a more fruitful, or more barren Imagination, according as the Organs (which are the Corporeal Inſtruments appointed to ſerve it upon theſe Occaſions) are better or worſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to do their Duty. Now the Brain is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Inſtrument of the Reaſonable Soul, and therefore upon the due Temperament of This, a great deal muſt needs, indeed the Whole in a manner, will depend: That therefore ſhall be the next Thing we attempt to give an Account of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> By this <hi>Temperament</hi> is to be underſtood the Mixture and Proportion of the <hi>Four</hi> Prime <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Brain.</note> 
                        <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold, Moiſt</hi> and <hi>Dry;</hi> or rather a <hi>Fifth Quality,</hi> which is, as it were, a Harmony reſulting from a due Conjunction of all theſe together, like that Concord in Sounds, which ariſes from a Friendly Complication of different Notes. Now upon that Mixture of the Brain it is, that the State and the Operations of the Reaſonable Soul depend. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly This is Man's great Unhappineſs, that the <hi>Three Faculties, Underſtanding, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> do each of them require different, nay, contrary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, for their Exerciſe and Perfection. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53648:90"/>
                        <hi>Temperament</hi> proper for the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominance of Dry; and this gives us ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how it comes to paſs, that Perſons far gone in Years, are more Intelligent and Judicious, than thoſe that are Younger. For, beſides the Advantages which Art, and Study, and Experience may give them; they have a Diſpoſition to it from Nature; The Brain, as Men grow older, purifying it ſelf from Excrementitious Humours, and growing dryer every Day: For the ſame Reaſon, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Melancholy Perſons, and thoſe under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and Want, and Perſons that are faſting (it being an Effect of Grief and Faſting to keep the Brain dry) may be better diſpoſed to think; and qualified to do it to good Purpoſe, as well as ſome of them are neceſſitated by their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to apply themſelves to it. This is farther obſervable in Brutes; Ants, and Bees, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, as they are the Dryeſt, ſo they are the moſt capable, and ingenious of any; and thoſe of a moiſt Conſtitution, (the Swine for Inſtance) are Stupid and Senſeleſs. Thus again in Men; Thoſe of Southerly Countries, excel in Wiſdom, from the Drought of their Brain, and their inward Heat being moderated, by that of a Violent Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, which exhales it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temperament</hi> beſt accommodated to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> is <hi>Moiſt;</hi> and hence it is, that Children are more ready and perfect in it, than old People; hence it is moſt apt and faithful in a Morning, when the Brain hath been well refreſhed, and throughly moiſtned by a good Nights Sleep; hence alſo the Inhabitants of the <hi>Northern</hi> Climates, have the ſtrongeſt Memories, for Theſe are under a moiſter Air, by Means of their great Diſtance from the Sun. But this Moiſture muſt not be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken as if I meant, that the Temper of the Memory is fluid, like Water; but rather ſuch a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53648:91"/>Moiſture as we may obſerve in Air, Glew, Greaſe, or Oyl; ſomething of ſuch a Subſtance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of Parts, as may both take the Impreſſion eaſily, and keep it a great while; as we ſee Pictures do, that are laid in Oyl Colours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temperament</hi> ſitteſt for the <hi>Imagination,</hi> is <hi>Hot,</hi> which makes Diſtracted, Hair-brain'd, and Feveriſh People, excel all others in bold and lofty Flights of Fancy. Thus <hi>Poetry, Divination,</hi> and all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon <hi>Imagination,</hi> were always thought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſort of Fury and Inſpiration. This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is for the ſame Reaſon moſt Vigorous in Youth and the Flower of our Age: The Poets according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flouriſhed at theſe Years, and Almighty God, (who even in Supernatural Influences and Effects, made great uſe of Natural Cauſes, and did as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Violence as was poſſible, to a Courſe of his own Inſtituting) ordered the Matter ſo, that moſt of the Prophets ſhould do ſo too. The ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds likewiſe for thoſe Middle Regions, and more Moderate Climates, between the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>South,</hi> where Men are obſerv'd to excel in thoſe Arts and Sciences, which are derived from the Strength and Sprightlineſs of Fancy.</p>
                     <p>Now, from this great inequality of theſe Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Proportions, it frequently happens, that a Man may be tolerably well to paſs in all theſe Three Faculties, and not arrive at an Excellence in any one of them; as alſo, That a Man may be conſpicuous, and exceeding well Accompliſh'd in one of theſe Reſpects, and yet very Wanting and Deſpicable in the other Two. It is manifeſt, the <hi>Temperaments</hi> adapted for the <hi>Memory,</hi> and the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> are the moſt Diſtant and Contrary in the World; for what can be more ſo than, <hi>Moiſt</hi> and <hi>Dry?</hi> That of the <hi>Imagination</hi> does not ſeem ſo remote from the Reſt, for <hi>Hot</hi> will agree well enough with <hi>Moiſt</hi> or <hi>Dry,</hi> and is far from being
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53648:91"/>Incompatible with either; and yet, though theſe ſeem ſo conſiſtent in Nature, we ſee them very ſeldom reconcil'd in Fact; For thoſe who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed moſt Excellent in <hi>Imagination,</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found very Weak both in Point of <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and thought near a Kin to Fools or Mad-Men. The Reaſon whereof may poſſibly be This. That the <hi>Heat,</hi> which feeds and exalts their <hi>Imagination,</hi> waſts and exhauſts that <hi>Moiſture,</hi> with which the <hi>Memory</hi> is aſſiſted; and alſo the fineſt and moſt volatile of Thoſe Spirits, of which that <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> Partakes, which is ſerviceable to the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> and the Faculty, when deſtitute of theſe, grows flat and heavy. So that in Effect This is an Enemy to both the other Temperaments, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews it to be Deſtructive of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> From all that hath been ſaid we may plainly ſee, that the Principal <hi>Temperaments,</hi> which ſerve, <note place="margin">But Three of them.</note> aſſiſt, and ſet the reaſonable Soul on working, and which diſtinguiſh the Excellencies of the Mind, according to its Faculties, are <hi>Three,</hi> and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that Number. For <hi>Cold</hi> which is the <hi>Fourth,</hi> is of no ſignificance at all; <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> and <hi>Dry</hi> only, can contribute to Mens Ingenuity. The Other is a ſluggiſh, unactive Principle, and, inſtead of quickening, does only benumb and ſtupifie the Soul, and put a Stop to all its Motions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when in reading ſome Authors, we find them recommending <hi>Cold,</hi> as of uſe to the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and ſaying, that Men of a Cold Brain, ſuch as thoſe of Melancholy Complexions, or under the Southern Climes, are Prudent, Wiſe, Ingenious and the like; we muſt not there underſtand the Word <hi>Cold</hi> in its Natural and moſt received Senſe, but interpret it of a large Abatement and more moderate Degree of <hi>Heat</hi> only. For nothing can be more oppoſite to <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, than that Exceſs of <hi>Heat,</hi> which yet to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53648:92"/>the bettering of the Imagination, and refining the Fancy would be of great Importance. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the three Temperaments, of the Brain, there are three correſponding Faculties of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul. But both the One, and the Other of theſe admit of ſeveral Degrees; and may be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſubdivided, and diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Principal Offices, to be diſcharged by the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> and the different Qualifications of Men, <note place="margin">The Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided.</note> with regard to it, are <hi>Three;</hi> To <hi>conclude tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> To <hi>diſtinguiſh nicely,</hi> and To <hi>chooſe wiſely.</hi> The Sciences that fall properly under this Faculty, are School-Divinity; The Speculative Part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Logick, Natural and Moral Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Memory</hi> hath likewiſe Three Qualities to be diſtinguiſhed by. For there is <hi>One ſort of Memory,</hi> which eaſily receives Impreſſions, and eaſily loſes them again. A <hi>Second,</hi> which quickly remembers, and ſeldom or never forgets; and a <hi>Third,</hi> where the Impreſſion is hard to be made, and yet is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently worn out again. The Sciences proper to this Faculty are Grammar, and the Theory of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, Dogmatical Divinity, Coſmography, and Arithmetick.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Imagination</hi> abounds in Diſtinctions, and Differences are occaſioned by it, much more than either the <hi>Memory</hi> or the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is capable of. To this belong, after a more peculiar manner, Fanciful Inventions, Pleaſant Conceits, Witty Jeſts, Sharp Reflections, Ingenious Repartees; Fictions and Fables, Figures and Compariſons, Propriety and Purity of Expreſſion; and in a Word, All that Quaintneſs, and Elegance, and Eaſineſs, which adorns Converſation, and becomes the Character of a Man of Senſe, and Good Breeding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may range under this Diviſion, Poetry, Eloquence, Muſick, Correſpondence, Harmony, and Proportion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Now, from hence it appears, that Sprightlineſs, <note place="margin">The Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</note> Subtilty, Readineſs of Parts, and all that which commonly goes by the Name of <hi>Wit,</hi> is to be imputed to the <hi>Warmth of Imagination. Solidity, Mature Judgment,</hi> and Truth to the <hi>Dryneſs of the Underſtanding.</hi> The <hi>Imagination</hi> is Active, and Blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering, and Buſy; keeps all about it awake, and ſets the other Faculties on work. The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is a grave, ſedate, and ſevere Action; The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> acts not at all, but is purely Paſſive; and the manner of theſe Operations, ſeems to be thus. In the Firſt Place, the <hi>Imagination</hi> collects together the Idea's and Figures of Things, not only ſuch as are preſent by the conveyance and miniſtry of the five Senſes; but thoſe that are abſent too, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Inward and Common Receptacle, called the <hi>Senſorium commune,</hi> where the Forms of them lie depoſited. The Next thing in Order is to repreſent theſe to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> (if that be thought fit) and then this Faculty takes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſideration; examines, digeſts, and makes a Judgment of them. When That is over, the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> lays them up carefully to be preſerved in the <hi>Memory;</hi> (as a Man takes down a Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in his Table-Book) that ſo they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and made uſe of again, when any future Occaſion ſhall call for them. Or if the <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be not ſo diſpoſed, then ſhe commits theſe things into the <hi>Memory's</hi> Cuſtody, without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> at all, and ſo the Second Branch of this Operation is wholly Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded. Now this Account informs us, that the Acts of Recollection, Repreſenting to the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Faculty, laying up in the Memory, and drawing out thoſe Stores again for Uſe, are all of them Operations of the Imaginative Faculty. So that That <hi>Common Repoſitory,</hi> the Internal Senſe, (<hi>Reminiſcence,</hi> as it is called) and Fancy, come
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53648:93"/>within the Compaſs of This, and are not (as ſome pretend) Powers of the Mind, diſtinct and ſeparate from it. And conſequently there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thoſe Operations, that ſhou'd oblige us to quit the former Diviſion, or allow more Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Reaſonable Soul, than the Three al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inſiſted upon.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The Common People, who (to give them their due) are very ſeldom in the right, have an high Eſteem, <note place="margin">The Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and make a marvellous to do with <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> extolling This inſinitely above the other Two; The only Reaſon whereof ſeems to be, that this hath more of Shew, is more pretending and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and makes a greater Noiſe in Converſation. Hence it is, that a Man whoſe Memory is well ſtored, is uſually reputed a great Scholar; and that to pronounce one a Perſon of good Parts, you look no farther than his having a good Memory; as if <hi>Learning</hi> were to be preferr'd before <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which indeed comes infinitely ſhort of it; and this Faculty from whence it is furniſh'd, is the leaſt valuable of all the Three; For it is conſiſtent with great Folly, and inſufferable Impertinence; and very rarely to be met with in any great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, where the Perſon excels in Underſtanding and Wiſdom; for the Temperaments indeed from whence they reſult, are contrary to one another. From this vulgar Errour, I ſuppoſe the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Methods of teaching Children, to have taken their Riſe; it being the Cuſtom of Country-Schools almoſt every where, to follow them cloſe with Tasks to be got by Heart (as they call it) that ſo they may be able to repeat, and quote things readily out of Books. Thus they ſtuff their Memories full, and load them with the Riches of other Men, without taking any care to awaken and whet the Underſtanding; to form or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Judgment: Which, after all, is the moſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53648:93"/>neceſſary part of Inſtruction, to ſhew them the true worth of their Natural Faculties, to draw out the Stores and Abilities of their own Mind, and by the Exerciſe and Improvement of their Home-Growth, to render them conſiderate, and wiſe, and qualify'd for all manner of Buſineſs. Accordingly we ſee, that many of your Scholars, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in their Heads, are mere <hi>Prigs</hi> and <hi>Puts,</hi> and incapable of any management at all; and, that, (generally ſpeaking) the World is led by the Noſe, and all the weightieſt Affairs of Governments entruſted with Men of little or no Learning. Which yet no doubt is of infinite Advantage, and wou'd render even the prudenteſt and cunningeſt Politicians, yet more capable than they are, if wiſely inſtill'd, and well us'd. But then they muſt not (as the way of the World is) value themſelves upon Other Men's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor think it their Own, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it; but make it ſo, by digeſting what they read, incorporating it with their own Thoughts, refining and improving upon it, and knowing how to convert it to the Uſe and Benefit of themſelves and others. But to return; All Wiſe Men have given the Preference to the <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be the moſt excellent and choiceſt Piece of Furniture belonging to the Mind. If this moves right, all the reſt goes true, and the Man is wiſe; and if this be falſe, the whole Movement is out of Courſe. <hi>Imagination</hi> is the Second in Dignity; and <hi>Memory</hi> is the Laſt and Loweſt.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The following Similitude may perhaps contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething to our apprehending the true State of theſe Faculties, and the different Circumſtances and Relations they are in, more perfectly. <note place="margin">An Image of the Three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</note> The <hi>Reaſonable Soul</hi> then cannot be more painted to the Life, than by forming an Idea of it to our ſelves, as a Court of Judicature. Now in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53648:94"/>ſuch <hi>Court</hi> there are <hi>Three Degrees</hi> and Orders of Perſons concern'd: The Uppermoſt and moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Order is the <hi>Bench of Judges;</hi> and here there is little or no Noiſe, but a World of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſpatch: For they proceed calmly and quietly; and without any Hurry or Paſſion, try Cauſes, decide Controverſies and Claims, make Decrees, and give the Final Determination to all Matters brought before them: This carries a very lively reſemblance to the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which is the higheſt, the moſt honourable, and the judging Faculty of the Soul. The <hi>Second</hi> is the <hi>Bar,</hi> where the Council and the Attorneys are plac'd; and here is a world of Clutter, and Bawling, and Noiſe, but nothing done; for they can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to an Iſſue; They make no Orders nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, pronounce no Sentences: All Their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is only to diſcuſs Matters, to plead the Cauſe, and to lay it before the Judge. This is a lively Picture of the <hi>Imagination,</hi> which is a loud, a bluſtering, and a reſtleſs Faculty; never lies ſtill, not even then, when the Soul ſeems perfectly bound up in the profoundeſt Sleep; but is eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buzzing about the Brain, like a boyling Pot; and this can never ſix, or come to a peremptory Reſolution in any thing. The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is that of the <hi>Notaries,</hi> and <hi>Regiſters,</hi> and <hi>Clerks;</hi> where there is neither Noiſe nor Action: It is no part of their Concern which way things go; they are purely Paſſive; and all they have to do, is to make Entries of what paſſes in Court, and to take Care that the Records be faithfully kept, and ready to be produc'd upon occaſion. This gives us no ill Idea of the <hi>Memory,</hi> and its Office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The <hi>Action</hi> or Employment of the Soul is <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and this is of Univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For the Mind is a Houſe open to every
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53648:94"/>Gueſt; a Subject ready to receive any Impreſſion. As the Philoſophers ſay the Primitive Matter is diſpoſed to be moulded into any Forms; or as a Looking-Glaſs receives and reflects all Faces; ſo this Soul is capable of conſidering all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, be they Viſible or Inviſible, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals or Particulars; Objects of Senſe or not, the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is in at All. But (if we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to argue from the vaſt, and almoſt infinite Diverſity of Opinions, and the ſtill growing Doubts upon this Matter) it is acquainted with it ſelf the leaſt of any thing. This Knowledge is but dim and indirect: It is attained by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only, and the Knowledge of other things brought home, and apply'd to it ſelf: By which it feels, that it does underſtand, and thence infers a Power and Capacity of this kind. This ſeems to be the Method, by which our Minds attain to the Knowledge of Themſelves. Almighty God, who is the Sovereign Mind, knows Himſelf firſt, and all things elſe in Himſelf: But Man, who is the laſt and loweſt of all the Intellectual World, inverts that Order quite, and diſcerns other things before he can come to any Knowledge of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for His Mind is in Contemplation of Other Objects, (like the Eye in a Looking-Glaſs) which cannot work upon it ſelf without the help of a <hi>Medium,</hi> and ſees nothing at Home, while the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is continu'd in a ſtreight Line, but can do it by Reflection only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> But the great Difficulty to be enquir'd into upon this occaſion, <note place="margin">The manner of it.</note> concerns the Manner of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and by what Method the Soul attains to the Knowledge of Things. The moſt receiv'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is that deriv'd from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> importing, That the Mind underſtands and is inſtructed by the Senſes: That it is naturally and of it ſelf, a perfect Blank, a clean White Paper; and that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53648:95"/>whatever is written in it afterwards, muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by the Senſes, and cannot be convey'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other way.</p>
                     <p>But firſt of all, This is far from being Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true; for, (as was hinted before, and the Point referred hither for a farther Diſquiſition) there have been great Authorities of Philoſophers, that the firſt Seeds of all Sciences, and Vertues, and neceſſary Knowledge, are originally ſown in our Minds, and grafted there by Nature; ſo that Men may if they pleaſe, live very comfortably, and grow Rich out of their own Stock; and, provided they take but a little care to cultivate and cheriſh the kindly Beginnings, the Harveſt will not fail to be plentiful, and abundantly to reward their Pains.</p>
                     <p>Again; That Opinion ſeems highly injurious to God and Nature, and taxes them with unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Partiality: For upon theſe Terms the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul is more ſparingly dealt with, and left in a much worſe Condition, than either the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, or Senſitive, or any other Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: For all Theſe, as hath already been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, exerciſe their Functions readily, and are ſufficiently inſtructed by their own Native Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all things neceſſary for their Purpoſe. Thus Beaſts apprehend ſeveral Things without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and the Diſcipline of Senſe: They make Inferences, ſo far as their Caſe requires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Univerſals from Particulars: From the ſight of One Man they know the Humane Shape where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſee it again;<note place="margin">See Adv. upon Chap. <hi>XXIV.</hi>
                        </note> they are forewarn'd to avoid Dangers, even while inviſible; and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after That which is agreeable and beneficial to Themſelves, and their Young: And wou'd it not be a Reproach, or ſcandalous Blunder and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in Nature, if this Noble, this Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, ſhou'd have no Proviſion at all of its own,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53648:95"/>but ſent about a begging, and depend for mere Neceſſaries upon ſo mean, ſo frail Relief, as what the Senſes are able to give?</p>
                     <p>Once more; How can we perceive that the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> ſhou'd go to School to the <hi>Senſes,</hi> and be taught by Them, who are not able to teach themſelves? What precious Maſters are theſe, whoſe utmoſt Knowledge goes no deeper than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Accidents and Outſides of Things? For, as to the Natures, Forms, and real Eſſences of them, they know nothing at all of the Matter. And if This be the Caſe of <hi>Individual</hi> Subſtances, much leſs are they capable of penetrating into <hi>Univerſals,</hi> the dark and profound Myſteries of Nature, and all thoſe things which do not affect the Senſe at all.</p>
                     <p>Beſides; If all <hi>Knowledge</hi> were deriv'd from the <hi>Senſes,</hi> the Conſequence of this (one would think) ſhou'd be, That They, whoſe Senſes are the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſtrongeſt, and moſt diſcerning, wou'd always be the Perſons moſt conſpicuous for Ingenuity, and Learning, and Skill in Reaſoning. But we frequently ſee it happen juſt contrary; that ſuch People are the dulleſt, moſt ſtupid, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all others. Nay, ſome Perſons have thought their Bodily Senſes rather an Obſtruction than any Advantage to their Improvement: And upon that Account have wilfully depriv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of them, that ſo the Soul might be more expedite and free, and do her Buſineſs without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, when the Avocations and Diſturbance of Senſible Objects were taken out of the way.</p>
                     <p>Now if this Matter be as I have repreſented it; you will ask perhaps, Why theſe things are not always perform'd by the Soul, and why not by every Man alike? What hinders that all ſhould not be equally Wiſe and Knowing; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why it ſhou'd lie dormant, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduc'd into act; Or, if it do act, how comes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53648:96"/>it to paſs that its Operations are not always equal, that it goes about its Duty feebly, and performs its Functions much more lamely and imperfectly at one Seaſon than at another? This is the Caſe even of the Wiſeſt and moſt Capable Perſons; and ſome are ſo miſerably ſtupid, that the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Soul</hi> ſeems never to exert it ſelf at all. Where it does, the <hi>Vegetative Soul</hi> is vigorous and active in Youth, and very weak in Old Age: It is then decay'd, and ſpent, and cannot repair the Loſſes of Nature, (thoſe of Teeth eſpecially.) Which yet it does with the greateſt Eaſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in Children and Young People. The <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul,</hi> quite contrary, is evidently weaker in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and Youth, and cannot exert it ſelf then, as it does afterwards in riper Years, and old Age: This alſo performs ſome ſort of Actions in ſome ſorts of Diſtempers, which it hath not power to do in time of perfect Health: and Others again there are perform'd in time of Health, which it is utterly incapacitated for, when the Body labours under a Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe Objections are inſufficient: For, Firſt of all, They who hold the Opinion I am now contending for, never pretend, that the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>Power of Underſtanding is communicated to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man in equal Proportions.</hi> They admit a very great Inequality; from whence that Ancient and Noble Aphoriſm became ſo uſual in the Mouth of Philoſophers, That <hi>the acting Intellect is given to very few;</hi> and this very Inequality they make uſe of, as an Argument to prove that <hi>Science</hi> does not proceed from <hi>Senſe;</hi> ſince it is very manifeſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what hath been urged already, that They who are moſt advantageouſly provided for in point of Senſe, are oftentimes leaſt ſo in point of Learning and Wiſdom.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53648:96"/>
                     <p> As to the Second part of the Objection, That theſe Functions are not always perform'd alike; The true Reaſon of this is certainly, The different Condition of thoſe Inſtruments, which the Soul hath abſolute occaſion for, and conſtantly works by; for Theſe neither are, nor can be at all times in the ſame Order and Diſpoſition. Sometimes they are diſturbed ſo as to be fit for no Buſineſs at all: And when they are not put out of their Courſe, by any accidental Interruption, yet, even in their Natural State, they are not qualify'd for all Buſineſs alike; nay they act in perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, and croſs, and interfere with one another. To expreſs this now in as few Words, and as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the thing will bear:</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Temperament of the Brain,</hi> which you have heard ſo much of already, is the next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Inſtrument, by which the Soul is aſſiſted and determin'd in her Actings. Now This is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing various and mutable; and at thoſe Seaſons when it ſerves well for one Function of the Soul, it obſtructs and runs counter to another. In <hi>Youth</hi> it is <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Moiſt;</hi> and this Complication is extremely proper for ſtrengthening the Vegetative Faculty; but it keeps the Rational one Weak and Low. On the other hand it is <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Dry</hi> in <hi>Aged People;</hi> and This is a convenient Temper for the Reaſonable Soul, but highly prejudicial, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the Vegetative. When this Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Brain is ſoundly heated and refin'd by a high Fever, it is then accommodated to the Imaginative Faculty, and does Wonders in Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fancy; but this very Condition diſables the Intellectual Faculty, and is the moſt oppoſite that can be, to <hi>Mature Deliberation,</hi> and ſound Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Judgment.</p>
                     <p>It is no part of my Intention, by all this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to defraud the <hi>Senſes</hi> of any part of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53648:97"/>Commendation, which is their juſt due; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevent their ingroſſing All, and aſſuming more than their due. 'Tis confeſs'd, that the <hi>Mind</hi> reaps great Advantage, and is very conveniently ſerved by the <hi>Senſes;</hi> eſpecially in the beginning of its Contemplations, the firſt Hints and Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Invention and new Diſcoveries of Things. But ſtill we affirm, in vindication of the Mind's juſt Rights, that it does not depend upon the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes entirely; that it is capable of Knowledge and Underſtanding; can reaſon and diſcuſs Matters, infer and conclude, without the Senſes: Whereas, on the contrary, all Knowledge proceeds from the Mind; and the Senſes, when left to themſelves, cannot make the leaſt Progreſs, nor have one ſingle Perception without it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> It is farther obſervable, that the <hi>Mind</hi> proceeds in different Methods, and makes regular and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Advances in the Conſideration of Things. Sometimes it proceeds by the Addition and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Idea's: As firſt it conceives a <hi>Lion</hi> ſimply and directly, without attending to any of his Qualities: Then it adds the Idea of <hi>Strength</hi> to the former; and ſo having from ſome Effects had reaſon to believe that theſe will agree well together, and be true of each other, it concludes, that the <hi>Lion</hi> is <hi>Strong.</hi> This is what they call the <hi>Affirmative</hi> way of Arguing. Sometimes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by the Diviſion of Idea's, which is what they term the <hi>Negative</hi> way. Thus it underſtands the <hi>Hare</hi> to be <hi>Fearful;</hi> for obſerving her to run away and hide her ſelf, it concludes from this Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Behaviour, that a <hi>Hare</hi> is not <hi>Stout.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again we come to the Knowledge of things by Similitude, and the help of Compariſon; and of Others by a Collection of ſeveral Idea's, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating and Amplifying theſe as we ſee fit. Other Methods there are, which need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53648:97"/>in particularly, becauſe any Man, from his own Obſervation, and what hath been already deliver'd here, may eaſily repreſent the manner of them to himſelf.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> The End of all this anxious Purſuit is two-fold; That which is more general,<note place="margin">Truth, its End, but not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> and more natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is <hi>Truth:</hi> For of all the Deſires that we feel our ſelves moved with, there is not any of them more cloſely interwoven with our Nature, than the Deſire of <hi>Truth:</hi> It is with great Eagerneſs and Diligence that we try all the Means capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of leading us to the Knowledge of it; but alas! our utmoſt Attempts are ſhort and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for Abſolute Certainty is not a Prize allotted to us; nor does it condeſcend to be taken, and poſſeſſed by any the moſt aſſiduous Humane Soul. <hi>Truth lodges in the Boſom of God;</hi> there is its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and proper Apartment; Men underſtand not any thing in its utmoſt Perfection; <hi>We know in part,</hi> and <hi>here we ſee through a Glaſs darkly,</hi> ſays the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Truth.

If at any time it happens that a Man in the ſtudy of Nature fixes upon Truth, This is more by a lucky Hit than otherwiſe; and his good Fortune is to be extoll'd as much as his Induſtry; and when he hath it, 'tis odds if he can keep it; for many times a Man ſuffers it to be wreſted out of his Hands again by Sophiſms, and Deluſions, and contrary Appearances, for want of being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Point, and able to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood, and Reality from the Counterfeit. Errours are entertain'd by the ſame way that Truth is; the Paſſage by which both enter our Souls, is one and the ſame; The Methods made uſe of for diſcovering it, are <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> And both Theſe are extremely weak and defective, floating and uncertain, hard to fix, and changeable upon every ſlight occaſion, when we think they are ſixed. The great Argument of Truth is That of <hi>Univerſal Conſent.</hi> But what will all this amount to, when a Man hath conſider'd, what a vaſt Majority of Fools there are, and how very few Wiſe Men in the World? And again,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53648:105"/>To any one that obſerves how Opinions ſpread, and become general: Men take them from one another, as they do <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> by <hi>Infection:</hi> And <hi>Applauſe</hi> is that Breath that corrupts the Air, and bears about the Venom: This Applauſe again is given commonly blindly and inconſiderately, by them who never examine into the true Merits of the Cauſe; and by them too, who if they do pretend to examine, are not capable of judging in the Caſe. And thus, when ſome few have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Dance, the reſt have nothing to do but to fall in with the Tune, and follow them that lead it up of Courſe.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The other End aim'd at by the Mind, is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Invention.</note> which if it have leſs of Nature, yet hath more of Ambition and bold Pretenſion in it: This is aſpir'd to, as its higheſt Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that which makes moſt Shew to the World, and contributes moſt to its Reputation; That which it looks big with, and thinks the livelieſt Image of the Divine Nature: It is this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accompliſhment, to which all thoſe noble Works have owed their Original, which have fill'd the World with Tranſport and Wonder. And thoſe that have been of Publick Uſe among them, have even Deify'd their Authors, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliz'd their Names. What Renown have ſome gain'd, that were mere Curioſities, only for being eminent in their Kind, though no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſit at all accrued to Mankind by their means? Such as <hi>Zeuxis</hi>'s Vine, <hi>Apelles</hi>'s <hi>Venus, Memnon</hi>'s Statue, the <hi>Coloſſe</hi> at <hi>Rhodes, Archytas</hi>'s Wooden Pigeon, the Sphere of <hi>Sapores</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and infinite others. Now the Excellence of Art and Invention ſeems to conſiſt not only in a good I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Nature, but in outdoing it. This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens in particular Inſtances; for no Man nor Beaſt ſeems ever to have been ſo exquiſitely
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53648:105"/>formed in all its Parts, nor the Proportions of any one and the ſame Body, to have met together of Nature's Compoſition, ſo exact as theſe Artiſts have delineated, and repreſented them in Their Pieces. There are likewiſe ſeveral <hi>Improvements</hi> and Exaltations of <hi>Nature,</hi> in producing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding thoſe things by <hi>Art,</hi> which Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone never produces. This is plain from the Mixtures of Simples and Ingredients, which is the proper Buſineſs for Art to exerciſe it ſelf in; the Extraction of Spirits and Oyls, and Diſtillation of Waters, and compounding of Medicines more refin'd, more powerful and efficacious, than any Nature furniſhes us with. And yet after all, Theſe things are not ſo wonderful, nor do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Humane Wiſdom and Induſtry ſo highly, as the generality of the World are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: For, if we will paſs that Judgment in this Matter, which is agreeable to Truth and Duty, and pay a juſt Deference and Acknowledgment to the Firſt Author, Theſe are but <hi>Imitations,</hi> and not properly <hi>Inventions;</hi> They are Improvements, but they only promote and perfect what God hath firſt revealed. And what we commonly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and extol as our own Original Contrivance, is nothing more than obſerving the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, arguing and concluding from what we find there, and then reducing thoſe Obſervations into Practice. Thus <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Optiques</hi> were firſt rude and imperfect Hints, taken from Shades; and the Perfection they are now in, conſiſts only in a due, and proper, and beautiful Mixture of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which makes thoſe Shades. The <hi>Art of Dyalling</hi> comes from the Shadows caſt by Trees; and what they do in our Fields, we do upon our Planes; They are Nature's Meaſure of the Sun's Motion, and the Gnomon is Ours. <hi>Sculpture,</hi> and Engraving of Seals, and Characters, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53648:106"/>Cyphers, ſeems to be derived from the particular Marks, and Figures, and Emboſſings found in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. And if This be allowed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all our Boaſts is very poor; for it all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates here, That Man (in truth, and ſtrictly ſpeaking) hath invented nothing, but God and Nature give the Hints and firſt Draughts of all, and We improve, and by degrees refine upon them.</p>

For ſuch as theſe, we commonly find by experience, are more looſe in their Principles, more particular in their Opinions, more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and diſorderly in their Manners, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Men whatſoever. There are but very few of this Conſtitution, ſit to be left to their own Conduct; or who know how to manage their Abilities to their own Safety and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and how to let their Judgments run beyond the common eſtabliſh'd Opinions, without plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their Depth, and paying dear for their Raſhneſs.

Now ſome of theſe are purely Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, and fall upon it from outward Cauſes. Among which we may take Notice of Three more eſpecially.</p>

Sometimes the Subſtance of the Brain is not of a good Compoſition,<note place="margin">From the Body.</note> and ſo the Organs of the Soul are not in a Condition to do their Duty. And this again happens either from a Fault in the Firſt Formation, as in Them who have an Ill-ſhap'd Head, too little, or too round; or elſe from ſome accidental Hurts, afterwards, as many have ſuffered extremely in their Reaſon and Memory, by Falls, and Blows, and Wounds upon their Head.</p>

Or which is yet worſe, ſometimes wild and fantaſtical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions have been drunk in, and with theſe the Mind is ſo ſtrongly ſeaſoned, ſo groſſely cheated, that They are not only not diſmiſs'd, but made the Rule of our Judgments, and the Meaſure of Truth in other Caſes. All is brought to this Standard; and receiv'd or rejected, as it agrees or diſagrees with it. Here the Man ſixes his Foot, and will not be got one Step backward or forward. The Inſtances of this kind among the Vulgar are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; moſt of whom are guided by ſome fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Notion, ſome erroneous Conceit, that hath grown up, and is like to live and die with them. And indeed when theſe Fancies or Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are common, they are like a ſtrong Torrent; Every Body hath not Force and Vigour of Mind enough to ſtem it, and keep himſelf from being carried down the Stream with his Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>The Third,<note place="margin">Paſſions.</note> and That which ſticks much the cloſeſt to it of all the reſt, is the <hi>Sickneſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53648:109"/>of the Will,</hi> and the <hi>Inordinacy and Strength of the Paſſions.</hi> And in this Caſe, the Soul is a World turn'd upſide-down. The <hi>Will</hi> is made by Nature to follow the Directions of the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> This is its Guide to Inſtruct; Its Candle to give it Light; but when once the Strength of Paſſion hath corrupted, and as it were laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands upon the <hi>Will,</hi> then the <hi>Will,</hi> in like manner, corrupts, and commits a Violence upon the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> And from this diſorderly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure it is, that the greateſt Part of our falſe Judgments grow. Envy and Malice, and Love, and Hatred, and Fear, make us ſee things with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eyes; and take them for what they really are not; and draw ſuch Concluſions, and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from them, as they miniſter no Juſt Ground for. From whence it is, that we ſo often are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd, and do admoniſh others, <hi>to Judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paſſion.</hi> This puts us upon all thoſe baſe and black Interpretations, by which we labour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe the virtuous Behaviour, and generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other Men; Hence we ſtudy and invent Cauſes, and Intentions, for them, and, of our own Malice, aſſign vain and wicked Motives and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for what they do. This is a moſt abominable Vice, and an evident Proof of great Malignity in our Nature, and of a diſeaſed Mind; There is no great Matter of Wit or Judgment ſhewn in ſuch Proceedings, but they betray a World of Baſeneſs and Ill-Nature. For whence can all this Miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpring, but either from that Envy, which our Neighbours Honour and Reputation provokes in us; or from a meaſuring of others by our ſelves, and ſo taking that for granted in Them, which we are Conſcious of in our ſelves; or from a Weakneſs and Diſtemper in the Mind, which like ſome Sickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Body, alters and vitiates the Palate, confounds and blinds the Sight, that we neither
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53648:110"/>ſee nor taſte Things as they are; and that Virtue, in its native Purity and Luſtre, is too Strong for us to bear or conceive? From the ſame Cauſe it is, that we are ſo officiouſly Spightful, in publiſhing other Mens Vices and Failings; that we aggravate theſe beyond what they deſerve, but take good Care to extenuate their Virtues as much; hence from ſingle Actions, and particular Circumſtances, we draw general Inferences, and fix ſtanding Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters upon Men; Hence comes our Partiality in judging, and our Regards, not to the Thing, but the Perſon. If he be a Friend, or of Our Opinion, or in Our Intereſt; then all he does is juſtified or applauded, and every Thing becomes him; and his very Vices are Virtues; But if he be an Enemy, if he have diſoblig'd us Perſonally, or be engag'd in a Contrary Faction; he is ſtark naught, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is as it ſhould be. Thus we are content to wrong and diſgrace our Judgment, provided we may but gratify our Paſſions. But alas! we are not come to the End, nor to the worſt Part of it yet; For moſt of the Impieties, and Hereſies, the Errours in point of Belief, and Controverſies of all Sorts in Religion, if we examine them ſtrictly, and trace them up to their firſt Head, will appear to be ſo many noiſome Streams of this bitter Fountain; a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and wicked Will, inordinate Paſſion, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fual Pleaſure; which by Degrees bribes and debauches the Underſtanding, and wins it over to its own Side. <hi>The People ſat down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play;</hi> As the Scripture obſerves of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> very well to this purpoſe;<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53648:110"/>were committed with many Doubts, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and great Reluctancies, have not only out-worn all Scruple in time, but been aſſerted and maintained for Divine Truth, and Expreſs Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. What was at firſt in the Senſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite only, hath made its Way higher, and got the upper Hand of the Underſtanding; What was meerly Paſſion and Pleaſure, hath been advanced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Principle of Religion, and an Article of Faith. So dangerous a thing is it for any part of the Soul to be diſeaſed; So Strong the Infection, and ſo quickly does it ſpread from one Faculty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And thus you have had an Account, what thoſe Three Cauſes of Our Mental Defects, and the Errors in our Judgment are, which were ſaid to be external and foreign to the Mind it ſelf. For it appears, that the Underſtanding may be wanting or impaired, by Means of Sickneſs or Bodily Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, more eſpecially any Diſeaſe or Hurt in the Head, or any inconvenient Shape of the Skull. From the prejudicate Opinions of the World, and taking up groundleſs Whimſies for meaſur'd and certain Truths. And Laſtly, from any Diſorder in the other Faculties of the Rational Soul; which are plac'd below, and ought by Nature to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Governance of the Mind. Thoſe whoſe Failings proceed from the firſt of theſe Cauſes, deſerve our Pity, not our Cenſure or Blame; and of them ſome are curable, and others incurable. The Second are not wholly Innocent, but yet Faulty in ſuch a Degree, that we may pardon, and excuſe them. But the Third ſort are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guilty. They deſerve both Cenſure and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for ſuffering the Order of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ſo inverted, that thoſe which were born Subjects, and ought to ſubmit, ſhould uſurp the Throne, and preſume to give Laws to their Natural Sovereign.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> But, beſides theſe outward and accidental Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there are others,<note place="margin">Its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defects.</note> Natural and Internal, ſuch as take their firſt riſe from, and are born and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Mind it ſelf. The greateſt of All, and indeed the Source and Root of all the Reſt, is <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Preſumption.</hi> (The Firſt, and the Original Sin of Mankind, the Bane of every Soul, and the Cauſe of all manner of Evil) 'Tis This that puffs Men up with <hi>Sufficiency</hi> and <hi>Self-Satisfaction;</hi> This will not ſuffer us to yield to any body, or think others Wiſer or Better than our ſelves. This makes us deſpiſe the good Counſel of our Friends; and place an entire Confidence in our own Opinions. This calls the Judgments of other People into Queſtion; arraigns and condemns them; nay, ſometimes, ſuch as we underſtand nothing of, nor are capable of examining or comprehending the Reaſons of them. 'Tis moſt truly obſerv'd, that <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is not only the Beſt, but the Happieſt Portion God Almighty hath diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among Men. For tho' this Diſtribution be made with a very uneven Hand, yet no body thinks himſelf ſtinted or Ill dealt with; but he that hath never ſo little is contented in this Reſpect however, and thinks he hath a Child's Share at leaſt. Now This Diſtemper is owing to no Cauſe ſo much, as the want of being more intimately acquainted with our ſelves; for by this means we are Strangers to our Wants and Weakneſſes, and not at all ſenſible of our greateſt Misfortunes, So that the Root of all our Diſeaſes is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> not That which is oppoſed to Skill in Arts and Sciences, and converſing with the Writings of Learned Men; but Ignorance of our own Affairs and Condition, the Removal and Cure whereof was propoſed in the Beginning, as the Deſign of this whole Firſt Book.</p>

For both Reaſon and Experience tell us (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved formerly) that it is very poſſible and uſual, for a Man, who is Excellent in one of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to be wretchedly weak and wanting in the other. This indeed is a Faculty very Serviceable and Uſeful to Mankind; but it comes far ſhort of the <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and is much the Tendereſt, and moſt Feeble of all thoſe Parts, whereof the Rational Soul is compoſed.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE Power of <hi>Imagination</hi> is exceeding great; This is in Effect the very Thing,<note place="margin">The Effects of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> that makes all the Noiſe in the World: Almoſt all the Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Diſturbances we feel, or make, are owing to it. (Accordingly it was obſerv'd before, that This is, if not the <hi>Only,</hi> yet at leaſt the moſt <hi>active</hi> and buſtling <hi>Faculty</hi> of the Soul.) And, in good Truth, the Effects of it are Wonderful, Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and almoſt Incredible. For the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Imagination</hi> are not confined to the Body or the Mind of that Perſon alone, where it is born and cheriſhed; but extend and transfuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves far and wide, and act very Strongly upon other People. It is fitted for all manner of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the moſt diſtant and contrary Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are raiſed by it; It puts the Man into all manner of Forms, and the Face into all Colours and Complections: Makes Men bluſh with Shame, look Pale with Fear, tremble and quake, caſts them into Fits of Raving and Confuſion; Theſe, tho' ſtrange, are yet ſome of its leaſt Effects, and gentle in Compariſon of others. It checks and enfeebles Men in their hotteſt Career; balks their Pleaſures, and chills all their Spirits. It Marks and deforms, nay, ſometimes kills <hi>Embryo's</hi> in the Womb; haſtens Births, or cauſes Abortions; Takes away the Speech, and ties the Tongue; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enables the Dumb to ſpeak, as the Story of <hi>Croeſus</hi> his Son aſſures us. Makes Men Stiff and Motionleſs, benumbs and binds up the Senſes,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53648:112"/>ſtops the Breath; Theſe are its Effects upon the Body. Then for the Mind, It robs Men of their Knowledge and Judgment, turns them into Fools and ſtupid Sots; as <hi>Gallus Vibius</hi> for Inſtance, who having ſtrain'd his Imagination too far in the ſtudy and practice of Polly, and its Motions, is ſaid to have diſturb'd his Underſtanding to that Degree, that he turn'd a mere Natural, and cou'd never return to ſound Judgment and good Senſe again. It inſpires Men with ſtrange Preſages of things hidden and future, fills them with Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſms and Fancies, out of the common Road of Thinking; throws them into Extaſies and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; nay poſſeſſes them with the Thoughts and Expectations of Death, till at laſt they die indeed; as it did that Malefactor, who, when his Cap had been pull'd over his Eyes in order to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was found ſtark dead upon the Scaſſold, when they came to uncover him again, and read his Pardon. In a word, A great part of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Operations, which create ſuch Amazement in the Vulgar, Apparitions, and Viſions, and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, are to be attributed to the force of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and what They think done by the power of the Devil, or ſome familiar Spirits, (for I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not here with the Supernatural Operations of God's own Spirit) is commonly no more than a ſtrong Fancy, either in the Perſon that does theſe ſtrange things, or of the Spectators that are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them, and think they ſee thoſe Objects, which really they do not. And the great Care in theſe Caſes is, to diſtinguiſh wiſely between Truth and Falſhood, and not ſuffer our Judgments to be captivated with vulgar Errours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In this part of the Soul it is, that <hi>Opinion</hi> keeps its Reſidence, which is nothing elſe but a vain and eaſie, a crude and imperfect Judgment of things, taken up upon ſlight and inſufficient grounds;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53648:113"/>too credulous an Aſſent to the Repreſentations of our outward Senſes, or common Report, which reſts in the firſt Appearances of Things, and fixes in the Imaginative Faculty, without ever going farther, or referring the Matter to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be throughly examin'd, and digeſted there, and ſo wrought up, and finiſh'd into ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Till This be done, no true Judgment can be made, and ſuch as a Man may venture to abide by. And accordingly we ſee the other is mutable and inconſtant, fleeting and deceitful. A very dangerous Guide, that makes Head againſt Reaſon; of which it is only the Image and Shadow, and that but an empty and falſe one neither. This is the Source of all our Evils, our Confuſions and Diſorders, our Paſſions and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; the moſt, and the worſt of them riſe out of a prepoſſeſt Fancy, and heated Imagination: So that in truth Madmen and Fools, the Ignorant and the Mobb, are blindly led by the Noſe by it, and follow this Leader; and betray their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in doing ſo; as Wiſe and Judicious Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves, and approve their Prudence in ſuffering nothing but <hi>Reaſon</hi> to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That thus it is, <note place="margin">The World is govern'd by Opinion.</note> we ſee plainly; for, as hath been obſerv'd long ago by one of the Ancients, <hi>It is not the Reality, nor the true Nature of Things, but the Notion and Opinion Men entertain of them, that diſquiets, and ſo violently Torments their Souls</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Opinione ſaepius quam Re laboramus: plura ſunt quae nos terrent, quàm quae nos premunt.</note>. Thus we turn our own Executioners, form Evils to our ſelves which <hi>are not,</hi> and ſtrangely aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoſe that <hi>are,</hi> by frightful Idea's, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to them. The Truth and Eſſence of Things never enters our Minds in its true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53648:113"/>nor works upon us by its natural Force and Authority; for were it thus with us, all things that are alike in Themſelves wou'd be alike to Us; and the ſame Object wou'd produce the ſame Affections and Reſentments in all Men, allowing only ſome ſmall matter of difference in the Degree of them. At this rate all Mankind would be of the ſame Opinion: What is falſe wou'd be univerſally rejected, and what is true as univerſally embrac'd; for <hi>Truth</hi> can be but One and the Same; and is always equal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it ſelf. But quite contrary, We find that the Difference of Opinions is infinite; Men do not only vary from, but directly contradict one another. And there are but very few Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which even Men of the beſt Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and moſt eminent for their Improvements and acquir'd Learning, are all of a Mind. This ſhews ſufficiently, that the Idea's of things are compounded and mixt before we entertain them, that we have them at our Mercy, and put what Forms we pleaſe upon them; And, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they come to us in, is not what Nature gave, but what the Temper and Diſpoſition of our own Minds have moulded and modell'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. That which I firmly believe my ſelf, I cannot prevail with my Friend to believe; Thoſe are Arguments to Me, which to Him are none at all. Nay, which is more; Let one be never ſo confidently aſſur'd of a thing to Day, I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage that I ſhall continue in the ſame Opinion of it to Morrow: And it is odds I may, (and plain that I often do) entertain very different Notions of it, and be quite otherwiſe affected with it another time. So ſure it is, that Things have juſt that place in our Opinion and Eſteem, which we think fit to aſſign them; that they are reliſh'd juſt as our Palate ſtands at that time; and ſhew to us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53648:114"/>to thoſe Colours which we our ſelves have tinctur'd them with. Like the Eyes of Men in the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> or the <hi>Priſmes,</hi> that refract and vary the Rays that fall upon the Organs of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes, ſo does the Soul alter its Objects too; and the preſent Conſtitution of it is the <hi>Medium,</hi> through which they muſt paſs to us. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation with regard to Morals, may be apply'd to Speculation too,<note place="margin">Tit. I. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto the defiled is nothing pure.</hi> Thus our Thoughts are like our Clothes, that keep us warm, with a Heat which is none of their own, but ſuch as we firſt gave them, and they keep it; and at the ſame time that they receive our Warmth from within, they receive and keep the Cold of Froſt and Snow without. But ſtill the Warmth we feel is all our own; we firſt impart it to Them, and they in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital preſerve it for our Benefit, and pay what they received, back again to Us.</p>

We believe and act, we live and die upon Credit and Content; and our great Buſineſs is to conform our ſelves to Cuſtom, and to think and do like the reſt of the World, and according to what They, not our own Reaſon, eſteems moſt adviſeable. Thus <hi>Faſhions,</hi> and not <hi>Judgment,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Mankind; and perhaps indeed, for the greateſt part of Mankind, this is not much amiſs; for moſt People have not Wit enough to chooſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore ought to reſign the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Actions to others: But Wiſe Men are above theſe mean and ſervile Compliances; they have a better Rule to walk by than <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Example;</hi>

Again: This draws the whole Man after it, and carries him whitherſoever it ſelf is determin'd; for he that conquers the <hi>Will,</hi> hath ſubdu'd the Perſon. When the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is convinc'd, the Conqueſt is by no means entire; for the <hi>Will</hi> frequently holds out afterwards, and makes an obſtinate Defence againſt Reaſon and Sober Judgment. But when once This yields, All is ſurrendred, and the Man is not now any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his own Maſter, he hath from thenceforth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left that he can call his own. Once more; This is the very Thing that fixes our Character; It makes and it denominates Good or Ill Men: This gives our Temper and Complexion, and we appear to the World under its Colours and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. As of all Virtues and Qualifications of the Soul, <hi>Probity</hi> is the firſt and chief, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53648:115"/>more deſirable than Learning, or Parts: All that Nature, or Art, or Induſtry can give, are not comparable to it; ſo it muſt be confeſt, that the <hi>Will,</hi> which is the Seat and proper Reſidence of Virtue and Goodneſs, is infinitely the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Faculty that Humane Nature can boaſt of. A Man is neither Virtuous nor Vicious, Honeſt nor Diſhoneſt, for knowing what Virtue and Vice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Diſhoneſty are; tho' this Knowledge be never ſo nice and exact in the Speculation; but by his Inclination, and Love, and Practice of theſe things, by the Diſpoſition of his Mind, the Choice of his Heart, the Bent of his Affections, and the general Tendency of his Manners and Behaviour. There are indeed ſome other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences peculiar to the Underſtanding; it is as the Husband in the Family, and this as the Wife, which ought to be under its Governance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: That is the Guide, or as the Light, This as the Traveller, which ſhou'd follow its Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and walk by them: But ſtill the laſt Reſult of all depends upon the <hi>Will;</hi> This finiſhes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and determines the whole Matter; and in that reſpect the <hi>Will</hi> is ſuperiour even to the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The true and moſt remarkable Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Faculties, with regard to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Operation, ſeems to be This: That by the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> Objects come into the Soul, and are there receiv'd and entertain'd, as the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms by which the Offices proper to this Part, are uſually expreſſed, (ſuch as Apprehending, Conceiving, Comprehending, and the like) do plainly import. And here they make their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, not according to what they really are in their true Nature and full Proportions; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent Diſpoſition and Capacity of the Perſon, and in ſuch Meaſures only as he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53648:115"/>is able to receive them in. Thoſe Objects which are great and ſublime, are for this reaſon under a neceſſity of condeſcending and contracting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and come to us with conſiderable Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Defalcations; becauſe the Paſſage at which they enter is not large enough for their true Height and Bulk: Juſt as the <hi>Ocean</hi> flows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> not in ſuch Quantities as are agreeable to its own Fulneſs, but ſuch only as the <hi>Streight's Mouth</hi> can give admiſſion to. Now in the Operations of the <hi>Will,</hi> the Method is quite contrary; Here the Soul goes as it were out of it ſelf, it ſtretches and moves forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Object; it ſeeks and runs after it with open Arms, and is eager to take up its Reſidence, and dwell with the Thing deſired and beloved: Nay, it even transforms it ſelf into <hi>That,</hi> aſſumes its Name and its Nature, wears its Livery, and is diſtinguiſh'd by the Things it ſerves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to. Hence we give it the Title of a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> or <hi>Vicious,</hi> a Spiritual or a Carnal Mind; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it purſues commendable and exalted Objects, or is ſunk into Senſuality and Vice. Thus the true and only way by which the <hi>Will</hi> can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble it ſelf, is by loving and chooſing worthy and noble Things; and the abandoning it ſelf to little and low, baſe and unworthy ones, is the debaſing and diſparagement of it. So that our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Compariſon is in this regard juſtify'd again; for thus the <hi>Will</hi> is, as a Wife, who gets or loſes Quality, according to the Perſon ſhe marries; and in ſtrictneſs can claim no Honour, nor Place, but that which belongs to her Husband.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Daily Experience aſſures us, that there are <hi>Three Things</hi> which whet and ſtimulate the <hi>Will;</hi> The Difficulty of Obtaining; The Rarity or Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Thing we ſeek; and The Abſence, or Fear of Loſing it. And the Three Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53648:116"/>oppoſite to Theſe, which are, Its being Eaſie, and in our own Power; The Abundance or Commonneſs of it; and The Conſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Secure Enjoyment, do as much blunt and pall our <hi>Will.</hi> The Three former raiſe our Eſteem of any thing; the Three latter render it cheap, and beget Neglect and Contempt. We are alſo ſharpned, and made more eager by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Refuſal; and entertain ſome ſort of Indignation, which makes us more reſolute againſt any thing that pretends to ſtand in our way, and diſappoint our Deſires. And thus, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extreme, we diſdain and overlook the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we have in hand, though never ſo valuable; and loſe what we are already poſſeſt of, for things diſtant and in Reverſion; and in proportion, what we lawfully do or may enjoy, for ſuch as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or ought not.

                        <hi>PAſſion is a violent Motion of the Soul, in that which is diſtinguiſhed by the Name of Its Senſitive part:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An Account of Paſſion; what and whence it is</note> And the Cauſe and Tendency of this Motion is, either to purſue ſomewhat which the Soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends to be <hi>Good;</hi> or to decline, and run away from ſomething, which it apprehends to be <hi>Evil.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But it is very neceſſary, and of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon this Occaſion, to be rightly inform'd how theſe Motions begin, and what it is that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and kindles theſe Fires in us. Of This, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accounts may be given, and different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons made uſe of, to illuſtrate it by, according to the different Reſpects in which we conſider them. And firſt of all, with regard to the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs and vehemence of their Emotions, it is to be obſerv'd, That the Soul, which, however ſeemingly multiply'd by Diſtinctions, is really but One and the Same in the Body, hath ſeveral Powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it; and Theſe differ greatly in their Qualities and Operations, according as the ſeveral Veſſels in which the Soul keeps her Reſidence,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53648:117"/>and the Inſtruments ſhe makes uſe of in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Functions, and the Objects propounded to her Contemplation, are differently diſpos'd. Now when the Parts, where the Soul takes up her Lodging, are not crowded or over-burdened, but filled in ſuch Proportions as ſute well with their ordinary Cuſtom and Capacity, and ſuch as are convenient for a due diſcharge of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Duties, then all the Operations of the Soul are gentle and mild, ſedate and regular. But, on the other ſide, when any of theſe Parts are either put into a ſwifter and more violent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or are heated above their ordinary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Temper, then they immediately feel a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Change, to the great Prejudice and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Soul. The like we ſee in the Beams of the Sun, which, when ſcatter'd looſely with all that Freedom they naturally take in diffuſing themſelves, impart a moderate and gentle, a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and kindly Warmth; but when contracted within the Concave of a Burning-Glaſs, they burn up, and quite conſume the very things to which they gave Life and Nouriſhment before. It muſt be farther obſerv'd too, that Theſe Parts are not always diſtributed alike; And from hence ariſes another Diſtinction, not only with regard to the Kind and Quality, but to the Degree of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; and ſo they differ in the ſame ſort, as their Violence is greater or leſs. Thoſe Motions that are moderate, are capable of being reliſhed and digeſted; a Man knows what he feels, and is in a Condition of expreſſing his Reſentment in Words, or giving it Vent by Tears. But thoſe that are exceſſive and extreme, are too big, and too mighty. They ſtun and take away our Senſes quite, fill the Soul with Confuſion and Amazement, bind up, and quite overbear her Powers, and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her from acting.

Now upon ſuch a Conſtitution, and ſuch Orders duly obſerved, the Peace and Proſperity of the whole Kingdom will depend. But if theſe be neglected and broken, and put out of their proper Courſe; If the Magiſtrates, which go between, and are a ſort of Balance between King and People, ſhall ſuffer themſelves, either to be impoſed upon thro' Eaſineſs, or Credulity; or corrupted by Favour or Aſſection; or if they ſhall employ their Authority
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53648:118"/>in acting contrary to the Eſtabliſhed Laws, and Duties of their Places; or if they ſhall go beyond their Commiſſions, and come to a ſinal Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Cauſes, which they ought not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, without ever laying them before their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who hath reſerv'd the Hearing and Deciſion of all ſuch Matters to himſelf in Perſon: In all theſe Caſes, I ſay, the publick Peace is violated, the Eſtabliſhment infring'd, the Prerogative incroach'd upon, and nothing but Miſchief, and Miſery, and Confuſion can be the End of it. Now thus it is likewiſe in our <hi>Little World.</hi> The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Man;</hi> and under him is employed a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, whoſe Buſineſs it is to receive Idea's, and to make an Eſtimate of them; This is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magiſtrate, whoſe Office obliges him to examine, and to judge; The Evidence he goes upon, is that Report the Senſes make of all things repreſented to them; and according to this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the Judgment in conſequence of it, the Affections are by the ſame Faculty put forward, in order to execute this Sentence. For his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Governance in the Execution of this Office, our Judge in Commiſſion hath the Law, the Light of Nature, and Dictates of Reaſon to go by; and this, in ordinary Caſes, is ſufficient without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther Formality: But if it happen, that the Affair be of great Moment, or if any Difficulty ariſe, then he muſt have recourſe to, and know the Pleaſure of his Superiour; and in this Caſe the Underſtanding, which ſits Supreme, anſwers all Doubts and Points of Law, and expects to be conſulted and applied to for Orders and Advice. This is the Scheme of our Government and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and ſo long as Matters are thus managed, all is quiet and well. But it is our Great Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that this Imaginative Faculty, (which is under the Intellectual, but over the Senſitive, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53648:119"/>to whoſe Juriſdiction the firſt Examination and Judgment of things belong,) often ſuffers it ſelf to be bribed, corrupted, impoſed upon; And the Effect of this is, Firſt to paſs wrong and raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then to ſet the Affections at work to very ill Purpoſe; and at laſt to diſturb, and confound, and ruine All. Now ſeveral things there are, which may contribute towards the depraving, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this Power, in its Judgments and Operations: As firſt of all; The <hi>Senſes</hi> themſelves, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate into the Bottom, nor comprehend the Real Subſtance, and hidden Nature of Things, but the bare Surface, and next Appearance of them only: And Theſe make a Report to the Soul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their preſent Apprehenſion; ſet before it the outward Images only, and that, ſo as may gain them Favour and Recommendation, and pre-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it with a Character of their Qualities, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Satisfactions and Delights they are capable of adminiſtring to theſe Senſes in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and not upon the Conſiderations, how Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or how Advantagious they may prove to the whole Man in general. A Second Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which often confirms, and ſtrikes in upon the Neck of This, is the Falſe Notions, and Unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cry of the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> when we look upon our ſeives oblig'd to Approve and Diſapprove, as Others do; and when nothing is reputed needful to eſtabliſh an Opinion, more than its being Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular. From theſe two falſe Offices of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, The <hi>Report of our own Senſes,</hi> and the <hi>Voice of the People,</hi> proceeds a Raſh Inconſiderate Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Soul takes up of Things; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fair Tryal, or ſufficient Deliberation, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them, Good or Evil; Advantagious or Hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; fit to be courted, or fit to be deteſted and avoided. And this is without all Diſpute a very dangerous Guide; a very hot and haſty Miſtreſs;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53648:119"/>for as ſoon as ever we entertain it, without more ado it ſeizes upon the Imagination; and there ſtanding upon its Defence, ſtrengthens it ſelf as in a Caſtle, Mans all the Works, and holds it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Reaſon; then it comes down to the Heart, and there ſtirs and agitates the Affections, with the violent Reſentments of Hope and Fear, and Joy and Grief. In a Word, it is a perfect Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the State, looks out all the Fools, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in the Soul, and blows them up into Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; raiſes the <hi>Mobb,</hi> that is, the Paſſions, and ſets all in an Uproar and Confuſion. And all this by taking wrong Methods, going Headlong to work, and not ſubmitting the Matter to the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> as by the Nature of this Eſtabliſhment, and the Duty of its Station, that Faculty was obliged to do.</p>
                     <p>Permit me to ſet before you another Illuſtration of this Matter by a Compariſon taken from Military (as the former was an Alluſion to Civil) Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Senſes</hi> anſwer here both to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, whoſe Poſt it is to watch, and be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Guard, for the ſafety of the Soul; and alſo to Scouts, who are to look out, and ſcour the Country, and bring in Intelligence to the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> which is the Supreme <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> To qualify them for this Duty, They are endued with a Power, of perceiving things; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning and taking the Faces and Forms of them; and embracing or rejecting them, according as they appear Agreable or Diſagreable, Delightful or Odious to them. But now in the Execution of their Office, their Buſineſs is only to ſpy out, and to report; to take Care, that their Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be True, and to bring it Faithfully, and relate it Plainly and Calmly. And they ought to ſatisfy themſelves with delivering their Meſſage, without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them to diſturb the higher Powers, or to ſound to Arms immediately, and ſo put all into
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53648:120"/>Conſternation and univerſal Diſorder. And thus it often happens; that as the Centinels in an Army, may lie under Miſtakes, becauſe they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecret Deſigns of the General; and ſo receive Them for Friends, which are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Diſguiſe; and ſuſpect thoſe for Enemies, which are Allies, and marching to their Aſſiſtance; The <hi>Senſes,</hi> in like manner, not being privy to all that paſſes above, and for want of conſulting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Caſe, are frequently impoſed upon by counterfeit Appearances, and apt to take That for a Friend, which is, in truth, our deadly Enemy. And when they go giddily to work upon this Imagination, and without ever expecting Orders from the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> fall on immediately, and alarm the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> and <hi>Iraſcible</hi> Faculties; then they raiſe Tumults, and Mutinies in the Soul; and while theſe laſt, there is nothing but Clamour and Violence; the Voice of <hi>Reaſon</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard, nor the Commands of the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> be at all obeyed.</p>

Now we muſt know,<note place="margin">According to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Subject. Six in the Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part. Three for Good, and Three for Evil.</note> That all <hi>Paſſion</hi> whatſoever, is moved by the Appearance, either Real or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, of Good or Evil; what actually is, or what is by the Perſon apprehended ſo to be. If the Object be Good, and the Soul conſiders it as ſuch, ſimply, and without any other Circumſtances, this is that Motion of the Soul, which goes by the Name of <hi>Love.</hi> If to that Good, ſo conſidered as before, be added the Circumſtance of its being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the Man reflect upon himſelf, as in full Poſſeſſion and actual Enjoyment of it, This is call'd <hi>Joy,</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> but if it be future and diſtant, then it is <hi>Deſire.</hi> On the other Hand, conſider an Evil Object, abſtractedly, and merely as ſuch, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53648:120"/>the Paſſion it ſtirs in us, is <hi>Hatred:</hi> If it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and affect us ſenſibly, it is <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Pain;</hi> if ſome other Perſon labour under it, 'tis <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion;</hi> if it be future and approaching only, then 'tis <hi>Fear.</hi> And This is remarkable, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſions already named; that Thoſe of them, which proceed from the Apprehenſion, or the Appearance of Evil, ſuch as we run away from, and are poſſeſt with an Abhorrence of, do of all others ſink deepeſt into the Heart, take faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hold of us, and are moſt difficult to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſſeſt again. This now is the firſt Regiment of Mutineers, which diſturb the Content, and break the Peace of our Souls, and theſe are quarter'd in that which is term'd the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> Part. The Effects and Diſorderly Carriage of Theſe are, it muſt be confeſt, of very dangerous Conſequence; but yet they are not near ſo Outragious and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, as thoſe that we are going to mention. For theſe firſt Motions, formed here by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Object,<note place="margin">Five in the Iraſcible; Two for Good, and Three for Evil</note> are afterwards conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and communicated to the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> Part of the Soul, that is, The Place, where the Soul is active, and contriving Means to obtain what ſhe apprehends to be Good; and to deliver her ſelf from that which ſhe apprehends to be Evil. And then, as a Wheel already in Motion, when a freſh Force puſhes it, receives that Addition eaſily, and whirls about with wonderful Strength and Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo the Soul, which is already ſtirred and warmed with the firſt Apprehenſion, when a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Attempt is made upon it, and the Coals are blown, flames out, and is tranſported with Rage and Violence, much greater than before. The <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> Then raiſed, ride higher; are much more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ungovernable; for now indeed they are double: The firſt have come in and joyned them, and thus they back and ſuſtain one another, by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53648:121"/>this Union, and mutual Conſent. For the former Paſſions, which were the Reſult of Good or Evil in Appearance, conſidered in Speculation only, now fall in with the Practical Conſideration of Means proper for the acquiring or avoiding them, and ſo excite in us <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Deſpair.</hi> And here, thoſe that ariſe from the Proſpect of a future Evil, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us, either <hi>Fearfulneſs</hi> or <hi>Courage;</hi> the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a preſent Evil, kindles <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation;</hi> which are Paſſions extremely Furious and Violent, and ſuch, as when they find the <hi>Reaſon</hi> once diſturbed, confound and abſolutely overturn it. Theſe are the Principal Winds, that raiſe all the Storms in our Souls; and the Cavern (like that of <hi>Aeolus</hi>) where they are ingendred, and from whence they break looſe, is nothing elſe but <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> (And <hi>Opinion</hi> is moſt commonly a falſe, fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and uncertain Thing; contrary to Nature, and Truth, to Reaſon and Certainty) that is, A Notion we have, that the Things which are then repreſented to our Imaginations, are Good or Evil. Nor matters it much, how wild, and extravagant, this Notion is in it ſelf, provided We do but give it Entertainment. For Men proceed not upon Realities, but upon their own Fancies; and when once we have taken a Conceit that a Thing is Good or Evil, we run after, or we run away from it, with as much Eagerneſs and Impatience, as if it were actually ſuch; and yet it often, very often happens, that the Nature of the Object is directly contrary to our Apprehenſions, and ought to move Reſentments, juſt oppoſite to thoſe we feel upon its Account. And ſuch in general are our <hi>Paſſions.</hi>

It is naturally a gentle and pleaſing Paſſion, which with much Eaſe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into Great and Generous Spirits, and is not driven out again without great Difficulty. We all think it our Duty and Commendation,

And therefore all of us run full ſpeed, and put our ſelves upon the utmoſt Stretch, where This is the Prize. The Ambitious Man ſtrives to be firſt, keeps his Eye forward upon the Goal, and upon thoſe that have the Start of him; but forgets and takes no notice of the many he hath outſtript himſelf.

Nay even <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, which ſometimes pretends to diſpute the Point of Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, is yet miſerably vanquiſhed and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd over by it. <hi>Alexander, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> are ſo many Inſtances of this Obſervation; and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53648:124"/>ſo are abundance of great Generals beſides, who have refuſed to gratifie their Inclinations, upon extraordinary fine Women, when they had them at their Mercy: And all this from no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than a Point of <hi>Honour;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conquers all other</note> and a Soul enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with <hi>Ambition;</hi> to which the Fires of Love were ſo far from being equal, that they were made ſubſervient to it; and the Conqueſt of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires became a Triumph and a Sacrifice to their Glory. Thus it happen'd very remarkably in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> For no Man alive was ever more ſiercely addicted to Amours of all ſorts, than He, (as the many Extravagances he had been guilty of both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and abroad in Foreign Parts, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie) no Man was ever more choice of his Perſon, more nice in Dreſs, more careful to preſerve and render it agreeable to the Ladies; and yet <hi>Ambition</hi> was evermore his reigning Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Pleaſures of Love, tho' they had him in perfect Subjection, when This came not into Competition with them, were then ſo feeble, and ſo over-match'd, that they never cou'd prevail for the throwing away upon them ſo much as one Hour, which was capable of being employ'd, or made in any degree ſerviceable to the promoting his Honour. So that, notwithſtanding the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any other Paſſions, which had their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too; yet <hi>Ambition</hi> ſat Supreme in his Soul, and was, to all Intents and Purpoſes, as if It had had the ſole and ontire Poſſeſſion of him. 'Tis true, we meet with an Example, the very <hi>Reverſe</hi> of this, in <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and ſome Others, who have been ſo enſlaved by Love, as to give up All, baniſh their moſt neceſſary and weighty Cares, and loſe themſelves, and their Crowns, through mere Eſſeminacy and Neglect. But then theſe have been Perſons of quite different Tempers; For where both meet together, and are fairly weigh'd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53648:124"/>one againſt the other, <hi>Ambition</hi> will caſt the Scale. Some indeed, who argue for the force of <hi>Love</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, tell you, that in Reaſon it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe This extends to the Body as well as the Mind, keeps the whole Man in Captivity, and is not only agreeable, but neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient too. But I ſhou'd think, the Reaſon holds on the contrary ſide, and that <hi>Ambition</hi> is therefore the ſtronger, becauſe the more Spiritual Paſſion: What they pretend of the Body being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo concern'd in Love, proves the Paſſion to be ſo much the Feebler; for from hence it muſt by neceſſary conſequence, be capable of being ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cloy'd. Again; What is Corporeal it ſelf, admits of Corporeal Remedies and Cures, ſome which Nature provides, and others which Art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; and accordingly Experience hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe, and ſhewed Inſtances of many who have beaten down the hotteſt <hi>Flames of Love;</hi> and of ſome who have overcome and quenched theſe quite, by artificial Means, and good Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But now <hi>Ambition</hi> is ſo far from being glutted, that its Appetite is never ſatisfy'd.

When the Man is in Power, and too Big for Puniſhment, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; then, and not before, you ſee what he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is.

The Fiſh is not yet caught; but when it is, then he will come abroad, in his true Colours, and Natural Complexion; and though <hi>Ambition</hi> ſhould make ſo good Progreſs toward Virtue, as to quit all other Vices; yet there is but very little Hope or Appearance of its ever renouncing it ſelf. It puſhes Men to Brave and Illuſtrious Actions, I confeſs it; and the Benefit of theſe Actions to the Publick is unſpeakable; but though Others may reap the Fruit, and be the better for ſuch Actions, yet it will not follow, that the Perſon who does them is one whit the Better for them.

For, as That Ground where the Veins of this Metal are found, is Unprofitable for other Uſes; and neither Graſs, nor Plants, nor any other Thing, of Value and Service to Mankind, will grow there; it is in this Reſpect a moſt lively Emblem of the Minds of Men, which are enamour'd with it; They being, in like manner, the moſt ſordid, and abject, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53648:129"/>abandoned Wretches, curſed and condemned to Barrenneſs; void of all Honour, loſt to all Virue; and no kind of thing that is Good in it ſelf, or Beneficial to the World, is to be obtained, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them. What a horrible Degradation is this? and how do we leſſen and diſparage our ſelves, when we give up that Dominion and Liberty to which we were born, by becoming Servants and Slaves to the very meaneſt of our Subjects?<note n="*" place="bottom">Apud Sapientem Divitiae ſunt in Servitute, apud Stultum in Imperio.</note> For <hi>Riches</hi> (as is moſt truly obſerv'd) <hi>are the Wiſe Man's Servants, and the Fool's Maſters.</hi> And in Truth, the Covetous Man cannot be ſo properly ſaid to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs Wealth, as That may be ſaid to poſſeſs Him. He hath it indeed, but he hath it in ſuch a Senſe only, as he hath a Fever, or ſome violent Diſeaſe, which hath got an abſolute Maſtery over him, and preys upon his Vitals, and all his Faculties. How extravagant is it to dote upon That, which neither hath any Goodneſs of its own, nor was ever able to make any one Man Good ſince the beginning of the World? A thing that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> diſtributes Promiſcuouſly, and with a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Hand; ſcattered in common to all the World, and the greateſt Share, very often, permitted to the worſt and moſt ſcandalous Part of Mankind? Nor is this all. For, though the Thing be indifferent in its own Nature, and that ſingle Conſideration is ſufficient to wean, or at leaſt to moderate our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet the Effects and Conſequences of it are by no means indifferent, but in the Iſſue and Event, incline ſtrongly to the Worſe. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement of Mens Minds, and the depravation of their Manners, being the manifeſt and frequent Effect of it. And, though it cannot be proved, that <hi>Riches</hi> ever reform'd one ill Diſpoſition, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53648:130"/>made it Virtuous; yet there are innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Perſons otherwiſe well-diſpoſed, who have been corrupted, and made Vicious by their Means. And when we have computed all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that attend them, and repreſented theſe in their beſt Light, and to all poſſible Advantage; it muſt be acknowledged after all, that a great many wiſe Men have lived very Eaſy and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py without them; and a great many more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and naughty Men have died Scandalouſly for them. So then They are no <hi>neceſſary Ingredient</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and they expoſe us to Danger, and Diſgrace, and Death. In a Word, This is to act upon our ſelves the Barbarity and Tyranny, for which the cruel <hi>Mezentius</hi> was Infamous; to tie the living Body to the dead Carkaſs, that ſo it may languiſh, and expire with greater Torment; to mix a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Refined Spirit, with the Droſs and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Earth; to perplex and involve the Soul with innumerable Difficulties, and Tortures, which this Paſſion will be ſure to bring upon it; to entangle one's ſelf in the Snares of the Wicked one, and voluntarily to be taken Captive by the <hi>Adverſary of Souls,</hi> as the Scripture admirably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it.

There needs but little Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to convince us, that the uſing Riches as one ought, and getting an abſolute Dominion over them, is a Task much more laborious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, than the being content under the Want of them; and a Prudent and Virtuous Behaviour in Poverty, is more attainable than a ſteady Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the midſt of Plenty. In the former of theſe Circumſtances, a Man hath but One Attack to guard, and may bend all his Forces againſt That without Diſtraction; If he can but keep his Courage up from ſinking under the Affliction, and maintain his Ground with Conſtancy and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he hath done his Buſineſs effectually. But the <hi>Temptations of Wealth</hi> and Proſperity are Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I had almoſt ſaid Inſinite; and the Duties which are expected from Perſons in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are proportionably ſo too.

The Indigent Man hath only his own Virtue to take care of; the Rich muſt preſerve That, and hath another Task of Action and Diſtribution to take Care of afterwards. He that deveſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of large Poſſeſſions, is at leiſure for greater and better things, which mov'd ſome Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Chriſtians to do ſo. He does at the ſame time disburden himſelf of a world of Cares and Sorrows, of Duties and Diſſiculties unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which attend the Management of himſelf, firſt in the Purſuit and Acquiſition, then in the Keeping, then in the Uſing and Diſpenſing of Wealth. So that upon the whole Matter, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when done upon a Principle of Charity and Religion) This is only the declining of Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Buſineſs, and Trouble; and when ſuch Men pretend to Reſignation, and Magnanimity, and Contempt of the World, I ſhould make no ſcruple to tell them very freely, <hi>Gentlemen, You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe things, not becauſe They are Advantageous, and You are get above them, but becauſe You know not how to make a right uſe of them, and are afraid of the Trouble and Hazard, which thoſe who make it their Buſineſs to poſſeſs and manage them as they ought, are of neceſſity expoſed to.</hi> For when all is done, though <hi>Riches</hi> do not deſerve our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and are an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>too low</hi> for our <hi>Affections,</hi> yet they are as much <hi>too high</hi> for our <hi>Diſdain.</hi> And tho' no Wiſe Man will ſuffer himſelf to be brought into Bondage to them, nor deſire them Immoderately, nor get them Indirectly, nor place his <hi>Happineſs</hi> in them; yet when the Bounty of Providence hath dealt them to us fairly, and made them our <hi>Lot;</hi> in ſuch a Caſe what <hi>Seneca</hi> hath obſerved is undoubtedly

There is not in the World any thing ſo feeble as an irregular and unſteady Motion; and therefore <hi>Anger,</hi> which is ſuch in the Mind, is rather a Mark of Infirmity and Cowardiſe. It is a Diſtemper in the Soul, which makes it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſore, not able to endure Offences; as Hurts and Wounds in the Body render the Smart of every little Blow intolerable.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Signs and Symptoms of this Paſſion are many, and manifeſt,<note place="margin">Signs of it.</note> more and more viſible than thoſe of any other; and ſo Strange and Strong, that they make a mighty Difference in the Perſon, alter the whole Temper and Frame both of Body and Mind, transform and turn him into quite another Man. Inſomuch, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Ut ſit difficile, utrum magis deteſtabile vitium, aut deforme.</note> 
                        <hi>it is not eaſy to ſay, whether this Vice be more deteſtable, or more deformed and disfiguring;</hi> Some of theſe Changes and Symptoms, are outward and apparent: Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſtortions of the Face, Fieryneſs of the Eyes, a wild and enraged Look, Deaſneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility in the Ears, Foaming at the Mouth, Palpitation of the Heart; Quickneſs and Uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pulſe, Swelling and Burſting Fullneſs of the Veins, Stammering in the Tongue, Gnaſhing and Setting of the Teeth, Loudneſs and Hoarſneſs in the Voice, The Speech thick and indiſtinct; and in ſhort, The whole Body is ſet on Fire, and in a perfect Fever. Some have been tranſported to ſuch a Degree, upon theſe Occaſions, that their very Veins have broke, their Urine ſtopt, and they have dropt down Dead, being ſtifled and ſtrangled with exceſs of Paſſion. And what Condition can we ſuppoſe their Mind muſt be in in the mean while, when the Diſorders of the Body are ſo Violent and Diſmal? <hi>Anger</hi> at the firſt Bruſh, quite baniſhes <hi>Reaſon</hi> and confounds the Judgment; clears all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and takes poſſeſſion for it ſelf alone; and when it hath got it, then it ſills all with Fire and Smoke, with Darkneſs and Confuſion, with Noiſe and Clamour; It is like a Robber, or an Enemy, that firſt drives the Maſter out of Doors, and then ſets
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53648:137"/>Fire to his Houſe, and that, with ſuch Fury and Madneſs, as to deſtroy and burn it ſelf alive in het Flames. It is like a Ship that hath neither Rudder, nor Pilot; neither Sails, nor Oars, nor Ballaſt; but floats about at Random, and commits it ſelf to the Mercy of Winds, and Waves, and that, when the Sea rides Higheſt, and the Storms are Loudeſt and moſt Raging. And what can be expected in ſuch a Caſe, but Strandings and Shipwracks, when there are ſo many Rocks on every Side, to break her to Pieces, ſo many Quick-Sands to ſwallow her up, when ſhe thus lets her ſelf drive upon them?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This leads us to conſider its <hi>Effects;</hi> which are indeed, very great, and for the moſt Part,<note place="margin">Its Effects.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly Wretched, and Deplorable.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. For Firſt; <hi>Anger</hi> urges and expoſes us to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice;</hi> it takes Fire afreſh, and is rendred more Violent and Fierce, by any Oppoſition, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Reaſonable and Fair; and that too, not only by Diſpute from others, but even from a Man's own Senſes and Reflection, and the being Conſcious to himſelf, that he is Angry, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt Cauſe, or to a greater Degree than the Provocation deſerved. When a Man hath thus fuſſer'd his <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be ſhaken and diſturbed, let one with all the Calmneſs imaginable, offer the cleareſt Vindication, the juſteſt Excuſe, any thing to remove or mitigate this Paſſion, all is to no Purpoſe, or to worſe than none; for Truth and Innocence are ſtill but more enraging, as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves: In ſuch Caſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Pertinaciores nos facit iniquitas irae, quaſi argumentum ſit juſtè iraſcendi, graviter iraſci.</note> 
                        <hi>the Unreaſonableneſs of our Paſſion makes us ſo much more obſtinate and unperſuada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if the being very Angry, and Implacable, were the beſt Argument that the Ground of our Anger is Juſt.</hi> The Example of <hi>Piſo</hi> upon this Occaſion is well
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53648:138"/>worth our Obſervation, and the Story is generally known. He, who was in other Reſpects Eminent for Virtue and Goodneſs, yet once in Heat of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion pat Three Perſons to Death Unjuſtly; and ſtrain'd the Law to bring them in Guilty, only becauſe there had been one proved not Guilty, whom he by a former Sentence had adjudged Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Anger</hi> is likewiſe exaſperated by <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Coldneſs,</hi> becauſe ſuch Indiſſerence ſpeaks Scorn and Neglect; and when Men ſee their Reſentments make no Impreſſion, they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſlighted and affronted. This is very uſual with Women, who oftentimes put themſelves into a Paſſion, purely for the Sake of putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People into one too; And when they ſee, that a Man does not condeſcend to be Angry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to heap on more Fewel, they take all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Pains to cheriſh and blow up their own Fire, and grow perfectly Outragious. So Wild and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage a Beaſt is <hi>Anger,</hi> ſo Fierce and Intractable, that neither Vindications nor Submiſſions; neither Excuſing nor Acknowledging; neither Speaking nor holding one's Peace, can do any Goood upon it. No ſoul Means can tame, no fair ones win it over, or make it Gentle. The Injuſtice of this Paſſion is farther Evident, in that it always takes upon it ſelf to be both Party and Judge in the ſame Cauſe; in that it expects all manner of People that hear or know any thing of the Matter, ſhould take its Part, and juſtify its Proceedings; and takes it mortally Ill, nay, flies in the very Faces of all that either ſtand Neuter, or in any Degree ſeem to think it in the Wrong.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Second Effect of this Paſſion is <hi>Headineſs</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> Raſhneſs and Inconſideration. It drives us forward, and thruſts us down Head-long, into unſpeakable Miſchiefs; and very often draws upon our own Heads the very Calamities we are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53648:138"/>endeavouring to avoid by being Angry; the very ſame Sufferings, or many times worſe than thoſe, which We in the bitterneſs of our Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, are ſo eager to inflict upon others; and thas, while it puniſhes an Enemy, it tortures and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it ſelf. This <hi>Paſſion</hi> is no ill Reſemblance of <hi>Great Rains,</hi> which cruſh indeed, and batter what ever they fall upon, but in the ſame Fall, break themſelves to Pieces. <hi>Anger</hi> is ſo eagerly bent upon the Hurt and Deſtruction of others, that it ſights out of all Guard, and takes no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Care to avoid or ward off its own Death. It draws us in, and hampers us in a Thouſand Inconveniences; puts us upon ſpeaking and doing many things, that are Baſe and Unworthy, ſuch as by no means become us, and what we cannot but be, at leaſt we ought to be, moſt heartily Aſhamed of. To be ſhort; it tranſports Men to thoſe Exceſſes of Extravagance and Rage, that they know not what they do; enſnares them in the moſt Injurious, the moſt Scandalous Actions; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them into Miſchief incapable of any Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Murders and Bloodſhed; Treachery and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, Poiſonings, and ſecret Aſſaſſinations. Things that leave long and laſting Remorſe behind, and ſuch as they cannot but have very afflicting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ever after. <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> was a remarkable Inſtance of this Kind; and <hi>

                           </gap>ythageras</hi> uſed to ſay, that <hi>where Anger ended, there Repentance always began.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> This <hi>Paſſion</hi> is never to be convinced of <hi>Folly;</hi> it is Big, and always well Satisfied with its own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion and Juſtice; flatters and pleaſes it ſelf with a Notion, that the Man does well, and wiſely, to be Angry; clears it ſelf from all manner of Blame, and lays the whole Fault upon ſome ill or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Thing done, that gave the Provocation. But, ſuppoſing another guilty of Injuſtice, it will
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53648:139"/>not therefore follow, that my Anger is guilty of none. Suppoſe I receive Injury from another Hand, will my paying back the ſame, or a greater Wrong, take off what I ſuffer? Will it make me any real Amends, or bring any true Profit to me, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Suffers as well as I? The Truth is, <hi>Anger</hi> hath too much of Obſtinacy, and Hair-brain'd Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ever to do any Good. It pretends to cure one Evil, with another; and when we turn over an Offence to be corrected by this Paſſion, it is no better than ſetting Vice to chaſtiſe and puniſh it ſelf. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which ought always to bear the Sword, and exerciſe the Supreme Authority in our Breaſts, does not deſire any ſuch Hot-Headed Officers to Execute her Commands, as do things upon their own Head, without waiting for Orders. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> like Nature, works eaſily and gradually, is ſedate and ſlow; and whatever is Violent, is equally Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and contrary to both.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, What? muſt Virtue then be ſo Tame and ſoft, as to ſee the Inſolencies of Vice Triumphant, without any Degree of Indignation and Concern? Muſt ſhe be ſo bound up, as not to take the Liberty of being Angry, nor dare to make any Oppoſition againſt unreaſonable and wicked Men? To this I anſwer. <hi>Virtue</hi> hath its Freedoms, but they are ſuch as are Juſt; it takes, it deſires none, that are unſit, or unbecoming. It hath Courage too, but this Courage muſt not be employed againſt it ſelf. Nor muſt another Man's Ill be converted to its Prejudice and Diſturbance. A wiſe Man is as much obliged to bear the Vices of Naughty People without Paſſion, as he is to ſee their Proſperity without Envy. The Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of raſh and heady Men, muſt be endured with the ſame Patience and Pity, that a Good Phyſician exerciſes toward his Patients, when they are under the Ravings of a Fever. There is not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53648:139"/>any one Inſtance of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> more Commendable in it ſelf, nor more uſeful to the General Good of the World, than that of being able to bear with the Follies and Extravagances of other People. For if we do not ſo, the Conſequence will be, that we ſhall fall into the ſame Extravagances; and by not ſupporting Their Follies, we make them our Own.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>HAtred</hi> is a very odd Paſſion. It gives us a great deal of unaccountable Vexation, contrary to all the Reaſon in the World. And yet, What is there more Torturing and Inſupportable, than this Reſentment? By It we put our ſelves perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the Thing we hate; and give it a Power to afflict and torment us. The Sight of it diſturbs our Senſes, ruffles our Spirits, and makes the whole Body Sick, and Diſordered: The Remembrance of it raiſes a Storm in our Minds; and ſleeping or waking, ſills us with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53648:140"/>and Impatience. The Ideas of ſuch Objects, are always hideous and ſhocking; and we never entertain them without Indignation and Horror, Spight or Grief; ſome Reſentment not eaſy to be expreſt, which puts us beſide our ſelves, and rends our very Heart aſunder. Thus we feel in our own Perſons, all that Torment we wiſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and undergo the Puniſhment we think due to Him. He that hateth, is at this Rate the <hi>Patient,</hi> and he that is hated, the <hi>Agent.</hi> Thus it certainly is to all Intents and Purpoſes; excepting only, that we think ſit to expreſs it otherwiſe, and deceive our ſelves with Words, and Names of Things; For it is evident to common Senſe, that the <hi>Haler</hi> is in Pain, and the <hi>Perſon beted,</hi> in perfect Eaſe; perhaps too, in perfect Ignorance of the Matter. But after all, let us conſider, and examine this Point a little. What is it that we hate? Men? or Things? Be it the one, or the other, 'tis plain we do not pitch upon the right Object. For if any thing in the World deſerves to be Hated heartily, it is <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it ſelf,</hi> and ſuch other Paſſions, which, like this, breed Diſcords, and raiſe Tumults in our Minds, and rebel againſt that Power, which of Right ought to Command, and bear an abſolute Sway in us. For when our Enemies have done all they can, ſtill neither They, nor any Thing elſe, but ſuch exorhitant Paſſions as theſe, can do us any real, and eſſectual Injury.</p>

                        <hi>Jealouſie</hi> is a Diſeaſe of the Soul; an Argument of great Weakneſs; an evil and a fooliſh Diſeaſe, but withal a furious and terrible one: It rages and tyrannizes over the Mind; inſinuates it ſelf under the pretence of extraordinary Friendſhip and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: But when it hath gotten Head, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Poſſeſſion, it builds a mortal Hatred upon the Foundation of Kindneſs.

And thus it is with the Rage and Folly, the Noiſe and Brawlings, the Impudence and Impotent Malice of Fools: They never ſhake great Souls, nor carry ſo far as lofty and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Minds: An <hi>Alexander</hi> or a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> an <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> or a <hi>Scipio,</hi> cannot be mov'd by all that ſuch mean Wretches could do or ſay: For all truly Brave Men, and theſe in particular, have been ſo far from meditating <hi>Revenge,</hi> that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they were remarkable <hi>for doing good to their Enomies.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is alſo a <hi>Paſſion full of Injuſtice;</hi> for it tortures an innocent Perſon, and adds Grief and Pain to Him, that was wounded and afflicted before. It is properly the Party's Buſineſs who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Offence, to labour under the Remorſe and the Puniſhment; and all thoſe other ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53648:142"/>which the Deſire of Revenge unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably draws after it. And yet by this, the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foring and Guiltleſs Party makes it his Care to load himſelf with theſe heavy Burdens, as if the receiving of the Injury were not of it ſelf Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſufficient, without ſuch voluntary and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Aggravations. Thus it happens frequently, (generally indeed) that, while the Innocent and Injur'd is racking himſelf with the impatient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the Contrivance of proper Methods for Revenge, the guilty Aggreſſour enjoys himſelf in Eaſe and Pleaſure, and perhaps makes the Other's Uneaſineſs a Jeſt and a Diverſion. But This is only the Beginning of Miſchiefs and Injuſtice; for the Means of putting ſuch Deſires in execution are yet inſinitely more ſo; which indeed are of all, of any kinds; Baſeneſs and Treachery, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Subornation, a ſecret Stab, or an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade of Ruſſians; in ſhort, the fouleſt, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt Villanous Deſigns: For one peculiar ill Effect of this Vice is, that it extinguiſhes all Natural Juſtice, breaks through all the Reſtraints of Honour and Duty, and ſticks at no Practice, tho' never ſo foul and deteſtable, to accompliſh its Bloody Intentions.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly. The very Execution of theſe Deſigns, is not only painful and difficult; but extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: For Experience ſhews us daily, that he who endeavours to revenge himſelf, does not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his whole Wiſh, nor is in every Point ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Either he meets with a Defeat, and cannot do the Miſchief he wou'd; or at leaſt he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed as to his own Security and Satisfaction, and ſuffers the Miſchief he wou'd not. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to put out One of his Enemy's Eyes, and at the ſame time puts out Both his own. He renders himſelf obnoxious to Juſtice, and brings Trouble and Danger to all his Friends; is loſt to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53648:143"/>the World, and to his own Quiet; fore'd to hide and flee from Place to Place, and is every where dogg'd cloſe at the Heels by his own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fears.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And after all; the Killing an Enemy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching him out of the way, may be <hi>Cruelty;</hi> but it is not properly <hi>Revenge:</hi> For a Man does then only take Satisfaction and Revenge, when he Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his Enemy, and forces him to Suffering and Submiſſion; not when he puts him paſt all Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and out of the reach of his Anger; the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of which Senſible and Painful, is the only End Revenge can propoſe to it ſelf. Accordingly we ſee, no Man is ſo vain and abſurd, to fall foul upon a Stone, or a Brute; becauſe he knows theſe cannot feel, or cannot conſider the Effects of his Rage. In all true Revenge, it is neceſſary, that the Perſon who executes it, ſhou'd receive ſome Satisfaction in the Pains he inflicts; and that the Perſon, on whom it is inflicted, ſhould feel the Smart, and be humbled by the Sorrow, and pay ſo dear for the Injury he hath done, that he may be made to repent it. But a Man that is killed, is out of any condition of Grief or Repentance; he is indeed from thenceforth eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſecur'd from all manner of Suſſering: Whereas, on the contrary, the Revenger himſelf continues in a Capacity of both, and oftentimes feels the Weight of his own Diſpleaſure, by a State of fix'd Sorrow and Fear ever after. <hi>Killing</hi> then is only a Betraying of our Cowardiſe. It is the Conſequence of our being afraid, that the Perſon we intend to puniſh, ſhou'd Reſent to our Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and take an opportunity of paying us again in our own Coin. We are willing from theſe Apprehenſions to make an End of him at once, and rid our ſelves from any future Hazard; which is indeed to quit our Point, to loſe the End of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53648:143"/>Revenge, and caſt a Blemiſh upon our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

And, as if all this were not enough, we refine and improve the Deceit, we even Hire Men on purpoſe to put on this Folly, to ſtand as Mutes, or to make dreadful Lamentations; to move and heighten a Paſſion which ought to be ſuppreſt; to give Groans and Sighs for a Price, ſuch as we all know are feign'd and extorted; to ſhed Tears for the Entertainment of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, ſuch as fall, only when they are ſeen to do ſo, and are immediately dry'd up, as ſoon as the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53648:145"/>Company retires: And, pray, Where does Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach us any thing like This? What can there be indeed more abſurd and vain; what does Nature condemn, what does it deteſt more than ſuch Inſincerity? This is nothing but Opinion and Faſhion, the Cauſe and Cheriſher of almoſt all our Paſſions; the Tyranny of Cuſtom, and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Errour, that inſtructs Men to indulge their Grief in ſuch a formal manner. From hence it is, that, if a Man be not deeply enough affected in his own Perſon, and cannot furniſh a ſufficient proportion of Tears and hanging Looks out of his own Stock, he is thought oblig'd to hire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Supply from others who make a Trade of it. So that for the ſatisfying what the World calls <hi>Decency,</hi> we put our ſelves to vaſt Expence; which Nature, if we wou'd take Her Judgment, is ſo far from preſcribing, that She moſt freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits us of, nay condemns us for it. Is not this, in truth, a publick and ſtudy'd Aſſront upon Reaſon and Common Senſe, a Conſtraint and a Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Nature, a Proſtituting and Debauching of the Manhood in us, a Mocking the World, and making a Jeſt of our ſelves; and that for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, but merely to comply with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the abſurd Vulgar, which abound in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as Falſhood and Miſtake, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire nothing ſo much as Counterfeit and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe?</p>
                     <p>Nor are our Private Sorrows much better:<note place="margin">Private.</note> For Theſe, whatever they may ſeem, are no more Natural than the former. Did Nature inſpire or dictate them, they wou'd be common to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; they wou'd affect all Mankind almoſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſince All partake of the ſame Nature, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only in ſome few, ſome ſmall Circumſtances. But here we find very different Reſentments: The ſame Objects, which afflict and grieve ſome, are
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53648:146"/>Matter of Joy and Satisfaction to others; and what draws Tears and bitter Cries from one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and one Country, is receiv'd with great Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by another. What One does, Another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves; and the Friends of Mourners think it their Duty to exhort, to comfort, to chide them, to beg that they wou'd recollect themſelves, call in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to their Aſſiſtance, be Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and dry up their Tears. Obſerve the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Them who take pains to afflict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; hear what they ſay when you have given them this good Counſel; They will make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to acknowledge, that it is a Folly and a Weakneſs, to be guilty of exceſſive Paſſions; they will commend and call thoſe happy, who can ſtand the Shock of Adverſity, and have ſo much Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of Temper, and ſuch Preſence of Mind, as to meet an Affliction bravely, and bear it ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and ſet a gallant and Maſculine Spirit in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray againſt it. Thus they <hi>excuſe,</hi> but they dare not <hi>juſtifie</hi> their own Concern; They ſay, they cannot help it, and by that Apology, lament, if not condemn themſelves; for this implies they Wiſh, and think it were better, if they cou'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome their Grief. And, in truth, the thing is very plain in theſe private Mournings too, that Men do not ſo much ſute their Sorrows to their Sufferings, as to the receiv'd Notions of thoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom they dwell and converſe. And if we take a cloſe and nicer View, this will diſcover to us, that <hi>Opinion</hi> is at the bottom of all our immoderate Melancholy; That our Torment and Vexation proceeds from the falſe Repreſentations of Things; and that we grieve, either ſooner than we ought, by Anticipation, and Fear, and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Apprehenſions of what will come hereafter; Which, like ſo many falſe Perſpectives, ſet the Object nearer our Sight, or elſe magnifie the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53648:146"/>Bulk of it to our Eye, and ſo make us grieve more than we ought, upon a Suppoſal of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being much greater, than really it is.</p>

And really we are then a miſerable Sight, our Head hanging down, our Eyes fixed upon the Ground, our Tongue Speechleſs, our Limbs ſtiff and Motionleſs, our Looks Wild and Confuſed, our Ears Deaf and Inſenſible, our Minds void of all Attention and compoſed Thought.

What better Conſtruction can any Man in Reaſon put upon our Raſh Complaints, and Outragious Paſſions, than a Mind diſcontented with the Great Governour of the Univerſe, and his Diſpoſals of Us, and our Affairs? To murmur and repine at what is done by Him, is to find Fault with him who does it; and in an oblique, and little more reſpectful Way, to charge him with Folly or Hard-dealing. The Law and Condition, which he hath fixed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Government of the World, is, that all things in theſe Sublunary Regions ſhall be Changeable and Inconſtant, ever in Motion, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53648:147"/>ſubject to Decays and Death. If then we know this to be their Condition, why do we afflict our ſelves for that, which is the common Fate of all here below; for that which could not be New, and ſhould not be a Surpriſe to us; what if we did not, yet we might, and ought to have expected? And if we did not know this, the trueſt and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſonable Matter for grieving, is our own moſt wretched Ignorance, Of a Truth, ſo Evident, ſo Uſeful, ſo Neceſſary to be known; a Truth, that Nature hath Graven every where, in Characters ſo Large and Legible, that it is impoſſible for us to go abroad and not meet it, or to turn our Eyes any way at home, and not read it. Others, our Selves, and Every Thing carry this Inſcription. Alas! we miſtake our Poſt, and Quality. Man's Buſineſs here is not to give Laws, but to receive and ſubmit to them. The Adminiſtration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, is lodged in higher and better Hands. The Order of the Univerſe is eſtabliſhed; and We, who are but a very ſmall Part of this vaſt Body, muſt follow the Motions of the Whole, and take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly what falls to our Share. To fret and vex our ſelves, is to be concern'd, that Eternal Ordinances, are not reverſed and diſſetled for our Sakes; that We are not made an Exception to all Created Nature; which, beſides the Intolerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, and Impiety it is guilty of againſt God, is no leſs inſupportable Folly with Reſpect to our ſelves; for it mends not the Matter one whit, but adds Weight to what Providence hath laid upon us already, and makes all our Sufferings double.</p>

How many Wretches, do we ſee every Day; Wretches of their own making? who actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Unhappy for the very Dread of being ſo, and have improv'd their Empty Fears, into Solid and Subſtantial Miſeries? How many People have loſt their Friends, merely through Diſtruſt, and not daring to make Uſe of them? and how many have made themſelves ſick, with the very Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Apprehenſions of Sickneſs? Here is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53648:151"/>Coxcomb, that fancies his Wife hath played him Foul, and teazes himſelf into a Conſumption, 'till he pines and droops into his Grave, with this tormenting Suſpicion. Another anxious Fool is afraid of falling into Poverty, and he racks himſelf into a Diſeaſe; and dies, for Fear of not having enough to live upon. Nay, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, who have been kill'd with the very Fear of Death; and that you may not think this ſo very odd, let me obſerve to you, that ſomething like it happens every Day in moſt, if not in all the Objects of this Paſſion. Our <hi>Fear,</hi> generally ſerving to very little Purpoſe, otherwiſe than the drawing down upon our Heads, the very thing we Pretend to run away from. Undoubtedly no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity whatſoever, is near ſo great, or grievous to be born, as the Fear of it. For Other Evils can hurt us only while they have a Real Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and are actually upon us; when the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is removed, the <hi>Effect</hi> and the Pain immediately ceaſe. But <hi>Fear</hi> is not ſo confin'd; It extends to Things that have no Being, as well as to ſuch as have; nay, to things which neither are, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ever will be; and, that we may be aſſur'd, there is no End of its Extravagances, it fixes ſometimes upon things which we may be very confident never can be. So very ingenious is this Paſſion to torment us, ſo malicious and ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo mercileſs a Tyrant; It extracts real and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pains out of Shadows; and refines upon Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Evils, till it conſolidates, and makes them weighty ones: And for thoſe which miniſter ſome Ground for Fear, it is wonderful buſie, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely officious; it takes Poſt, and brings us News, which it were better not to hear; for it creates imaginary, and anticipates all our actual Sufferings, by Opinion and Expectation.</p>

                        <hi>Fear</hi> does not only fill us with dreadful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and oftentimes diſturb our Repoſe with falſe Alarms; but, which is worſe, it taints and deſtroys all our Happineſs, breaks in upon our Quiet, and checks all our Delights. No Man can be eaſie, or take pleaſure in the Enjoyment of a Bleſſing, which he is in perpetual fear of Loſing. Life it ſelf cannot be a Satisfaction to a Man that lives in dread of Dying: And One of the Ancients hath obſerv'd very truly, That no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can miniſter true Joy to us, which we have not ſuch a Maſtery of, as to be prepared to part with it, whenever Providence ſhall demand it back again.</p>

It ariſes ſometimes from want of Courage, it is provoked by a Proſpect of Dangers; and yet it frequently doubles our Difficulties, and expoſes us to greater Dangers: For it makes us eager and impatient to deliver our ſelves from them; and thus it caſts us into Confuſions and Amazements, perplexes our Judgment, blinds our Underſtanding, and hinders us from diſcerning and taking the proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of getting out of the Labyrinths we are in. It diſtracts us with Terrours, and drives the Mind back again into it ſelf, where the Violence of its Paſſion interrupts the Debates, and overlooks thoſe very Opportunities of eſcaping, that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Add to this, the great Dejection and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which will not let us dare to do what we ought, for our Safety; we loſe our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Reſolution to uſe it; we flee when no Man purſues, ſtart and tremble at our own Shadow; nay, flee from that which is our beſt and only Sanctuary, run away from our Friends, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53648:152"/>apprehend Deſtruction from them which advance to our Relief.<note n="*" place="bottom">Adeo etiam auxilia pavor formidat.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> HItherto we have conſider'd <hi>Man</hi> entire, and with regard to <hi>Himſelf</hi> alone:<note place="margin">A uſeful but diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, ſuch as Man is partial in.</note> The next Step, by which we propoſe to advance in the Knowledge of him, is by ſtating a Compariſon between Him and other Animals; and This is a very excellent help toward making a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Caſe. Now this Compariſon is of large extent; it conſiſts of many Branches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great Skill, and wou'd prove of mighty Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Conſequence, if well and truly made: But the Queſtion is, Who muſt make it? Shall Man? He is a Party in the Cauſe, and liable to very juſt Exception; for it is much to be fear'd, when the <hi>Iſſue</hi> is his own Concern, the <hi>Verdict</hi> will not be honeſt. And accordingly we ſee, how partial and unfair he is in all he ſays of Himſelf; for he knows no Mean, he proceeds with no Moderation, but is eternally in Extremes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is big, and pleas'd with Himſelf; looks down upon the lower World with Diſdain; and calls himſelf the <hi>Lord of all the Creatures;</hi> divides their Morſels among them, and cuts out for each Species, ſuch a Proportion of Faculties, and natural Power, as His Lordſhip, vouchſafes to allow them: At Other times, inſtead of all this Gayety and Pride, you find him full of black Diſcontent, and then he debaſes himſelf as much, murmurs and frets, grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53648:153"/>and complains, gives Providence hard Words, and calls Nature a cruel Step-mother, that hath made him the Refuſe of the World, the moſt wretched of all her Productions; and dealt to Him the leaſt and loweſt Portion of all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now in truth, both the One and the Other of theſe Opinions are equally falſe, unreaſonable, and extravagant. But what can we expect better from him? or how is it to be thought, he ſhou'd carry himſelf evenly and fairly, and act juſtly with other Creatures, when he is, as we ſhall ſhortly ſee, ſo infinitely out of all meaſure, in his Notions towards God, his Superiour; and Man, who is his Equal? But, beſides this Byaſs upon his <hi>Judgment,</hi> there is another Difficulty upon his <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> For which way ſhall he get a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Knowledge of the inward Powers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Motions of other Animals? So that if he were inclin'd to be Juſt, and to hear the Evidence impartially, yet he muſt needs be an improper Judge, to whom the moſt material part upon which the Sentence ought to be grounded, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given in Evidence. And ſuch are thoſe inward Operations of Brutes, which we can have no certain or competent perception of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we will try at preſent to ſtate this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, as evenly, and calmly, as we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now firſt, we are to conſider, that the Order and Conſtitution of the Univerſe is not vaſtly unequal; There are no great Irregularities, nor large void Spaces in it; nor ſuch Unlikeneſs and wide Diſproportion between the ſeveral Parts that go into this Compoſition, as ſome People may imagine. The Excellencies of the ſeveral Species riſe and fall gradually; And thoſe, whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath placed near, or cloſe to one another, have all of them a mutual Reſemblance; tho'
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53648:154"/>ſome have more, and ſome have leſs of it. And thus we may obſerve a near Neighbourhood, and cloſe Affinity between Mankind and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. They are a-kin in many things, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Properties are alike, and common to both. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things indeed there are, wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; but theſe are not ſo vaſtly diſproportionate and diſtant, but that they ſtill are next adjoyning Links, twiſted within one another, in the great Chain of the Univerſe. So that Man is neither in all reſpects ſuperiour, nor inferiour in all. <hi>For that which befalleth the Sons of Men, befalleth Beaſts; even one thing befalleth them both;</hi> ſays the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God himſelf.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We will begin with thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both, and very near the Matter of being alike in both; ſuch as, <hi>Generation, Nutrition, Motion, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> For (ſays the ſame Divine <hi>Wiſdom</hi>) <hi>As the one dieth, ſo doth the other; ſo that a Man</hi> (in this reſpect) <hi>hath no Pre-eminence above a Beaſt.</hi> And This is a Confutation of thoſe fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh repining People, and all their melancholy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that repreſent Man, as the only Creature, whom Nature hath diſcountenanc'd and diſgrac'd, abandon'd and forſaken; turn'd naked into the wide World, and caſt upon the bare Ground; without any Covering, without any Natural Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to ſhelter or defend him; bound up, and ſwaddel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Man,</hi> poor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53648:154"/>neglected Man, (they tell you) is Taught to Go, Taught to Speak; nay, requires Help and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the very Feeding and Supporting himſelf, and attains to nothing without Time and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſerving an Apprenticeſhip.

Some aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Effects, and peculiar Properties, that are inimitable, unaccountable, nay incredible: Such as That of the Fiſh call'd <hi>Remora,</hi> becauſe, tho' ſmall it ſelf in Compariſon, yet it ſtops the largeſt Ships in their Courſe: Inſtances of which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory gives us, in the Veſſel that rode Admiral of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi>'s and <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Fleet: That of the <hi>Cramp-Fiſh,</hi> which benumbs People's Limbs at ſome diſtance, and tho' they never touch him: That of the <hi>Hedg-Hog,</hi> which hath a Fore-knowledge of the Winds: And That of the <hi>Cameleon</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypus,</hi> in changing Colours, and taking a freſh Tincture, according to the Things they reſt upon. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Their ſtrange Prognoſtications; of Birds, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in their leaving one Country, and going into another, according as the Weather, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year change: That of all Beaſts that are Dams, in knowing which of all their Young will prove the beſt; for when they are driven to Straits, and put upon preſerving them from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they conſtantly ſave the Beſt firſt.

Now Two Objections may be offered in Bar to this Claim; the One Relating to the Thing it ſelf; the Other to the real Worth, and Benefits of it. Firſt, It is not out of all Diſpute, whether the Matter of Fact, ſet forth in this Claim, be True; that is, whether Men have theſe Excellencies pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves. It hath ever been, and ever will be, a Point in Controverſy, whether Brutes have none of theſe Spiritual Powers; and that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which holds the Affirmative, and maintains they have, is ſupported with greateſt Authorities, and ſeems to carry a greater Appearance of Truth. The moſt Celebrated and Learned Philoſophers have declared for it; No leſs than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch, Democritus</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras.</hi> The Reaſon, upon which they ground that Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is this; That, the <hi>Brain</hi> is the Particular Organ, the part of the Body, employed by the Soul, in the Acts of Ratiocination; and that The Compoſition of the Brain, is exactly the ſame in Brutes, as it is in Men; and from hence they conclude, that the Inſtrument of Reaſon, is as apt and capable in one of theſe Creatures, as it is in the other. The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53648:158"/>then will be, whether the Souls be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Capable, of uſing this Inſtrument to ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and for This, they offer Experience; That Brutes conclude <hi>Univerſals</hi> from <hi>Singulars;</hi> as, from the Sight and Form of One Man, to know the ſame Humane Form in All Men; That they are able to compound, and to divide Idea's, by aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refuſing; and that they exerciſe a Power of Choice, and make very Subtile Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> in ſuch Caſes as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Life, the Liberty, and Preſervation of Themſelves, and their Young. Nay, they pretend, that any Man, who obſerves with Attention, may read and diſcover ſeveral Strokes and Foot-ſteps of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> more Bold, more Judicious, more Nice, more Ingenious and Cunning, than the common Sort of Men are uſed to give us Proof of. Some of the moſt memorable Actions, from whence this Concluſion hath been made, I will briefly recite. The <hi>Fox</hi> deſigning to paſs over a River, when it is frozen, lays his Ear cloſe to the Ice, to hearken if there be any Noiſe, and whether the Water run underneath; that from thence he may form a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be Safe to proceed, or Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to retire. And this Expedient the <hi>Thracians</hi> are ſaid to make uſe of, when they have any Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Rivers to paſs. The Hound, in Doubt which Way his Maſter, or the Game he is in chaſe of, went, at a Place where Three Paths meet, takes this Courſe of making out his Loſs; He ſcents the ſeveral Paths, one after another, and when he finds that in Two of theſe Ways, no Scent hath lain; he never troubles himſelf to lay his Noſe to the Third; but ſprings forward, and takes That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther Enquiry. <hi>Thales</hi> the Philoſopher's Mule, when heavy loaden with a Sack of Salt, and being to go over a Brook, ſtoop'd down to diſſolve his Salt, and ſo make his Burthen lighter; becauſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53648:158"/>he had found once before, that the Salt was lighter, when it fell into the Water by chance: But when loaden with Wooll, he did the direct contrary, and ſtrove to keep it dry; becauſe the like Experiment had taught him, that Wooll grows heavier by being wetted. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, That once on board a Ship, he ſaw a Dog caſting Stones into a Great Jar, that ſo he might make the Oyl in it riſe higher; which before was too low, and out of his reach: And the like is reported of the Crows in <hi>Barbary,</hi> when the Water is too low for them, to drink at. Thus <hi>Elephants,</hi> when one of them is ſet faſt in a Bog, are ſaid to bring great Stones, and pieces of Timber, to help their Fellows out. The <hi>Oxen</hi> in the King's Gardens at <hi>Suza,</hi> which have been long practiſed to turn a Wheel a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Times Round, (the Depth of the Well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring juſt ſo much, from whence Water is drawn, for the Uſe of the Gardens) cannot be made to exceed that Number of Rounds; and when left to themſelves, never come One turn Short. Now what Way are all theſe things poſſible to be done, without Reaſoning and Diſcourſe; Compoſition and Diviſion, which are the Operations proper to a Rational Soul? Muſt not a Man be thought to want Reaſon himſelf, who thinks it hath nothing to do in ſuch Actions? So again. The Marvellous dexterity of drawing Darts and Spears out of wounded Bodies, with very little Pain to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, for which Elephants are Famous. The Dog mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that at a Publick Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lay upon a Scaffold, and countefeited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dead; fainting away by degrees, breathing ſhort, trembling, ſtretching himſelf out, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them drag him about as quite dead; then by Degrees coming to himſelf again, lifting up his Head, as if he had juſt been brought to Life; and in a Word, the many Strange, Apiſh Tricks
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53648:159"/>that Jugglers and Strowlers teach their Dogs, and Dancing-Horſes. The many Doubles, and cunning Contrivances, that Beaſts of ſeveral kinds have, to ſecure themſelves from the Attempts we make upon them; The great Forecaſt, and wiſe Management of the <hi>Ants,</hi> in drawing out their Grains of Corn to ſweeten in the Air, and dry by the Sun, which would otherwiſe corrupt, and grow Muſty: The nibbling off the End of every Grain, which would elſe be grown, and run to Seed: The Order of the <hi>Bees,</hi> in their Republick; the Method of their Combs; the vaſt variety of Offices and Duties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſuch and ſuch reſpectively; and the conſtant Regularity and Uniformity of all their Proceedings, will not ſuffer us to think, that theſe are no more than animated <hi>Clock-Work;</hi> but ſeem in many Things to equal, and in ſome even to reproach the Conduct of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> In Order to overthrow all This, ſome have been very Ill-natur'd to theſe Brutes,<note place="margin">Natural Inſtinct, rejected.</note> and take Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Natural Inſtinct,</hi> as a ſufficient Solution, and Cauſe of all theſe wondrous Effects; And This they deſcribe by an Inclination in Nature, which is under as perpetual Neceſſity, Slavery, and Conſtraint; as That by which the Stone falls, or the Flame aſcends. Now Firſt, This is ſo far from Truth, that one would wonder, how it could ever enter into any Man's Head: For the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Acts, plainly infer reckoning and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up Particulars, comparing of Things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reaſoning by Compoſition and Diviſion of Ideas, and by Conſequences drawn from thence. But theſe are ſuch Operations as can never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſuch a Natural Inclination, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtinct, which are only the Refuge of Men, who want ſomething to ſay. But then it muſt be obſerv'd withal, that this Objection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns back again, upon them that make it. For
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53648:159"/>it is, without doubt, more Noble, more for the Honour of any Creature, and a nearer Reſemblance to God himſelf,<note place="margin">See the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to do Well by a Happy and Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Determination of one's Nature; than to do ſo by Art and Induſtry, long Time, and much Learning; To be led by the Unerring Hand of God, than left to our own imprudent Conduct; and to act Regularly, by an Habitual, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and Neceſſary Impulſe; than by ſuch a Choice and Liberty, as is Subject to Hazard and Raſhneſs. Beſides, by this Notion of Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, they take away from Brutes all manner of Inſtruction, and Improvement, as well that which they receive from others, as that which they impart to others; but This is abundantly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and confuted by Experience. For it is plain, They learn what they knew not before, and grow more Perfect by Degrees, and Imitation, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; as <hi>Magpyes,</hi> for Inſtance, <hi>Parrots, Jack-Daws,</hi> and <hi>Dogs;</hi> and it is as plain, that they teach one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother too, from the Examples of <hi>Nightingales</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Elephants,</hi> who of all Animals are the apteſt to learn, and ſeem to exceed the reſt by far, both in Largeneſs of Capacity, and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Apprehenſion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> As for that Power of the Reaſoning Soul, which Man Values himſelf ſo very Highly upon; That of conſidering Corporeal Things abſtractedly, repreſenting what is abſent to himſelf, and deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of what Circumſtances he thinks fit, to conceive them after his own Pleaſure; (for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Jargon of the Schools,<note n="*" place="bottom">Intellectum eſt in Intelligente, ad modum Intelligentis.</note> 
                        <hi>the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject underſtood, is in the Subject underſtanding, according to the manner in which the Underſtander repreſents it to himſelf,</hi>) there is ſome Appearance, that Beaſts do
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53648:160"/>all this too. A <hi>Horſe,</hi> that has been us'd to Charge, when he lies aſleep, in his Litter, ſhall ſhiver, and ſnort, as if he were in an Action; and plainly forms to himſelf, the Sounds of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the Images of an Army, and a Battle. The <hi>Grey-Hound,</hi> in his Dream, pants and blows, ſets up his Stern, ſhakes his Legs, and conceives a <hi>Spiritual Hare</hi> before him. <hi>Maſtiffs,</hi> and <hi>Houſe-Dogs,</hi> growl in their Sleep, and ſometimes open, and bark out-right, imagining that ſome Stranger is coming in. The faireſt Concluſion of this firſt Point ſeems to me then, to be thus; That the Brutes have Reaſon; That They compare, diſcourſe, and judge, but in a much lower Degree, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable, to that Perfection, in which Man does. They have a much leſs Share, but they are not Totally excluded. We excell Them vaſtly, and ſo we do one another; and, indeed, the ſeveral Kinds of Beaſts, excel each other too. Nay, I know not, whether it may not be ſaid, That the difference among Men, is Greateſt; and that ſome Men, excell ſome other Men in Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more than ſome Men excel Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 'tis true, pronounces of ſome Men, that they are ſo extremely Ignorant and Stupid, that they differ in nothing, but Shape, from Brutes. But all this notwithſtanding, to argue, that they have equal Share, and ſtand upon the Level with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that their Souls are equally Immortal with Ours, or Ours equally Mortal with theirs, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Malicious and unfair Inferences. For, beſides that Man excells moſt Conſpicuouſly, in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Reaſon, there are ſeveral other more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faculties and Prerogatives, ſuch as are entirely Spiritual, which juſtify the Character, of his being the Likeneſs and Image of God; and render him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>Immortal Bliſs;</hi> all which the Brutes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not of, in any the leaſt Degree. And theſe are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53648:160"/>all implyed in the Notion of Intellect, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes ſomething more Sublime, than mere Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The Other Argument, upon this Occaſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Worth and Benefit of this Pre-eminence. For, Allowing the Matter of Fact alledged, to be True, that Man hath Reaſon, and Brutes have it not, yet, What does he get by it? Are not the Nobleſt Faculties paid very Dear for, and do they not do him more Hurt than Good? Are not Theſe the principal Cauſe and Source of the Miſeries that load him? The Vices, the Paſſions, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſtempers, All that Irreſolution, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Deſpair, which embitter and caſt a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon our Lives? And theſe the Beaſts have none of, becauſe they have none of thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are the Seat and the Source of them. Witneſs the Story of <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s Hog, that eat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly on Shipboard, in a Storm, at a time when the Paſſengers and Seamen, were almoſt dead with Fear. <q>I confeſs, as we manage the Matter, the generality of People have but a very indifferent Bargain of This. And ſome who conſider Things Superficially, and look at what the World is, not what it might be,</q> are tempted to think that theſe more exalted and larger Endowments of the Soul, have been wholly deny'd, or at leaſt much diminiſhed, and impaired to Beaſts, for their mighty Eaſe and Benefit; and given to Man in their full Strength, for his mighty torment: Since it is by the Interpoſition and Aſſiſtance of theſe, that he teazes and perplexes himſelf; reſents and ſadly keeps alive the Paſt; is diſtracted with Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Amazement for the Future; nay, forms to his own Mind, and then is ſcared out of his Wits with, the gaſtly Images of Evils, that are not yet, nor are ever like to be. Now in other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the Senſe and the Apprehenſion of Evil have
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53648:161"/>both the ſame Date; Till it comes, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; and when it hath done, they have done with it; and from the Moment of its Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are in perfect Eaſe, and Tranquillity. And thus you ſee, how Man is rendred (rather indeed, how by his Miſmanagement, he renders Himſelf) the worſe for his Advantages; that the Happineſs and Privilege of his Nature, is become the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Occaſion of all his Miſery. And were it not better to have been born naked, than to be provided with<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <q>Did Nature, which furniſhed us with theſe Rich and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Accompliſhments, bring us under a Neceſſity of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to our own Sorrow and Ruine; the Gift, indeed, had been Treacherous, and Providence cruelly kind. But ſince they are not the Appetites, and Paſſions, and Facuties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the Exceſſes and Indulgings of the One, and the Neglect or Abuſe of the other, to which theſe Miſeries are owing, Let us not complain of our Condition, nor charge God fooliſhly; but put all that we ſuffer of this kind, to the Account of our own Follies and Vices. For from hence it is, that Brutes can pretend to enter into the Compariſon with us, even in the Eſteem of thoſe, whoſe Wiſh and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it is, to bring us down to their Level. And were not we by cheriſhing our reſtleſs Paſſions, ſo induſtrious to torment our ſelves, we ſhould not ſee, as now we daily do, that the Dull and Inſenſible live moſt at their Eaſe, and come off Cheaper with the Sufferings of Humane Life, than Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Another Advantage over Brutes,<note place="margin">Dominion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> which Man makes Pretenſions to, is that of <hi>Dominion,</hi> and Power to Command them, which he imagines to be veſted in him. But, (not to take notice at preſent, that This is but an improper Plea, ſince Men alſo mutually Command, and are Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one another) the Thing in Fact is not true: For where does our Practice and Experience ſhew this univerſal Command in Man, and as univerſal Subjection and Obedience in other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53648:161"/>'Tis plain in the preſent State of Things, that this is a mere Fancy; and that Men are much more in fear of Beaſts, than ſtood in fear of by them. It is not to be doubted, but this was once the Caſe; and an ample Commiſſion That was, which the Great Lord of the Univerſe iſſued at the Creation,<note place="margin">Gen 1.26.</note>

Nay, what mean thoſe Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Slaves, who ſell their Liberty for Summs of Money, or who part with it gladly and freely, or that Truck it away for ſome Conveniency? For was not all this done by the Ancient Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators? And is it not now done daily, by Women to their Ladies, and Soldiers to their Commanders? But Beaſts know nothing like this; they ſerve not one another; they neither enſlave, nor are enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by one another; but are in all reſpects

Nay, He is not murder'd and devour'd thus by Beaſts only, but (which is infinitely more) by another Man, his Equal, his Companion, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No Beaſts ever aſſemble themſelves in Troops, to deſtroy, and ravage, and lead Captive another Troop of the ſame Kind; but Men, to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reproach, not only do the thing, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, and triumph in the deſtruction of their own Species.</p>

Thus this Mind, with the Thoughts and value whereof Man is ſo much exalted, is the Occaſion of infinite Misfortunes; and of moſt of all then, when it exerts it ſelf moſt: For in all vehement Agitations, it does not only hurt and diſturb the Body, and render its Forces and Functions diſordered, and broken, and quite tired down; but it hinders and confounds its own ſelf: For what is it that throws Men into Folly and Madneſs, ſo much as the Acuteneſs, and Activity, and Strength of the Mind it ſelf? The ſubtileſt Follies, and moſt exquiſite Phrenſies proceed from the quickeſt, and ſineſt, and moſt vigorous Agitations of the Mind; as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the bittereſt Averſions, and moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Immities grow from the tendereſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and moſt intimate Friendſhips; and the moſt virulent and mortal Diſeſes, from a ſtrong Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and healthful Body.

And to a Man of nice and juſt Obſervation, it will appear, that when the Soul acts freely, and gives her ſelf a <hi>Looſe,</hi> there is none of her Altitudes and Sallies without a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Folly;</hi> and in good truth, theſe things dwell very cloſe together;

And That Man is deſervedly reputed <hi>Wiſe,</hi> who makes <hi>them</hi> his Pattern, and his Leſſon, and reaps Profit by <hi>their</hi> Example; by reforming and reducing himſelf to that Innocence, Simplicity, Liberty, Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs of Temper, which Nature had originally implante both in Us and Them: And, which in Brutes is ſtill very conſpicuous, but in Us is decay'd, chang'd, and utterly corrupted by our Induſtrious Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Artiſicial Depravations; thus debauching and abuſing the particular Prerogative we pretend to, and rendring our ſelves more vile than the Beaſts, by means of that very Underſtanding and Judgment, which ſets us ſo far above them.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in the Operations of the Reaſonable Soul, a great deal depends upon the Organs, and Diſpoſition of that Body to which it is joyned; and (as hath been already explain'd at large) more eſpecially upon the Brain: Now ſince Anatomiſts have not been able to obſerve any very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Differences between the Contexture of the Humane Brain, and that of Brutes; we are not to think it ſtrange, if there appear ſome ſmall Reſemblances in ſome particular Actions of Men and Beaſts, tho' theſe do not proceed from the ſame Principle of Motion; but owe their Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to that of the Body and <hi>Medium</hi> put into thoſe Motions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Impreſſions of external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have very ſtrong Effects upon the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Memory; and theſe, aſſiſted by Cuſtom, and Imitation, and Example, will perform many wonderful things, which yet are not the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> properly ſo called. Of this kind it is eaſie to obſerve great Number of Inſtances, in Them, who either by means of their <hi>Infancy,</hi> have not yet attain'd to the uſe of Reaſon; or Them, who by ſome Natural Defects never have it at all; or Others, who by ſome accidental Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance have loſt it: In all which Caſes, (not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53648:166"/>during the lucid Intervals only, or when the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Mind ſeem a little to be awakened, but even in the moſt profound Ignorance, or moſt raging Madneſs) Thoſe which are frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the Senſitive Faculties of the Soul, put forth ſometimes a marvellous Efficacy and Vigour. And that Theſe are moved entirely by material and ſenſible Objects, and act as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as any other Parts of <hi>Matter</hi> whatſoever, hath been the Opinion of many new Philoſophers; ſome of whom imagine, that all the Operations of this kind, are as capable of being reſolved by Principles of Mechaniſm, (thoſe Operations, I mean, of Imagination, and Memory, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom) as any other Affections and Motions of common <hi>Matter.</hi> How juſt this Concluſion is, I do not pretend to determine; for They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to confeſs it inſufficient, when they call in to their Aſſiſtance, another <hi>Principle,</hi> which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That of <hi>Inſtinct;</hi> By which is meant, a ſtrong Tendency, and Natural Impulſe (diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in theſe Creatures) to certain neceſſary and uſeful Actions. Something of a Principle implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them by their wiſe Creator, to qualiſie them for their own Preſervation, and the anſwering the Ends of his good Providence in Making them. And this appears ſo early, as to be plainly ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to either Memory or Fancy; and yet is ſo conſtant too, and always the ſame, in the ſame Circumſtances and Occaſions; as neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Cauſes ſo mutable as the Impreſſions of outward Objects, nor a Principle ſo caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the Choice of ſuch a Mind perfectly free feels in its Deliberations. And, as Inſtruments put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a skilful Hand, perform many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo aſtoniſhing, that a Man unexperienc'd in the Art, cou'd not poſſibly imagine ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53648:166"/>capable of them; ſo theſe Philoſophers conceive, that Almighty God, in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath ſo diſpoſed the Senſitive Parts of the Soul, that They by their wonderful Structure ſhall be adapted to moſt amazing Effects, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome Original Propenſions and Impulſes, independent from, and antecedent to the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Matter, or the power of Inſtitution and Cuſtom; which in the needful and moſt profitable Actions of Life, ſerve theſe Animals for Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles, and bear ſome kind of Affinity to the firſt common Notions, in the Rational and Intelligent Mind. And upon theſe Impulſes joyn'd to thoſe other Advantages mention'd before, the whole Oeconomy of Brutes, and even thoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſeem moſt exquiſite and admirable in any of them, have by the Modern Mechanick Philoſophers, been generally thought to depend. Concerning which, tho' almoſt every Syſtem treat in ſome meaſure, yet I believe my Reader (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Opinion incline to that Account or not) would at leaſt think himſelf well entertain'd upon this Subject, by the peruſal of our Learned and Ingeious Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> in the Sixth and Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Book <hi>De Animâ Brutorum.</hi>

                        <p>Two things are fit to be added upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with regard to what Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> hath deliver'd concerning <hi>Inſtinct:</hi> The firſt is, That in regard we obſerve theſe Animals conſtantly going on in the ſame beaten Track, and keeping ever cloſe to one Method; and even in thoſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have the greateſt Appearance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and Choice, of Ten Thouſand that make the ſame Experiment, or go about the ſame thing, not one varying from the common and received Way; This ſeems to be ſome <hi>Governing Principle</hi> in Nature, which gives a neceſſary Determination to them; and very different from that Liberty and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53648:167"/>Conſideration, which hath ſcarce any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, and demonſtrative Proof of the Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely unconſtrain'd in Mankind, than that Multiplicity of Opinions, and ſtrange Variety of Proceedings, obſervable upon Occaſions and Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, in themſelves extremely alike.</p>
                        <p>The Other Remark, Proper upon this Occaſion, is, that what our Author ſuggeſts here, is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence at all: as if too much Honour were done to theſe Creatures, and ſuch a Happy and Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Determination, to what is Profitable and Proper for them, were a Privilege, more than Humane; a nearer Approach to that unerring Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and unchangeable Goodneſs of the Divine Nature, than We our ſelves can boaſt of. For there is ſo very wide a Difference, between <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of acting; the One is ſo Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo truly Noble; the Other ſo Mean, ſo Slaviſh a Principle, that no Compariſon can be made between them. The moſt Glorious, moſt Beautiful, moſt Uſeful Parts of the Material Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are in this Reſpect, infinitely beneath the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Sons of Men; and all their other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages put together, cannot deſerve to be laid into the Balance againſt this Single Dignity, of Free and Spontaneous Action. And though the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine Nature, be indefectible and unalterable Goodneſs; yet would not even This be an Excellence, if it were not the Effect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Liberty. It is, indeed, Our Misfortune, that our Underſtandings are impoſed upon, our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions perverted; and ſo the Choice we have the uſe of, often determines us to the wrong Side, and entangles us in Errour and Vice. But Theſe Defects and Temptations are ſo many Clogs and Bars upon our Freedom; and therefore God, who is above any Poſſibility of ſuch falſe Determinations, is ſtill ſo much the more Free.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53648:167"/>For <hi>Freedom,</hi> does not conſiſt, in a Power of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Evil</hi> as well as <hi>Good</hi> (which is a Power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that never was, or can be, ſtrictly ſpeaking) but in being Self-moved, and Self-acted; ſo as to be the Diſpoſer of one's own Will, without any Compulſion or neceſſary Determination, from a foreign or external Principle; and only acting, as one is acted upon. If then this Inſtinct in Brutes, be a Matter of <hi>Force,</hi> and Neceſſary Determination, they are in no Degree, the Better or more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for it; but under a fatal Conſtraint, which is ſo far from reſembling the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that it admits of no Virtue, nor ought to be eſteemed any Excellence, but the direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us obſerve, what mighty Difference there is, between the <hi>Perceptions</hi> of Brutes, and thoſe of Men; ſo great, that in them we find no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of any, but ſuch as are Material, and Single Objects; and what this Author advances, as Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and Inferences from thence, are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably aſſign'd by Others, to the Force of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or the Strength of Memory, or to thoſe Natural Impreſſions, which commonly go by the Name of <hi>Inſtinct.</hi> To the latter of Theſe we find very Learned Men, attributing that uniform Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Birds, and Bees, and Ants, in their Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Generation, Production, and the like. To the Former, that which <hi>Charron</hi> terms deducing an <hi>Univerſal</hi> from a <hi>Singular,</hi> and knowing by the having ſeen one Man, how to Diſtinguiſh the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Form, in any, or all Individuals of the ſame Species. But, ſuppoſing we ſhould allow, that this proceeds from a diſtinguiſhing Faculty, and not meerly from the refreſhing and awaking an Image, that lay dormant in the Memory, 'till revived by this freſh Object; yet what Proportion can even thus much bear, to all thoſe Abſtracted Idea's by
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53648:168"/>which Men diſtinguiſh the Natures and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Things? If a Brute, from the Sight of a Man, could collect ſo much as ſhould ſerve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriminate all other Men from Creatures of a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species; yet what is This in Compariſon of that Penetration, which examines into the Abſtruſe Cauſes, and eſſential Differences of Things, and informs it ſelf diſtinctly, wherein that very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our Nature, which we call <hi>Humanity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts? And what account can there be given of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny univerſal or abſtracted Idea's in Beaſts? of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe, which we properly call <hi>Reaſonable Actions?</hi> For as to theſe ſeeming Demurrs, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Compariſons, which we find inſtanced in here, and in other Places, it is uſual to obſerve as much, in Children ſo little, and Naturals ſo wretchedly Stupid, as that there are but very Faint, if any Glimpſes at all, of <hi>Underſtanding</hi> in them. I know, indeed,<note place="margin">S. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Monſieur Charron,</hi> hath provided a Reply to this Argument, by ſaying, That we cannot have any competent Knowledge of Their Internal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. But though we do not ſee all the hidden Movements of their Souls, nor can diſtinctly ſay, whether they are <hi>feeble Reaſoners</hi> or <hi>Stupendous Machines;</hi> yet we may be very confident, they cannot dive into the Cauſes, and abſtracted Idea's of Things; becauſe there do not appear the leaſt Foot-ſteps, or any of thoſe Noble Effects, of ſuch Knowledge, which Mankind have in all Ages been conſpicuous for. For to theſe abſtracted Notions it is, that all the amazing Inventions and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Arts and Sciences; but eſpecially the Wonders of <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> by Numbers and Proportions Duly adjuſted, owe their Birth and daily Growth. And ſince in the Diſtinction and Perception of Concrete Bodies, where Senſation is chiefly concern'd, the Brutes are acknowledged to equal, if not exceed Us, in Accuracy; it is not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53648:168"/>to be conceived, that They who excel in a Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is commenſurate to a Senſitive Soul, ſhould be able to give No Marks at all of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with a Capacity of entertaining and feeding upon thoſe Ideas, which are the Peculiar Prerogatives, and Glories, of a Rational one.</p>
                        <p>Much more might be added upon this Occaſion, with Regard both to the Objects themſelves; and the particular Manner of Conception; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Diſparities of the Humane Intellect, and that Faculty, which is affected in Brutes. But it is Prejudice ſufficient againſt them, that ſo many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wiſe and Inquiſitive Perſons have found Cauſe, to do even ſomething more than doubt, whether Brutes be better than a ſort of <hi>Divine Clock-Work;</hi> and have any manner of Senſe or Perception at all. This, at leaſt, was never aſſerted of Man; nor the Powers and Operations of his Reaſoning Soul diſputed, (as to the Reality of them,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by ſuch as ſet up for <hi>Univerſal Scepticiſm,</hi> and are for reducing all to a State of Confuſion and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. And therefore if, becauſe Brutes ſeem to act by a Faculty, which we cannot perfectly account for, we ſhould allow, to theſe Brutes, ſome few dusky Glimmerings of Reaſon (which yet there is no abſolute Neceſſity for, becauſe they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it) yet no Impartial Conſiderer, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit, that it will bear a Queſtion, whether They, or We, have the Better of this Point; or that <hi>Some Men, excel others, more than ſome again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Beaſts;</hi> for there is no Man, how mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught ſoever, if provided with what we call <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe,</hi> but ſinds an Ability in himſelf, nay, exerciſes that Ability every Day, (even when he does not know, or think of it) of conſidering, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, and determining in ſuch a manner, as no good Arguments have ever yet been offered to ſhew that Beaſts either do, or can do. They are juſtly
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53648:169"/>thought to do ſomewhat very extraordinary, when by long Cuſtom, and ſevere Diſcipline, and daily Example and Inſtruction, brought to imitate ſome very common Actions of Men; But what Divine Heights do Men themſelves aſcend to, when they have proportionable Pains taken with Them? And here in Juſtice the Compariſon ought to lie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Beſt</hi> of each Kind; not the <hi>Beſt</hi> of One, and the <hi>Loweſt</hi> of the Other; the moſt unapt and neglected of Men, and the moſt teachable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of Brutes: For the Advantages, or the Want of <hi>Art,</hi> cannot at all affect the Diſpute, where the Gifts of <hi>Nature</hi> are the Matter in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: And theſe are diſtributed with ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even a Hand, in the Caſe before us; that He muſt be either very Stupid, or very Perverſe, who does not ſee the mighty Diſproportion.</p>
                        <p>As to the other Part of this Diſcourſe, whether <hi>Reaſon</hi> be any <hi>Real Benefit,</hi> and we might not have been as well, or better without it; I ſhall only need to add, that the ſeveral Inſtances, produced here, are only ſuch as are Sad and very Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Truths, in Regard of thoſe Abuſes of Reaſon, Men are Guilty of; and the wicked, or the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Purpoſes they pervert it to: But as to the Thing it ſelf, they are no more a Reflection upon it, than the Surfeits and Beſtiality of Gluttons, and Sots, are upon the common Refreſhments of Life. What is ſaid upon this Occaſion, will do well indeed to be conſidered, by thoſe vicious and indiſcreet Men, who apply That as a <hi>Spur</hi> to their Wickedneſs, and Paſſion, which was intended for a <hi>Curb</hi> to both; And the World ought to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and reformed by a ſerious Reflection, how Acceſſory Men become to their own Miſeries, and how obſtinately fond they are of them, when their very <hi>Remedies</hi> are induſtriouſly turned into the worſt of <hi>Diſeaſes:</hi> But, All this Notwithſtanding, <hi>Monſieur
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53648:169"/>Charron</hi>'s Argument here, is abundantly refuted by himſelf, in the laſt Words of this whole Treatiſe, where he vindicates the Honour of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> from the miſchievous Effects, which ſome ill-deſigning Men, apply it to, by this Parallel: <q>For (ſays he) even That <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> which is the Peculiar <hi>Prerogative of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> and ſets us above Brutes, is moſt miſerably abus'd; turn'd againſt God, and our ſelves; and made the Occaſion of our more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable Ruine. But, This is only an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Misfortune; far from the Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſo Noble a Privilege. And He, who would argue from hence, that Mankind had better want theſe Faculties, may juſtly ſeem to have degenerated into Brute; and to be quite forſaken of all that Reaſon, which he ſo Wildly and ſo raſhly condemns.</q> So juſt Ground is there for reading this Treatiſe, with thoſe Cautions to be laid down upon the <hi>XXXVIIth Chapter;</hi> and ſo truly does our Author, keep up his Character, of an <hi>Academick Philoſopher.</hi>

There is not any One Caſe, in which Men are more apt to be wanting, nor where their Failings are of more Dangerous Conſequence, for the involving them in new and infinite Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. The Mean, and the Ignorant, the Worldling, and the Man of Pleaſure; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, all that do not, or cannot conſider, prize <hi>Life</hi> extravagantly: They look upon it, as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good,</hi> and prefer it ſo much before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things, as not to admit a Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. If Life were to be ſold at a Price; nay, if a ſhort Reprieve only, and Lengthening out their Term a little, can be had, they can think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too Dear, no Conditions too hard, to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to; but are ſatisfied the purchaſe ought to be made at any Rate. For This, they tell you, is their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>when That is gone, All is gone;</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:53648:170"/>their very Motto is, <hi>Nothing more precious than Life. (Vitâ nihil charius)</hi> They value and love it, not only as the Scene of Action and Enjoyment, and upon the account of the Conveniences and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities it affords, but upon its own ſuppoſed intrinſick worth; and live merely for the ſake of Living. And how can we think it ſtrange, that ſuch Perſons ſhould be ſo very defective in the reſt of their Duty, ſo miſ-led with Errours, and extravagant Notions, when they make the very firſt Step wrong, and ſet out in ſo groſs a Miſtake, concerning this great Fundamental Article of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue?</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a Contempt of <hi>Life,</hi> that declines as much to Vice in the other Extreme, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it as a Burden, or a Trifle; Worth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or Worſe than Nothing: But this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing is the effect of Weakneſs and Ignorance, of Pride and Ingratitude. For we know very well, that when it falls into Wiſe and Good Hands, it is capable of becoming an Inſtrument of great and general uſe, both to our ſelves, and to others. Now I can by no means be of Their Opinion, taken literally and plainly, who give it out for their Princple, That<note n="*" place="bottom">Optimum non naſci; aut quam citiſſimè aboleri.</note> 
                        <hi>the greateſt Happineſs is, Not to live at all; and the next moſt deſirable thing is to live but a very little while.</hi> Nor is that Argument they uſe in vindication of this Opinion, at all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or Satisfactory: What Hurt (ſay they) could there be in <hi>Non-Exiſtence?</hi> and what Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it been, if I were never created? To This one may reply with Reaſon enough, What do you make of all the Happineſs you have enjoy'd? What would become of This, if you had had <hi>no Being?</hi> And would it not have been ſome Matter, ſome
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53648:171"/>Hurt never to have enjoy'd it? For certainly, tho' the loſs of the Good which we have, and know the worth of, be a more ſenſible Evil; yet the mere privation of Good, and never having it at all, is One ſort of Evil too; even tho' that Good be ſuch as we ſhou'd never have miſſed, nor ſuch as was neceſſary to us. Theſe Extremes are too wide; they overſtrain the Point on both ſides, and degenerate into Vice; tho' they are not equally vicious and erroneous neither.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, ſpeaking in the Quality of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and with regard to the preſent State of Aſſairs only; I do not think That Wiſe Ancient much out of the way, who acknowledged<note n="†" place="bottom">Vitam nemo acciperet, ſi daretur ſcientibus.</note> 
                        <hi>Life to be Good; but ſuch a Good, as no Man would accept of, if it were left to his own free Choice, and he were fairly inform'd beforehand, what Incumbrances lay upon it.</hi> It is not at all amiſs, that we are engaged in it, before we know what it is: We come into the World blindfold; but That is no reaſon why Men ſhou'd afterwards put out their own Eyes, or hoodwink themſelves. For the Miſchief is, that, when we are got hither, we run into different Ways: Some cheat themſelves into ſo extravagant a Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Life, that they wou'd not part with it again at any rate. Others fret themſelves into ſo ill an Opinion of it, that they grumble eternally, are diſcontented at every thing, and pretend to be weary, and ſick of Living. But Wiſe Men have juſter Notions of the Matter; They conſider that this was a Bargain made without their Knowledge or Conſent; (for no Man lives, or dies, aſſoon, or as late, or in ſuch Manner and Circumſtances, as he pleaſes himſelf) But ſtill it is a Bargain we are bound to ſtand to; and if it be a hard one,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53648:171"/>we muſt try to make the beſt of it. Sometimes we ſhall meet with Rough Ways; but the whole Paſſage is not ſo: And therefore Philoſophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the beſt Courſe is to create no Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, nor ſtruggle and flounder unprofitably, but for Men to ſuit their Tempers, and comply with their Circumſtances as well as they can; to carry it off with Evenneſs and Moderation, and make a <hi>Virtue of Neceſſity;</hi> for That is the Character of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Good Management: And when they have fixed themſelves in this Method, then to live as long as is Fit for them, conſiſtent with their Duty, and Decency: Not as long as is Poſſible for them, which is the Principle of fooliſh and profligate People. For there is a Seaſon proper for Dying, as well as one for Living; and a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Honourable Death is a Thouſand time; rather to be choſen, than a Wicked and Infamous Life. Now a Wiſe and Good Man makes it his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to live juſt ſo long as Life is better than Death, and no longer: For, as we obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that They are in the Wrong, who eſteem the ſhorteſt Life beſt; ſo is that common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Miſtake too, which raiſes the Value by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Years, and accounts that Life beſt which laſts longeſt.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Shortneſs of that Term allow'd us in this World, is a great and a general Complaint:<note place="margin">Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> of Life.</note> We meet it in every Mouth; not from the Ignorant and Vulgar only, where we cannot expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that They ſhould be willing to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; but (which may be allow'd a little to ſurprize us) even Great Souls, and Wiſe Men, reckon it among their very greateſt Unhappineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now to ſay the very Truth, as Men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manage the Matter, and indeed as Nature hath in ſome meaſure contriv'd it, Life is very ſhort; For the greateſt part of it is employed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53648:172"/>otherwiſe; and a very ſmall Proportion left for the true Uſes and Ends of Living. The Time of our Infancy and Ignorance, the Decays and Infirmities of Old Age, the neceſſary Intervals of Sleep, the Diſeaſes of our Bodies and our Minds, and the infinite other void Spaces of it, wherein we are incapable of doing Good, run away with a great deal of our Time: And when the Whole is ſumm'd up, and theſe Abatements made, the Remainder is not much. But yet, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves with the Contrary Opinion, which aſſerts the Shortneſs of Life to be greatly for our Advantage, we ſhall find Reaſon enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this Complaint of Injuſtice; and to think it more the effect of Inconſideration and Ill-Nature, than of good Arguing, and Virtuous Diſpoſition. For what Advantage would a longer Life be to us? Shall we wiſh for it to no other purpoſe, but merely to Live in; to take our Eaſe, to Eat, and Drink, and Sleep, to Look about us, and ſee more of the World? What need is there of ſo much Time for this? We have already ſeen, and known, and taſted what we are capable of, in a very little time; and when we are got to the End of our Curioſity, This is ſufficient. What Good will it do us, or wherefore ſhould we wiſh to act the ſame things over and over again, and be always beginning afreſh? Who would not be cloyed with eating upon the ſame Diſh every Day? If this be not nauſeous and troubleſome, yet to be ſure it is ſuperfluous and unneceſſary. This is but One Circle, which is perpetually rolling, and brings the ſame things uppermoſt again; ſometimes they remove to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance, and then they quickly return back upon us: Tis but a ſpinning the ſame Web; and That which may ſerve a Child to play with, but can never be a ſit Entertainment for grown Men.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53648:172"/>Shall we then wiſh it for nobler Ends; that we may grow Wiſer and Better, and aſpire to higher degrees of Virtue and Perfection; that we may do more Good, and be more uſeful in our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? This indeed carries the Appearance of an excellent Diſpoſition; but They that know us, will not be impoſed upon by it: For Who ſhall teach, Who ſhall improve us? Alas! That Little which is committed to our Truſt, is ſo ill uſed, that we cannot have the Confidence to ask for more. We neglect what we have already, and ſuffer the greateſt part of it to ſlip thro' our Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. We ſquander it away profuſely upon Vanity and Trifles; nay, we abuſe and miſemploy it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wickedneſs and Vice. And yet after all this Unfaithfulneſs and Folly, we cry and complain for more, and think our ſelves ill dealt with, that we have not enough. Enough for What? For the ſame inſignificant and ill purpoſes to be ſure; for That wou'd be the Conſequence of a more liberal Allowance too. But, ſuppoſing Men ſerious in this Matter; and that they wou'd really do as they pretend; yet of what Uſe wou'd this vaſt Treaſure of Knowledge and Experience prove? For the Soul muſt change its Dwelling at one time or other; and whenever That diſlodges, all our Wiſdom goes with it. Since therefore This cannot ſtay always, why ſhou'd we take it ill that it ſtays ſo little a time? For if it ſink into a ſtate of Oblivion, and all muſt be loſt, What mighty difference is there, whether this be done ſooner or later? But if it removes into a better Condition, and be (as it really will be) put into a ſtate of clearer Viſion, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge, why ſhould we deſire to have that Happineſs delayed, and kept back from us?</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, perhaps, This <hi>Gift of Life</hi> is very unequally diſtributed; for there are ſome
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53648:173"/>Creatures, that live Three, Four times as long, as the uſual Age of Man. I might anſwer, That the Accounts we have of this kind are many, if not moſt of them, fabulous. But waving That, and allowing the Objection; yet it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed withal, that Some, nay the much greater part of Animals live not near ſo long; ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive at a Fourth part of our Years, and very few ever come to an equal length with us. Now pray, what Right, what Privilege, what Reaſon hath Man to challenge a longer Duration here, than the reſt of his Fellow-Creatures have a Title to? Where did God ever grant him ſuch a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or how will he be able to make good the Claim? Is it reaſonable He ſhould be indulg'd more than They, becauſe he puts out his Time to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Intereſt, and employs it upon Buſineſs more noble and ſublime in it ſelf, more worthy and deſerving of this Favour, than They are capable of? I greatly fear, This Argument may be thrown back in our Faces, and prove the ſtrongeſt Plea againſt us: For ſure He ought rather to be cut ſhorter than the Reſt, as a Puniſhment for his Abuſe and Miſmanagement. And in This he is ſingular, and ſtands alone. The whole Creation cannot furniſh a Parallel; not any one Inſtance of this Bleſſing ſo grievouſly perverted, not ſuch another <hi>Monſter</hi> of Wickedneſs and Unfaithfulneſs, of Ingratitude and Baſeneſs, of Intemperance and Debauchery, and all manner of Diſorderly Living. This <hi>Charge</hi> hath been ſufficiently proved upon him already, when we ſtated the Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Him and the Beaſts; and therefore I urge my Point, and ask that Queſtion once more, What Benefit wou'd a longer Life be to him? Nay, I back that with a Second, and add, What an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience would it be to Himſelf, and how miſchievous to the World? It would make his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53648:173"/>own Account the heavier, his Crimes and Arrears the greater, and it wou'd encourage him to yet more Extravagancies than he is guilty of already: For this very Conſideration would put him upon bolder and more deſperate Attempts. The ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Continuance in the World, as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now ſtand, is ſome Check to his wild Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and breaks all his Meaſures; and the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it abates and damps his Fury: But if theſe Reſtraints were removed, and Aſſurances gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a larger Term, Nothing would be able to ſtop him; his Projects would be always New, without Number, without End; and he would <hi>live</hi> as if he were to <hi>live for ever.</hi> You ſee how ſtrong theſe Inclinations are now. He cannot but feel and fear his own Mortality; and yet theſe Reflections are ſo over-balanc'd by a corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within, that he cannot forbear holding faſt what he hath, and eager Deſires and Purſuits of what he hath not, and forming vaſt and very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Deſigns, as if he were really Immortal.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tanquam ſemper victuri vivitis.

                     </p>
                     <p>Again; What neceſſity is there for all thoſe great and goodly Deſigns, and that mighty Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is pretended to merit a <hi>longer Life</hi> for Mankind, than any other Animal? Does Nature require more back than is given us? No ſure.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53648:174"/>Men have no juſt ground of Complaint; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Cauſe for Indignation and Remorſe, for treating themſelves no better. The <hi>Life</hi> allow'd us is enough to anſwer All the Purpoſes of it; but the Miſery is, that we turn Negligent and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, and do not husband it ſo well as we might and ought to do: It is not ſhort of it ſelf, but we make it ſo, by waſting it unproſitably. We labour under no Wants of this kind, but what our own Prodigality brings upon us; and are ſcandalouſly laviſh of the Thing we pretend to need moſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non inopes vitae, ſed prodigi.</note> We loſe it, we ſell it, we throw it away; we vilifie it, and complain that it hangs upon our Hands; we are at ſome pains to paſs it away, as if it were a Matter of no Worth at all; as if our Stomachs were over-loaded, and we ſick and cloy'd with too great Abundance.

                        <hi>A great part of our Life</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>is run off in doing what we ſhould not; much the greateſt in doing nothing at all; and almoſt the whole of it in doing things by the by, and ſuch as are not our proper Buſineſs.</hi> No body takes pains in learning how to Live; but All lay out their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and their Time upon any other Subject, rather than This. And yet This, like all other Arts, is not to be attained ſlightly and eaſily; a Man cannot be expert in it without long Practice, much Diligence, and very ſollicitous Application of the Mind.

How are they ſure they ſhall live to that Age? But if they were, what a wretched Madneſs is This?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>Life</hi> of Man hath its Inconveniences and Miſeries of ſeveral ſorts. Some of them are in Common; extending to all Perſons, and all Times; Others are Peculiar and Succeſſive, and diſtinguiſh'd by the different Parts, and Age, and particular Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Accidents of Life: As Childhood, Youth, Maturity, Man's Eſtate, and Old Age; for Each of theſe hath its diſtinct Calamities; ſome Embaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Incumbrances, which may be properly call'd its own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> When <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Old Age</hi> come to be weigh'd one againſt the other, <note place="margin">Youth and Age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</note> it hath been uſual to give the Advantage to the Latter: And moſt Authors ſpeak of Age with Honour and Reſpect, as having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to greater degrees of Wiſdom, more maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Judgment, more Moderation and Temper: All which good Qualities are marvellouſly cry'd up, with a Deſign to put Youth out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to charge upon it the contrary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Vice and Folly, Licentiouſneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance. But with the leave of thoſe, who have thus decided the Controverſie, I muſt take Liberty to declare, that this Verdict is in my Opinion very unjuſt: For, in good truth, the Defects and the Vices of Age are More in Number, Worſe in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and leſs to be reſiſted or recover'd, than thoſe that are peculiar to Youth. Years deform our Minds as much as our Bodies; bring Wrinkles there as well as in our Faces, and turn our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53648:175"/>ſour and mouldy with long keeping. The Soul keeps pace with the Body; Both are ſpent, and Both decay, till at laſt we grow ſo weak, ſo perfectly helpleſs, as in reſpect of both, to verifie that Proverb, of <hi>Old Men</hi> being <hi>twice Children. Age</hi> is a neceſſary, but a ſtrong Diſeaſe; it loads us inſenſibly with grievous Imperfections, and then contrives to cover the Shame of them with credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Names. What is in effect no other than Moroſeneſs of Humour, a peeviſh diſlike of the preſent Enjoyments, and Diſability to do as the Man did heretofore, paſſes for Wiſdom and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Experience, and an Inſight into the Vanity of the World. But Wiſdom is ſomewhat much more noble than all this comes to, and far above making uſe of ſuch mean Inſtruments. There is a vaſt difference between <hi>growing older</hi> and <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſer;</hi> between forſaking all Vice, and the changing one for another; and, as it often happens in this Caſe, changing for the Worſe. Old Age condemns the Pleaſures and Gayeties of Youth; but how much of this muſt be allowed to its not being now able to reliſh them any longer? It is like <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Dog, hates and deſpiſes what it cannot enjoy. But This is not to diſdain and give over Pleaſure; it is rather to be diſdain'd and given over by it. Pleaſure is always Airy and Entertaining; and theſe are Perſons no longer for its Turn. But why ſhould they caſt a Reflection upon That, which is due to themſelves? Why ſhou'd Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence corrupt their Judgment? For this, if impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſulted, would tell Young Men, that there is Vice in their Pleaſures; and Old Men, that there is Pleaſure in Vice. And if this were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, and frankly confeſt, Youth would be a great deal the better, and Old Age not one whit the worſe.</p>

                     <p> The Vices more peculiar to <hi>Youth</hi> are, Raſhneſs and Heat; Forwardneſs, and an unguarded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; Debauchery, and all manner of Senſual Exceſs. And theſe are in ſome Degree natural to that State; the Effects of Warmth and Vigour, and the Boylings of a Florid Blood: All which, as they need and ought to be corrected, ſo they have ſomething to ſay in their own Excuſe. But what Apology ſhall we make for the Ill Qualities that attend <hi>Old Age?</hi> The lighteſt and leaſt of which are vain Arrogance and Pride; a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and peremptory way of Converſing, and an engroſſing all the Talk to themſelves; froward and unſociable Humours, Superſtition and Whimſie; Love of Riches when paſt the uſe of them; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Avarice, and Fear of Death; which generally is not (as ſome have favourably interpreted the Caſe) the effect of a cold Blood, and low Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and of Courage damp'd by theſe Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but it proceeds from long Cuſtom, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and a fooliſh Fondneſs for the World; by which the Old Gentleman hath corrupted his Judgment, and hath a greater Tenderneſs for it, than young Men, who enjoy more, and know leſs of it. Beſides theſe, there are Envy, and Ill-Nature, and Injuſtice; but the moſt exquiſite and ridiculous Folly of all, is, that Affectation of a ſevere, and grave, and wiſe Character; and hoping to gain Reſpect and Deference, by an Auſtere Look, and Scornful Behaviour; which indeed does but provoke Laughter, and become it ſelf a Jeſt, while it pretends to extort Obſervance and Fear: For the Young Fellows combine together againſt this formal Auſterity, which they ſee put on on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Diſguiſe; and with a deſign to amuſe and affright them into Reverence, where real Merit, which would engage it, is wanting. In ſhort, The Vices of Old Age are ſo numerous
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53648:176"/>on the One Hand, and the Infirmities of it on the Other, and Both together conſpire to render it ſo deſpicable, that the beſt and moſt ſaving Game it can play, is to ſecure Mens Affections, and to win them by Methods of Kindneſs, and Affability, and Good-Nature. For Churliſhneſs, and an Imperious Humour, and whatever aims at Fear and Dominion, are not by any means Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons fit for Theſe Perſons to manage. The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſo very much Awe, does by no means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; and if the thing could really be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed (which it rarely, or never is) yet they ſhould much rather chooſe to render themſelves Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and think the Love, and Reſpect, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of young Perſons, more to be deſired, than the keeping them in Conſtraint and Fear, and Tyrannizing over all that converſe with them.</p>

For they All conſpire to paint him, as a Creature made up of theſe Four Things; <hi>Vanity, Weakneſs, Inconſtancy,</hi> and <hi>Miſery.</hi> They ſtyle him <hi>The Prey of Time; The Sport and Geugaw of Fortune; The Image of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; The Pattern,</hi> nay rather <hi>the Prodigy of Weakneſs; The Balance of Envy and Miſery; a Dream;</hi> a <hi>Phantome; Duſt and Aſhes;</hi> a <hi>Vapour;</hi> a <hi>Morning-Dow;</hi> a <hi>Flower that preſently fadeth; in the Morning Green and growing up, in the Evening cut down, dry'd up, and withered;</hi> a <hi>Wind; Graſs;</hi> a <hi>Bubble;</hi> a <hi>Shadow;</hi> a <hi>Leaf born away by the Wind;</hi> a <hi>Sponge

Job,</hi> who was as well skilled, and as much experienc'd in this Subject, as any Man ever was, hath drawn him at full Length, in his true Colours and Proportions: And <hi>Solomon</hi> after Him hath done the ſame in His Books. <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Piece of him is <hi>in Little,</hi> but extremely like the Original, when he calls him<note n="*" place="bottom">Solum ut certum ſit nihil eſſe certi, nec miſerius quicquam homine aut ſuperbius.</note> The moſt wretched, and yet the proudeſt and moſt inſolent Creature in the whole World. Under the Former of theſe Attributes, (That of Wretched) he comprehends all the Characters already mention'd, and the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions other Writers have given of him. The Second (That of Proudeſt) concerns another Head of very great Conſideration; and in theſe Two Words he ſeems to have comprized all that can be ſaid upon the Matter. Theſe Two Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I confeſs, ſeem utterly inconſiſtent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of each other. For what in Appearance more diſtant, what more Contradictious, than Emptineſs and Preſumption, than Miſery and Pride? So ſtrange, ſo monſtrous a Compoſition is <hi>Man,</hi> in which theſe wide Extremes are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>
                  <p>Now the very different parts, whereof Man conſiſts, Body and Spirit, make it exceeding hard to give a tolerable Deſcription of him entire, and altogether. Some charge all that can be ſpoken in diſparagement of Man, upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and repreſent him a moſt excellent Creature,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53648:178"/>complete and ſuperiour to any other, in regard of his Mind. But this Method is ſo far from Juſt, that on the contrary, All that is truly Ill, not in Man only, but in the whole World, is the Product and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Mind. And much the greateſt part of the Vanity, Inconſtancy, Miſery, and Preſumption, with which Humane Nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, reſides in this part of us; which gave <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> occaſion to call the Mind <hi>An unknown World of Miſeries;</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> proves it by a Tract written on purpoſe, and upon this very Subject.

For, whether we regard Moral Evil, or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, or Inconſtancy, or Irreſolution, or any other ill Property, (of which, God knows, this Soil always bears a plentiful Crop) yet it abounds in nothing ſo much, as in Worthleſſneſs, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs; Senſeleſs Folly, and Ridiculous Vanity. Upon this Account <hi>Democritus,</hi> was certainly more in the Right, when he laughed at all Mankind, and treated them with Scorn, and Contempt, than <hi>Heraclitus</hi> was, who wept and afflicted himſelf; and ſo expreſt ſome ſort of Eſteem for Men, as if he thought them worth his Trouble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. And <hi>Diogenes</hi> took a better Courſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and diſdaining them, than <hi>Timon</hi> did, who profeſt to hate Mankind, and fled away from all Converſation. <hi>Pindar</hi> hath given a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Image of This, than any Author beſides, in that bold Stroke, where he hath joyned the Two Vaineſt Things in the World together, to finiſh his Idea, calling <hi>Man</hi> the <hi>Dream of a Shadow.</hi> This Conſideration hath driven ſome wiſe Men to ſo very great a Contempt of Humane Nature, that when a Difficult, Bold and Noble Undertaking was mentioned to them, they would frequently reply; That all the World was not worth a Man's giving himſelf any Trouble for it, (ſo ſaid <hi>Statilius</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Vanity hath great variety of Ways to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it ſelf by. As,<note place="margin">Vanity of the Thoughts.</note> Firſt of all, In our Thoughts, and ſecret Conferences with our Selves, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, even Worſe than Vain, Frivolous, and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. And yet in theſe trifling Imaginations we ſpend a great deal of Time, and are not ſenſible of it. We enter upon them, continue in them, and come out of them again, without ever being conſcious of our Motions: Which makes the Vanity double, and argues great Inadvertency, and Diſregard of our ſelves. Here is one walking in his Dining-Room full of Care to manage his Feet ſo, that each Turn may be compaſſed with ſuch a Number of Steps, and that ſuch Parts of the Boards only may be trod upon: A Second forms with great ſeriouſneſs long Harangues to himſelf, compoſes a Scene of Action, what he would ſay, and how he would maintain his Port, if he were a King, or a Pope, or ſome other Thing, which he is ſo far from, that he knows it is impoſſible he ever ſhould be ſuch. And thus he feeds upon Wind, nay, upon ſomewhat yet leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, upon a Thing that never had, nor ever will have, any ſort of Exiſtence. Another is taken up in contrivance for the Management of his Perſon, the Affecting a particular Motion of his Body, an Air of his Face, a Singularity of Addreſs, odd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and uncommon Pronunciations; and This he is inſinitely delighted with, as a Thing extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graceful and engaging, and what other People muſt needs admire, and be taken with too. Then how prodigiouſly vain and fooliſh are we in our
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53648:179"/>Wiſhes and Deſires; from whence ſpring our ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Opinions, and our yet more ridiculous Hopes and Expectations? And This again, not only at ſuch times as we ſurfeit with Leiſure, and have no other Buſineſs to employ our Thoughts; but it very often interrupts our ſerious and moſt important Affairs, and breaks our Thread in the very heat of Action. So <hi>Natural</hi> is <hi>Vanity</hi> to us, and ſo <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> over us, that it Spirits us away, and pluck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ſtretch our Deſires and Affections, beyond our Perſons and Subſiſtence; and are much concerned for things to be done to us, when we ſhall be in no capacity of receiving them. How importunately do we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Praiſe, and Applauſe after Death? and how egregious a Folly is This? What can be vainer? This is not Ambition, as Men may be apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; for That deſires a Senſible Honour, ſuch as a Man can enjoy, and reap ſome Benefit from. So far as our good Name indeed is capable of doing Service to our Children, or Relations, or Friends, that ſtay behind, I own there is uſe of it; and am content Men ſhould deſire it in proportion to this Convenience. But to propoſe That, as Our Own Happineſs, which can never reach, or in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree affect our ſelves, is meer Vanity. Such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Folly is Theirs, who perplex their Lives with Fears of their Wives marrying ſecond Husbands; and paſſionately deſire they would continue ſingle; nay, are content to purchaſe the Gratification of this Whimſie, at a dear Rate, by leaving in their Wills great part of their Eſtates to their Widows, upon this Condition. What an inſupportable Folly? and,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53648:180"/>as it ſometimes falls out, what horrible Injuſtice is This? How directly the Reverſe of thoſe Heroick Spirits in former Ages, who upon their Death-Beds advis'd their Wives to Marry again, as ſoon as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Prudence would permit; and to render Themſelves uſeful by bringing Children to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? Some again, Conjure their Friends to wear ſuch a Ring, or a Lock of Hair, or ſome other Relick, as a conſtant Remembrance of them, when they are dead; or leave Directions for ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing to be done about their own Bodies; What can we make of all This? hath it not a very untoward Aſpect? Methinks it looks, as if Men could be content to part with <hi>Life;</hi> but could not even then ſubmit to part with <hi>Vanity,</hi> at any Rate.</p>

We are not half ſo much concern'd what we really and truly are in our own Perſons and Diſpoſitions, as what the World takes us for, and how we ſtand in Character and Reputation abroad. And thus we frequently Cheat our ſelves, and caſt away the true Happineſs, and Advantages of Life, and do a Thouſand inconvenient Things; Tho' at the ſame time we Torture our ſelves to be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Standers-by, and to put on what we know is moſt in Vogue.

Men often teaze and torment themſelves more, for Matters of little or no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, than for Thoſe which are of neareſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and upon which their All depends. Our Soul is frequently thrown into violent Diſorders, by little Whimſies, a meer Fanſie, a Dream, a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and empty Amuſement, without Subſtance, without Ground; and works it ſelf up to all the Exceſſes of Anger and Revenge, Joy and Grief, and Confuſion; and all This with building Caſtles in the Air. The Ceremony of taking leave, the Idea of ſome particular Geſture in a parting Friend, ſtrikes us deeper, and gives us more real Trouble, than all the Reaſoning in the World, upon Matters of greateſt Moment, is able to do. The Sound of a Name repeated, ſome certain Words and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Accents pronounc'd Pathetically; nay, dumb Sighs, and vehement Exclamations, go to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hearts.

And here, what Vanity, what loſs of Time
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53648:181"/>may we obſerve in the Impertinencies of Viſits, Howd'you's, Forms of Addreſs, mutual Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; In the Offices of Civility, ſet Speeches, and Ceremonious Behaviour; in Proſſers of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in Promiſes, and Praiſes? How many fulſome Strains of Complement, what Infinite Hypocriſy, Falſhood and Deceit? How open and barefac'd, ſo that the Perſon that utters it, and he to whom it is directed, and every one that ſtands by, ſees and knows, and is ſatisfied it is Falſe? Thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is now become little elſe, than a Tryal of Skill for Diſſimulation; and looks like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Confederacy, where Men have combin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to lye, and bubble, and abuſe, and make a Jeſt of one another. Nay, good Manners require, that at the ſame time a Man tells you an impudent Lye, you ſhould return him your Thanks, for what you know he intends not a word of; and He again, who is ſatisfied you believe not a Syllable of what he ſays, receives thoſe Acknowledgments of yours with a ſet Face, and an Air of Confidence; and thus you ſtand cringing, and fawning, and dodging for the laſt Word; each ſtriving to begin, and fearing to leave off, and ſhrugging, when both are heartily weary, and would fain be well quit of one another. What Inconveniences are we content to endure for theſe Formalities? We expoſe our Selves to the Air, to Heat, to Cold; diſturb the Peace of our Lives, and are in perpetual Pain for theſe courtly Follies; We neglect our Buſineſs of Weight and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and attend upon Wind and Smoke. We are vain at the Expence of our Eaſe, nay, of our Health, of our very Life. And what can prove Mankind more enſlav'd to <hi>Vanity</hi> than This, That <hi>Levity</hi> and Accident tramples <hi>Subſtance</hi> under Foot, and Air carries away ſolid Body, whither it will? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when a Man that behaves himſelf otherwiſe,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53648:182"/>muſt be look'd upon as a Sot, and a Fool; one that knows nothing of the World, nor what becomes him to do in it: Thus to play this Farce dextrouſly, is the greateſt Mark of Wit; and the moſt affected <hi>Harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> in it, is the fineſt Gentleman; but not to be Vain is contemptible Stupidity, and he that declines playing the Fool, betrays his own want of Senſe and good Breeding. Nay, when there is no need of all this Form and Complaiſance, <hi>Vanity</hi> hangs about us ſtill: Witneſs the freer Diſcourſes of the moſt familiar Acquaintance, and intimate Friends. How many trifling Impertinences, Falſhoods, Banters, (I omit the wicked and miſchievous Part, becauſe that falls not under this Head) How many arrogant and vain Boaſtings go to the making up this ſort of Converſation too? Men are ſo induſtrious to take, to ſeek, to make occaſions of Talking of themſelves, or of ſomewhat that belongs to them; They do it with ſo ſenſible, and yet ſo nauſeous a Pleaſure; if they think they have ſaid or done a good thing, or that ſomewhat they are poſſeſt of is better than ordinary, They are ſo uneaſie till they have publiſh'd and enlarg'd upon it; as if all their Wit and Worth were loſt, unleſs other People were made ſenſible of it too: They catch at the very firſt Convenience, cry it up to the greateſt Degree imaginable; nay, they perfectly bring it in by Head and Shoulders, and interrupt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcourſe to ſtart This: And when any body elſe is Talking, we preſently thruſt our ſelves in, and take an Advantage of ſhewing our Parts; ſo eager are we that People ſhou'd underſtand what we are, and have a regard for us; and not for Us only, but for every thing that we have a regard for.</p>

Nay, many times an occaſional thing goes further with us than the principal Cauſe; and ſome paltry little Circumſtances make more ſenſible Impreſſions, and gall us more than the main Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to which they retain; as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Robe put <hi>Rome</hi> into greater Paſſion and Concern, than his Death it ſelf, and the Two and twenty Stabs in his Body had done before.</p>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53648:183"/>But as they are trifling and frivolous in themſelves, ſo they are ſuch as we may be very happy, and live very comfortably and conveniently without. Whereas on the other hand, thoſe that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and eſſential to our true Happineſs, find little or no part of the Regard due to them; and every Body is indifferent whether he hath Them or not. Thus the Condition of Man is all Air and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; His whole <hi>Happineſs</hi> imaginary; Opinion and Dream is all he purſues; and in this he ſtands Alone, and cannot match himſelf in the whole Word. <hi>God</hi> hath all <hi>Good</hi> in Eſſence and Reality, and <hi>Evil</hi> in Notion and Underſtanding only. <hi>Man,</hi> on the contrary, hath only fantaſtical <hi>Good,</hi> but his <hi>Evils</hi> are weighty and ſubſtantial. <hi>Beaſts</hi> are not ſatisfy'd with Opinion, nor do They feed upon Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but require ſomewhat that is preſent, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and real, to content them. <hi>Vanity</hi> is reſerv'd to Man for his Portion, the Inheritance and peculiar Right of his Nature.

For how ſhould ſo much Vanity be otherwiſe than Feeble and Frail? Accordingly, this Frailty is frankly confeſſed by all People, and ſeveral Inſtances of it reckoned up, which are too Plain not to be diſcerned: But then it is not obſerved in its due Proportion, nor in all Caſes where it really hath a Part; as in thoſe, for Inſtance, which ſeem to have more of <hi>Strength,</hi> and a leſs Mixture of <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> ſuch as Deſire; The Uſe and Enjoyment of what a Man is poſſeſt of; In his Good and his Evil; in ſhort, ſuch as Man takes a Pride in, and values himſelf upon. And yet, even Theſe ſuppoſed Glories and Excellencies of his Nature, are undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Weakneſs. This may poſſibly ſeem a Paradox at firſt Sight; but a few particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, will give us a clearer and more diſtinct View of the Thing.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for Deſires; It is manifeſt a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fix upon any Thing,<note place="margin">In deſiring and chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> not even in Wiſh and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſo as to ſit down with That, and reſt himſelf contented. We have it not in our Power, to Chuſe what is neceſſary, and ſit for us; nor to ſay, in Particular, what This would be. And if Providence in Wiſdom and Kindneſs, beſtow what we deſire, and what really is fit, upon us, yet it does not ſatisfie. We are Eternally gaping at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53648:184"/>what Future and Unknown; and find, that what is preſent never fills, never contents; but what we have not, is ever eſteemed above it. Could we ſuppoſe a Man ſo far indulged, that a Blank ſhould be put into his Hands, to write his own Terms; yet even That Fortune of his own Carving, would not be ſo to his Palate, but that in a ſhort Time he would retract it; ſome Alterations and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſomething to be added or taken away: In ſhort, he deſires he knows not what. How well ſoever the Particulars may pleaſe, yet when the Account comes to be ſummed up, nothing contents him; for, to ſay the Truth, he is Uneaſie, and diſcontented with his own ſelf.</p>

Firſt, in that he cannot manage, nor reap the Benefit of Things as they really are, and in their Native Purity; but there is a Neceſſity of diſguiſing, and adulterating them, that they may be accommodated to our Purpoſe. Elements, Metals, and other Things in their Primitive Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity are perfectly uſeleſs to us; Pleaſures and Delights, and never to be enjoyed without a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pain and Inconvenience.

As for Inſtance, The Chaſtity of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and that of a Widow; the Virtues of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and thoſe of a Married Life; Theſe Latter in each Kind, Widowhood and Marriage, being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of much more Encumbrance, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more Difficulty, and therefore more Virtue, than the quiet, and undiſturbed State of Celibacy and Virginity; though Thoſe on the other Hand, have the Advantage in Purity, and Grace, and Freedom from Buſineſs and Care. The Conſtancy and Greatneſs of Mind, which exerts it ſelf in Poverty and Want, in Affliction and Pain, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53648:185"/>Different from that, which preſerves a Man's Temper in Proſperity and Plenty; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Thankfulneſs of the Receiving Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, from the Liberality of the Giver. And as This holds in Virtues, ſo does it much more in Vices, ſeveral of which are not only very far Diſtant, but Diametrically oppoſite to each other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is no leſs obſervable, Secondly, That many Times our Matters are ſo ordered, as not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Performance of ſuch Actions, as relate to One Virtue, without encroaching upon ſome Other, and doing what is inconſiſtent with, or offenſive to That very Virtue we are practiſing; becauſe things often interfere and obſtruct us, ſo that we cannot ſatisfie One Duty, but at the Expence of Another. This is like what our Proverb calls <hi>Robbing Peter, to pay Paul,</hi> and yet thus it is; not from any Deficiency in Virtue it ſelf, but from the Impotence and Inſufficiency of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is too ſhort, too narrow, to give or receive any certain, conſtant, univerſal Rule of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtuouſly; and Man cannot ſo contrive his Methods, and provide himſelf with Helps, and Occaſions of doing Good, but that they will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently croſs and interrupt one another. Thus <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are ſometimes impracticable at once. If I engage againſt my Relation, or my Friend, in a Battle; <hi>Juſtice</hi> requires me to take his Life, and Treat him as an Adverſary; <hi>Charity</hi> and Affection bid me ſpare and preſerve him as a Friend. Suppoſe a Man mortally wounded, and that he hath nothing to expect, but the languiſhing out the miſerable Remains of Life, in extreme Torture; it were certainly an Act of Charity, to put this wretched Creature out of his Pain, by killing him out-right, as the Perſon who kill'd <hi>Saul</hi> alledged for himſelf; and yet this is ſuch a Mercy, as Juſtice would call one to an Account for; and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53648:186"/>
                        <hi>David</hi> puniſhed it accordingly. Nay, the being found near ſuch a Perſon in a lonely Place, when Search is made for the Murderer, though one be there with Intentions of Kindneſs, is exceeding Dangerous; and the leaſt, that can come of it, is the being made to undergo the Courſe of the Law; and brought upon Tryal for a Misfortune which one had no Hand in. And this laſt Inſtance ſhews, how <hi>Juſtice</hi> does not only offend againſt <hi>Charity,</hi> but alſo how it intangles and obſtructs it ſelf, according to that moſt true Obſervation,<note n="*" place="bottom">Summum Jus ſumma Injuria.</note>

Which is to make a way to Juſtice thro' Impudence, and Cozenage, and Falſhood. And what ſhall we ſay of that curſed Invention of Racks, which are a Tryal of Patience indeed, but none at all of Truth? For you ſhall never be able to get the Truth out of Them that can, nor out of Them that cannot endure them. Why ſhou'd we think extremity of Pain can more diſpoſe a Man to tell what is, than to tell what is not? If an Innocent Man be ſuppoſed endu'd with Patience enough to bear the Torture, why ſhould the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for ſaving his Life inſpire a guilty Perſon with the ſame degree of Reſolution? I know it is commonly reply'd in excuſe of this Barbarity, That the Pain aſtoniſhes and enfeebles the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and extorts a Confeſſion of his Treachery from him; whereas it hath the quite contrary effects of confirming and fortifying the Innocent. But the Contrary of this happens ſo often, that to ſpeak the Truth, This is an enſnaring and a pitiful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; a poor and baſe way of Dealing, full of Doubt and Uncertainty.

You'll ſay, By bearing the Rack he is abſolv'd; I thank you very kindly. But This, however, tho' an Evil, is the leaſt, Humane Infirmity could contrive; and yet this is not practiſed every where neither.

And what Perverſneſs is this? that what we love and ſeek ſo paſſionately, we ſhould be ſo loath, ſo angry to find? Truth is not only amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but knowable too, yet not perfectly ſo by Us; for at preſent it ſeems Man is only ſtrong in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but weak in his Enjoyment of it; and not able to receive what he deſires.

Nothing in Nature is ſo Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal as Diſparity; nothing ſo rare, ſo difficult, ſo impoſſible indeed as Likeneſs: And nothing argues greater Weakneſs, and want of Judgment, than the not being able to diſcern and diſtinguiſh the Difference. This, however, is to be underſtood of ſuch a Likeneſs, and ſuch a Diverſity as is perfect, and holds in every Circumſtance: For indeed both Similitude and Diſſimilitude are everywhere in ſome reſpect and degree. No Two things are in every
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53648:188"/>regard Like; none in all reſpects Unlike one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So exceedingly ingenious hath Nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd herſelf in the Mixture and Compoſition of the World.</p>
                     <p>But after all, What can make more full Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Humane Infirmity, than <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf hath done? Its main Intention and End is to lower Man in his own Eſteem; to ſhew, and make him duly ſenſible, how <hi>wicked,</hi> how <hi>weak,</hi> how <hi>mere a Nothing</hi> he is; and in this humble Senſe, to drive him to God for Succour and Support, who is, indeed, his <hi>Happineſs,</hi> his <hi>Reſuge</hi> and <hi>Strength;</hi> nay, his <hi>All.</hi> The firſt Method taken to inculcate theſe mean Notions of our Selves, is by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, Reminding, Upbraiding us; ſetting before us the Reproachful Titles of <hi>Duſt and Aſhes, Earth, Fleſh and Blood, Graſs,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>After that, it inſinuates this Truth after a moſt noble, and excellent, and ſtupendous manner; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing God, humbling, debaſing himſelf, and becoming weak for the ſake of Man; ſpeaking, expoſtulating, entreating, promiſing, ſwearing, growing angry, threatning; and, in a Word, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Treaty and Terms, and managing him by all the endearing Arts of Perſuaſion, in the ſame tender, kind, condeſcending Methods, with which a fond Father wins and gains upon his Children, by ſtooping to their little Follies, and imitating their Infant-Imperfections. So very great it ſeems, ſo inſuperable was the Weakneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that no Acceſs could be attain'd, no Correſpondence held with the Divinity, till God himſelf was pleas'd to make the firſt Approaches; and by deſcending to our Capacities, and our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, to draw us nearer to himſelf. While He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in his Native Majeſty, the Diſtance was too vaſt; and therefore the only way to bring Us up to Heaven, was for God to come down upon Earth.</p>

                     <p> A Third Inſtance is in the <hi>Ordinary Exerciſe of Religion;</hi> for what more lively Emblems, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive Symbols, more unanſwerable Proofs of our Impotence and Inſirmity, than the <hi>Principal</hi> and moſt <hi>Solemn Acts</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> have ever been?</p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay to <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages ſeem to have been in uſe all the World over? I mention not the horrible unnatural Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, into which, thro' the Corruption of Mankind, and the Wicked Artifice of the Devil, this Cuſtom degenerated in Idolatrous Countries; thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Oblations, or rather Murders and Maſſacres of Men and Children, of the beſt and moſt innocent Perſons among them: But, confining our ſelves to that of Beaſts only, we ſhall be clearly convinc'd, that Theſe were ſo many Marks and Remembrancers of Men's own Vileneſs and Infirmity.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt of all; In the very Nature of the Thing, they were ſo many <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Curſe and Condemnation we lay under;</hi> a ſort of publick, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Acknowledgment, that the Offerer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had juſtly deſerv'd that Death, inflicted by Him upon the Beaſt; and a beſeeching God to accept that <hi>devoted Life,</hi> in the ſtead of his <hi>own forfeited Life:</hi> For without all Diſpute, had there been no <hi>Curſe,</hi> no Condemnation to which Men were liable; neither wou'd there have been any Place, or poſſible Occaſion for <hi>Bloody Offerings,</hi> Expiations, or Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p>This is a farther Evidence, Secondly, of our Weakneſs, if we look at the Meanneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, upon which that Uſage grew and was encourag'd; and That cou'd be no other than the Hope of Appeaſing and Gratifying Almighty God, by ſuch Bloody Oblations. I ſpeak not now of the Reaſons why God inſtituted Sacrifices; but of that Notion which plainly appears to have been predominant in the Minds of Men, who did not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53648:189"/>ſee into the Myſterious End of them; which the Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves never did; and much leſs cou'd it be expected that the <hi>Pagan</hi> World ſhou'd penetrate into it.</p>
                     <p>It is true, indeed, Almighty God, in great Grace and Compaſſion to thoſe more early and ignorant Ages of the World, which knew no better; did very favourably accept Good Men, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with this ſort of Devotion; and the Apoſtle takes particular Notice of his having <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Abel and his Offering;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. xi.</note> as the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament does, of his teſtifying that Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by viſible Signs, in the Caſe of <hi>Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and Others. There being this Motive to his Mercy, that what was done of that kind proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from an Intention to ſerve and honour him; and that the Underſtandings of Men were groſs and heavy; they were in their Minority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People) but at the ſame time honeſt and well-meaning: And it is not improbable, that this Opinion, ſo univerſal at That time, might repreſent Sacrifices to them, as a Dictate of the Law of Nature, and the only proper Method of Divine Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>There was, it is confeſſed, another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which rendred <hi>Sacrifices</hi> very valuable and well-pleaſing to God; whereby they were made uſe of, as <hi>Figures</hi> and Repreſentations of that One truly meritorious <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to be offer'd upon the Altar of the Croſs afterwards. But this is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. And as it is a Common, ſo is it an Excellent and Adorable Inſtance of the Divine Wiſdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert what is of Human Inſtitution, Natural Uſage, or of a Corporeal Nature, to High and Holy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and make ſuch things as the Ceremonial Law conſiſted of, turn to a Spiritual Account.</p>

And hence it was, that <hi>Julian,</hi> the Emperour, its moſt profeſſed, moſt inveterate Enemy, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to it, offered more <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> than perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Man ever did; and endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce This Way of Worſhip, and Idolatry again, as being both directly in Contradiction to the Chriſtian Religion. But of This we have ſpoken ſufficiently; and therefore let us now take a ſhort View of ſome of the other conſiderable Branches of Religion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bleſſed Sacraments,</hi> when Adminiſhed to us in Elements ſo common, and of ſuch mean Eſteem, as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> and not only ſo, but in the very Act of Adminiſtration bearing. Reſemblance to the moſt Vulgar and Deſpicable Actions of Life, as <hi>Wiſhing, Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> are plain <hi>Memento's</hi> of our continual Weakneſſes, and Wants, our Miſeries and Pollutions. And as the marvellous Efficacy magnifies the Almighty Power and Goodneſs of God, ſo the Need we have of them, ſhould humble us, with mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflections upon our own feeble Condition.</p>
                     <p>Thus again, <hi>Repentance</hi> is preſcribed, as the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the only Remedy for our Spiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and 'tis plain, This, Conſidered in it ſelf, is an Act full of Shame and Reproach; it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us with our Faults and Follies; afflicts our Souls with Grief and ſad Remorſe; and ſhews us to our Selves in the Worſt, and moſt Deformed Figures, that can be: But, however Evil and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely this may ſeem in it ſelf, yet it is Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for reconciling us to God, and That is enough to reconcile Us to it. Another Inſtance may be
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53648:192"/>taken from <hi>Oaths,</hi> which are, indeed, Religious Acts, when lawfully practiſed, by Reaſon of the Name of God, ſolemnly invoked in them: But yet, it is evident, that the Common Uſe and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, is a Scurvy Symptome, a moſt ſhameful Argument, how little Mankind are to be truſted; What Monſters of Falſhood, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, of Errour and Ignorance, we are! How vilely ſuſpicious and diſtruſtful the Perſon requiring them is, and how liable to Jealouſie, the Perſon from whom they are demanded; and what a mean Opinion thoſe Law-givers, who ordered them, had, of Mens <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> when one's bare Word will not give Satisfaction, nd (as our Saviour ſays) <hi>whatſoever is more than this,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. V. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>cometb of Evil.</hi> Thus you ſee, not only how Weak and Sickly our Condition is; but likewiſe what ſort of Remedies, <hi>Religion</hi> hath found it Neceſſary to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for our Cure. Since it may be ſaid, in ſome Senſe, with Regard to theſe Matters, <hi>That God hath choſen the weak things of this World.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. I.</note> He did not appoint ſuch as were Nobleſt and moſt Excellent in their own Nature, but condeſcended to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Circumſtances of the Patients, and hath accommodated his Applications to Our Capacities. So that the Goodneſs theſe Things have, is not ſo much inherent in their own Nature, as it is Relative, and derived from the Uſes they ſerve, and the Ends to which they are directed. They are Good, as Medicines are, becauſe they check Evil, and prevent that which is Worſe. They kill the Cauſe and Occaſion of themſelves; for, they ſprung from Sin, and their Buſineſs is to extirpate, and reſtrain Sin. They are Good, as publick Executions are in Common-Wealths; as Sneezing, and Vomiting, and other ſuch violent Exacuations, in our Bodies, whereby the noxious Humours, which oppreſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are diſcharged; ſuch as are at once the Sign
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53648:192"/>and the Remedy of a Diſtemper. In ſhort, It is well for us that we have them; but it had been abundantly better for us, if we had never had any Occaſion to make uſe of them; and That Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we never ſhould have had, if Man had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as God made him, and preſerved his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Wiſdom and Integrity. And accordingly we may take Notice, that Theſe are Things fitted to this frail and mortal State only; and not any of Thoſe more Noble Parts of Religion, which ſhall be the Eternal Exerciſe of our Souls hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we are releaſed from this Bondage of Fleſh and Corruption. When our Imperfections and our Sins ceaſe, Theſe ceaſe with them; whereas our Praiſes, our Love of God, and other Duties of Intrinſick Goodneſs, and of Eternal Uſe and Obligation; ſo far from dying with our Sins and Bodies, that they will be the more Conſtant, the more Delightful Employment, of our Sinleſs and Exalted State; and make a conſiderable Part of the Heavenly, and Divine Life.</p>
                     <p>The former Remarks have ſhewn Man's Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity in <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> what follows may perhaps ſurpriſe you more, becauſe it undertakes to repreſent him no leſs impotent in <hi>Evil</hi> too. For They who do their utmoſt Endeavour to be Wicked, cannot be entirely ſo, but are always forced to leave ſomewhat unfiniſhed. There is conſtantly ſome Secret Remorſe, ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Honour, or Fear, that checks, and pulls them back; ſlackens and enervates the Will, and keeps them from part of the Villany they intended. And this Reſtraint hath been the Ruine of many a One, who hath propoſed to ſave himſelf, by venturing no farther. Which ſort of Folly, and the Miſcarriages that have been owing to it, gave Occaſion to that Proverb, <hi>That a Man muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver play the Fool by halves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:53648:193"/>
                     <p> This <hi>Rule</hi> is Judicious enough, but deſerves a little Illuſtration, becauſe, as it hath a <hi>Good,</hi> ſo is it likewiſe capable of a very <hi>Bad</hi> Senſe. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, as if a Man ought to abandon all Conſcience, and might in any Circumſtances do Well and Wiſely to be Wicked without Reſerve, is a very perverſe Interpretation, and would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a moſt pernicious Maxim. In this Reſpect, that Contrary Proverb is moſt True, that <hi>The ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Follies are the Beſt.</hi> But it is True too, that in ſome Caſes Mildneſs and Moderation are of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence; as particularly, when we have a deſperate and formidable Enemy to deal with, and (as we commonly ſay) <hi>Hold a Wolf by the Ears.</hi> A Man then hath no ſafe Middle-Way left; no Courſe to take, but either the winning him over entirely by Courteſie, or abſolutely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, and put him out of a Capacity, to do us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſchief. This was the conſtant Method of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and a very prudent One no doubt it is. Thus <hi>Camillus</hi> remonſtrated to the Senate in the Caſe of the <hi>Latines,</hi> after ſeveral Revolts, ſuing for Terms of Reconciliation; That they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be admitted into Friendſhip, or not ſuffered to be a People any longer; and<note n="*" place="bottom">Dii immortales ita vos potentes hujus conſilii fecerunt, ut ſit Latium deinde, aut non ſit, in veſtrâ manu poſuerint.

That of <hi>Courteſie,</hi> is the Nobler Conqueſt, and ought to be a Man's Firſt Choice; The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is only for Caſes of Extremity, and ſuch Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as Kindneſs will do no Good upon. Now, from all theſe Inſtances, the Infirmity of Humane Nature appears very evidently, both with Regard to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> A Man can neither perform, nor avoid either entirely, and without reſerve; and what he does, or ſo much as he declines of it, is neither the One nor the Other, abſolutely and without mixture. There is ſome Allay, ſome Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both Extremes, and thus Man hath it not in his Power to be <hi>exquiſitely Good,</hi> or <hi>exquiſitely Wicked,</hi> but finds himſelf checked and confined, on either Hand.</p>

And this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remark is likewiſe True, That Men, as they have, or want Courage, for One of Theſe, ſo do they conſtantly, for the Other of them too. Now, This is a very Fooliſh Niceneſs, to deprive our Selves, or our Friend, of ſo Beneficial and Neceſſary a Kindneſs, merely for a ſlight Scratch, which at the moſt does but pinch our Ears, and make them tingle a little. And near of Kin to This, is that other Folly, of not daring to deny what we are ſenſible is not fit for us to grant, and not being able to receive a Repulſe, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of Temper.</p>

This indeed hath been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome great and generous Spirits; of <hi>scipio</hi> eſpecially, who ſeveral times weathered his Point thus, with marvellous Conſtancy and Firmneſs of Soul.

That the depending too much upon one's Own Innocence, and not ſubmitting to remove Jealouſies, is ill Treatment: Or elſe, this obſtinate Silence and Contempt, they interpret Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, Diſtruſt of Juſtice, and want of Ability to juſtifie one's ſelf effectually.

Some Perſons are vanquiſh'd into Mercy by Tears, and Submiſſions, and earneſt Entreaties; and are offended at Firmneſs and Courage, as if this were Sullenneſs, and Obſtinacy, and Pride. Others Acknowledgments, and Prayers, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints make no manner of Impreſſion upon; but Conſtancy and Reſolution wins them. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe proceeds no doubt from <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> and accordingly, we find it more incident and common to Mean, and Effeminate, and Vulgar Souls. But the Second it is not ſo eaſie to give an account of; and yet this Temper is incident to
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53648:196"/>Men of all Conditions. One would think it an Argument of a brave and generous Spirit, to be wrought upon by Virtue, and a generous Manly Behaviour; and ſo no doubt it is, if This be done out of a due Veneration for Virtue, as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> receiv'd a Soldier into Favour, for the gallant and obſtinate Defence he made againſt him; and as <hi>Pompey,</hi> the whole City of the <hi>Mammertines,</hi> out of the regard he had to <hi>Zeno,</hi> who was one of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And as the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> forgave the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the reſt of them that were beſieged with him, for the Bravery of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who convey'd them away upon their Heads. But if this Yielding proceed from the Surprize and Confuſion, occaſion'd by the over-bearing Power of ſome Superiour Virtue, (as the People of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who were quite diſpirited when they heard <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in his Defence, reckon up his good Services, and noble Exploits, and Reproach their baſe Ingratitude with a becoming Indignation; and <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he deſpiſed the noble Reſolution of <hi>Betis,</hi> who was taken with the City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> of which he was Commander) then there is another Account to be given of it.

                        <p>THis Author had ſaid in the Preface to his Book, that his Deſign was to write after the manner of the Academick Philoſophers; who made it their Buſineſs, o repreſent each ſide of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in its utmoſt beauty and Strength, without delivering any deciſive Opinion in the Caſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to ſtand by either branch of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53648:196"/>An Attentive Reader will eaſily obſerve, that Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> hath thus far maintain'd the Character he propos'd for his Pattern, as to make the moſt of the Arguments that offer'd for his preſent purpoſe, without precluding himſelf from putting quite another Face upon the Matter, when his Subject requir'd, that it ſhould be taken by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Handle. Thus you will find him varying concerning the Attaining of Knowledge by Senſe, and whether This be the Only poſſible way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; by comparing Chapter X. and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter XIII.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.11,</note> And in the very Subject of this Chapter and Section; how diſtant is the Reflection he makes here, from thoſe others which He and other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers propoſe to us elſewhere; upon the Noble Excellence of Virtue, the Largeneſs of its Scope and Extent; its Independence upon Fortune and Caſualties; and the mighty Convenience of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething commendable and proper for our Exerciſe, and ſo making us Happy in every poſſible Condition of Humane Life?</p>
                        <p>This Variety then of Thought is a good warning to avoid what our Author ſo frequently condemns; Too eaſie a Credulity, and taking his Notions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truſt: For we find even thoſe Notions not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, but accommodated to his preſent Subject and Deſign: And That Deſign well atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and taken along with us, will be a very good Guide to our Underſtanding him aright. For Inſtance; He had laid it down in the beginning of this Treatiſe, as a Fundamental Principle, That the Ignorance of a Man's Self is the great and moſt governing Errour of his Life; of an Influence ſo univerſally pernicious, that all his Vices and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes are owing to it. But then This was ſuch an Ignorance as diſpoſed Men to over-value and neglect themſelves, by covering, and quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking the Defects and Diſadvantages of Humane
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53648:197"/>Nature; and ſo kept the Patient incurable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inſenſible of his Diſeaſe. In order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Evil it is, that Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to ſhew Men to Themſelves; and 'tis evident his Deſign requires that he ſhould ſhew the worſt of them; and paint only Thoſe Features and Lines ſtrong, which may diſcover their Deformity, and tend to humble and to mortifie them firſt; and then to awaken that Care, which can never be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly employ'd, till they are firſt con'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>A Philoſopher now under theſe Circumſtances, is thus far like a Law-giver, that it will be Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him to ſuppoſe, and provide againſt the Worſt; and therefore, as I wou'd not extenuate the Art or Wiſdom of my Author, nor do Injury to his Argument; ſo neither can I be juſt to the Dignity of our Nature, and grateful to the Wiſe and Good Creator of it, unleſs I give my Reader theſe ſhort, and (as I conceive) neceſſary Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in peruſing this <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of the Book.

                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> That What is here truly ſaid of ſome, or moſt Men, (and was ſit to be ſaid in general Terms, becauſe the worſt Men have moſt need of ſuch Treatiſes, and ſo are moſt concern'd in them) muſt not be ſo univerſally apply'd, or underſtood, as to be taken for a common Standard, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Repreſentation of all Mankind without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</item>

                                 <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That what we Charge as a Defect be really ſo, and owing to the Cauſe we aſcribe it
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53648:197"/>to. Theſe are neceſſary Cautions for the ſake of doing common Juſtice, as well as preventing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in our Selves. It were unreaſonable to take our Meaſures of all Mankind in reſpect of their Bodies, from the Sick or Lame; and from the Fools or the Sots, every whit as extravagant for their Souls. It were a charging God fooliſhly, to aſcribe thoſe Impotencies and Evils to Him, which have been the Conſequences of our Diſobedience againſt Him. And it is a moſt unthankful Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Beauty and Wiſdom of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to charge That upon a Defect in Nature, Which is really no other than a natural Reſult of the different Fortunes and Conditions of Men: Which is exactly the Caſe here before us: For wherein is the Excellent Wiſdom of that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more clearly ſeen, than in that uſeful Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Circumſtances, which Men are placed in? And what can more Vindicate the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God from any reaſonable Exception, than This, That there are particular Virtues appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to every ſort of Perſons and Accidents; and that no Circumſtance of Life is poſſible, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable, but it may be adorned and recommended by Virtues, which are ſeaſonable and diſtinguiſhing for that very Condition? This Variety of Virtues then is far from a Natural Weakneſs; it is not owing to Nature, but to Fortune and Providence; and is ſo far from a Diſparagement, that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Ornament and Advantage to the World. Indeed if Nature have any thing to do in it, it is the Nature of Virtue it ſelf; for even Almighty God, who is Goodneſs in Perfection, yet does not exerciſe both Juſtice and Mercy (for Inſtance) at once, to the ſame Perſon, and in the ſame reſpects: And how is Man the worſe for not doing things inconſiſtent and incompatible, and what even Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf does not do? The ſame
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53648:198"/>may be ſaid of the Defects of Juſtice, taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of afterwards; at leaſt in ſome degree: Thoſe being the unavoidable Conſequences of Multitudes incorporated into Civil Societies, and ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts nicely interwoven with one another: All which I thought it my Duty to hint at, thereby to prevent any mean, repining, or ungrateful Thoughts, which ſuch Reflections as Theſe, when laviſhly ſpoken, or unwarily received, might be apt to raiſe in Men's Minds, to the Diſquiet of their own Hearts, and the Diſhonour of the Maker and Governour, not only of the Humane, but of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Nature.</item>

                     <p>MAN is a Creature wonderfully Various and Mutable; and the great Difficulty of coming to any Judgment concerning Him, which ſhould be certain, fixt, and univerſal, proceeds from hence, That our Lives are not all of a Piece, but made up of diſagreeing and different Parcels. Moſt part of our Actions do not ariſe from ſteady Thought, but are ſudden Starts and Sallies, the Effects of Accident and Impulſe, and look like Shreds of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stuffs patch'd up, and ſewed together. Firſt Irreſolution, and then Fickleneſs and Change of Meaſures when we have reſolved, are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt and moſt apparent Vices of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And our Actions, 'tis plain, do ſo ſtrangely croſs and contradict one another, that it is not eaſie to believe ſo many Contrarieties ſhould all be deriv'd from the ſame Original. We change
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53648:198"/>and are not ſenſible of it: We run eagerly after every Whimſie of our own Appetites, and are born away by the Stream of Accidents and Paſſions; Tis no more Reaſon, but Inclination that governs us:<note n="*" place="bottom">At nil potet eſſe aequabile, quod non à certâ ratione profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcitur.</note>

To be Miſerable is the Property of our Nature; Man alone is ſo, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is ſo, as will appear by and by. For a true Repreſentation of this Matter, it were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to run over all the parts of his Life; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his Eſſence, his Coming into the World, his Stay in it, and his Departure out of it. This were an endleſs Undertaking, and I pretend not to it; nor need I indeed, becauſe ſo many have handled the Subject before me. When I intend at preſent, is only to inſtance in ſome Particulars, not commonly taken Notice of, nor reputed Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes; at leaſt, ſuch as Men do not throughly conſider, nor are ſufficiently ſenſible of, tho' they be in reality very grievous, if we make a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Take this then for the Firſt Proof of Man's Miſery, <note place="margin">In his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and End.</note> That his Firſt Appearances in the World are Mean and Deſpicable; but his Going out of it, his Death and Deſtruction, are eſteem'd Glorious and full of Honour.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53648:200"/>to think this a monſtrous Creature, in the Production whereof there is ſo much Shame, and ſo much Reputation in the Unmaking him again. What relates to the former of Theſe, Modeſty draws a Veil over; But the latter is proclaimed and receiv'd with Triumph; The Inſtruments are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with great Expence; We wear them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly about us, and look upon Them as Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our Perſons. We are born in Chambers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but die before many Spectators, in Fields and Camps, in the Sight of the Sun, and with Sound of Trumpet, and are proud of Butchering one another. Nature hath provided but One Way of coming into the World, but a great many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out; and, as if even thus Nature had done too little, Invention and Induſtry have added their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and make Men every Day more Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in new Arts of Killing. Laws and Cuſtoms have not aſſigned any Recompence for Mens Skill in multiplying, or in preſerving Mankind; But all our Enſigns of Honour, and for the deſtroying it. Arms of Families, Advancements, Riches Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Triumphs, and Trophies are decreed to Them that are mighty to oppreſs, to grieve, to murder Mankind. The Two great Heroes of all Story, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were each of them (according to <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Computation) the Death of more than a million of Men, and yet neither of theſe added One to the Number.

The Firſt is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part about a Man is ſuſceptible of Pain, and but very few capable of Pleaſure. The Second,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53648:201"/>That Thoſe which are capable of Pleaſure, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but one or two ſorts of it; but all the Parts receive great variety of Pains, and Thoſe of the moſt different kinds too; Extremity of Heat and Cold, Pricking, Burſting, Bruiſing, Scratching, Flaying, Beating, Scalding, Fainting, Swooning, Extenſion, Oppreſſion, Relaxation of the Parts; and others without Number, that want a Name, beſides Thoſe of the Soul; ſo that a Man is much more able to ſuffer, than to expreſs his Sufferings. To this muſt be added, that a Man cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in Pleaſures: All his Delights are a ſhort Blaze; ſhould they laſt long, they would deſtroy Themſelves, and become painful and inſupportable. But his Pains are of a great length, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to certain Seaſons, as Pleaſures are. Thus Pain hath a more abſolute Dominion over us; its Territories are larger; its Reign more laſting, more general, more uncontroll'd, and, in a Word, more Natural, than that of Pleaſure is, or can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Three Remarks may be added as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; as Firſt, Pain and Sorrow is much more common, and comes oftner upon us; Pleaſure is hard to be met with, and ſeldom Returns. Then, Pain comes of its own accord, without any ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Endeavour of ours to procure it; but Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure never approaches voluntarily; we are fain to court it, to buy it dear, and oftentimes pay more for it than it is worth. Pleaſure is never Entire, but hath always ſome Abatement, ſome Alloy of Uneaſineſs, ſomewhat attending it that we cannot like, and had much rather were otherwiſe; but Pain and Diſſatisfaction are often without any manner of Mixture or Mitigation. And after all this, the worſt part of the Bargain, and that which moſt clearly proves our Miſery, is, That Extremity of Pleaſure does not affect us ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53648:202"/>as a very ſmall Degree of Pain or Sickneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Segnius homines bona quàm mala ſentiunt.</note>

With what Eagerneſs and Pleaſure does he thruſt himſelf into Buſineſs; and how inquiſitive and impatient is he to diſcover That, which, if it would preſent it ſelf to his View without any Trouble of his,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53648:203"/>he ought rather to turn away, and hide his Eyes from? And this buſie Temper is owing either to a Natural Reſtleſneſs, diſpoſing us to be miſerable; or from a vain Affectation to be Judicious, and Wiſe, and always employ'd; that is, in plain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> to make our ſelves Fools and Wretches: As we needs muſt be, when our Induſtry to perplex our ſelves is ſo great, that when we have no Buſineſs of our own to diſquiet us, we go abroad in queſt of Troubles, and officiouſly concern our ſelves with the Affairs of other People. In a Word, Man is under exceeding great and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agitation of Mind, not only from ſuch Thoughts and Cares as are unneceſſary, and turn to no account; but ſuch as are thorny, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and injurious to him: The <hi>Preſent</hi> gives him Pain; the <hi>Paſt,</hi> Regret; the <hi>Future,</hi> Perplexity; and, by his Behaviour under all this, one would think him afraid of nothing ſo much, as the not being ſufficiently Miſerable, after all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to render himſelf ſo.

Nothing is ſo frequent, ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, as Complaints; and where Occaſions are but light and trivial, he cheriſhes and heightens the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; calls himſelf the moſt unhappy Man in the World, and takes it ill not to be thought ſo;<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſt quaedam dolendi voluptas.</note>

He hath too much of it in deſpight of all Endeavours to the contrary; and yet his great Fear is, that he ſhould not have Miſery enough. He is always in Chaſe of ſome freſh Unhappineſs, and in pain till he hath overtaken it. But now we will take him in another Proſpect, affected with a Senſe, and weary of ſome particular Evil; (for even This does not happen always; and many Miſeries are endured without any uneaſie Reſentments at all) And when his Mind is thus far awakened, let us next obſerve, how he endeavours to diſengage himſelf, and what Remedies are to be apply'd in order to a Cure. And Theſe are ſuch in truth, as rather fret and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Sore, than heal it; for by quitting one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he only exchanges it for another, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a worſe. But ſtill the very Change is pleaſing, or at leaſt, it ſooths and allays the Pain a little. He fancies one Evil may be cured by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and this Imagination is owing to a vulgar Errour, that ſeems to have bewitch'd Mankind; which makes them always ſuſpect things that are eaſie and cheap; and eſteem nothing truly valuable and advantageous, but what coſts us dear, and is attended with much Labour and Diſſiculty. And This again riſes higher, (for it is not more ſtrange
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53648:204"/>than true, and nothing can more fully prove, that Man is exceeding miſerable) That, let the Evils we lie under, be what they will, ſome other Evil is neceſſary, for the expelling and ſubduing them; and whether the Body or the Mind be the part affected, the Caſe in this reſpect is much the ſame. For the Diſeaſes both of the one and the other, are never to be healed and taken off, but by Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Pain, and great Trouble: Thoſe of the <hi>Mind</hi> by Penance, Watchings, and Faſtings; hard Uſage, and courſe Fare; Confinements and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; which, notwithſtanding the Voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Devotion of them, muſt of neceſſity be afflicting and pungent; becauſe the whole effect of them would be loſt, if we could ſuppoſe them in any degree ſubſervient to Eaſe and Pleaſure. Thoſe of the <hi>Body</hi> require nauſeous Medicines, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, Cauſticks, and ſevere Dietings; as They whoſe Unhappineſs it is to be oblig'd to a Courſe of Phyſick, know by woful Experience. They are got between the Millſtones, (as they ſay) ground and bruiſed on one ſide by the Diſeaſe, and on the other by a Regimen as bad as the Diſeaſe. Thus Ignorance is cured by long laborious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Poverty by Sweat and Toil; and Care and Trouble are as Natural in all the Proviſions for Body and Mind both, as it is for Birds to fly.</p>

Tis to take away from him all power of Feeling, or being hurt by the Revenge we intend; and that very Act, which deſigns him the greateſt Miſchief, ſets him at perfect Eaſe.

Tis pretty odd, I confeſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer things purely imaginary, before Thoſe that are real and ſubſtantial; and yet this is the Caſe of that unreaſonable Valuation we put upon things that are abſent, and at a diſtance, and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; upon things Before we have them, and After we have loſt them. The Reaſon of ſo unequal a Proceeding in theſe two Caſes laſt mention'd, ſeems to be This; That the Value we ſet upon things Before we have them, is not proportion'd to their real intrinſick Worth, but to the falſe Idea's our own Imaginations form, or the vain Boaſts other People make of them; Both which are always big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more beautiful than the Life: But Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Experience diſcover the Truth, and then we learn to rate them after the Excellence they actually have, and the Benefit that can be made out of them. Again; The things we have loſt are lookt upon with Melancholy, and much Regret, becauſe then we conſider them entire, and in the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53648:207"/>Groſs, whereas the Uſe and Enjoyment we had of them was not ſo, but by Piece-meals, and by little at a time. In which Men are commonly much more unkind to Themſelves, than they need to be: For they defer their own Happineſs, reſerve it for a farther Day, and always promiſe themſelves Time and Opportunities enough for enjoying it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that even what they have, they are ſo ſtingy in the uſe of, that they are ſcarce ſenſible of what they poſſeſs; and it is in a manner all one as if they had it not. And This ſeems to be the true account, why the Paſſion and Concern for our Loſſes and our Wants, is more vehement and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than the Pleaſures and Satisfactions taken in what we poſſeſs. And in this no doubt we muſt allow a great Mixture of <hi>Weakneſs</hi> as well as <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> We are not ſufficient for full and perfect En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and only capable of Deſiring intenſely and in perfection. There is indeed a vicious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Mind, directly oppoſite to That I have been ſpeaking of; which is, That Degree of Self-ſufficiency and Satisfaction, that whatever We are, or have, appears to us incomparably better than all the World beſides. We can be pleas'd, nay, we can be in common Charity with nothing but our Own; and whatever is ſo, nothing can be ſuperior, nothing equal, nothing like or comparable to it. I dare not ſay this Quality argues Men any Wiſer than the other; but all the World, I believe, will admit, that it makes them Eaſier, and contributes much more to their Happineſs and Content.</p>

The ſhewing one's ſelf forward and zealous upon all occaſions, to reſent things warmly, and engage in Diſputes with Peremptorineſs and Paſſion, as often as there is any fair and plauſible Pretence given, of appearing to be a Man affectionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for Juſtice, or Religion; for promoting the Publick Good, or gaining the Love of the People.

The bearing a very great regard to thoſe Actions, which require a great deal of buſtle and ſtir in the doing, and make a Noiſe in the World; and to ſlight and undervalue all that are done in a ſtill, ſedate, and obſcure manner: As if no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects could ever follow upon ſuch a dull, heavy way of proceeding; but all Men were aſleep, and did nothing, that do it not with Hurry and Clutter. In ſhort; All thoſe vain Preferences, which Men give to Art above Nature, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of this kind; for One of Theſe, works with Labour and Obſervation; the Other eaſily, quiet, and unſeen. And thus whatever is ſwell'd, and blown up by Induſtry and Invention; that which cracks about our Ears, and ſtrikes ſtrongly upon our Senſes, (and all this is Artificial) we reſpect and value highly; infinitely above That which is mild, and gentle, and ſimple, and uniform, and common; for ſuch are the Products of Nature. The former of Theſe awakens us into Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the latter advances ſilently, and leaves, or lays us aſleep.</p>

The putting unfair and perverſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations upon the good Actions of Others; and when the Thing is well in it ſelf, attributing it to baſe, or trifling, or wicked Cauſes or Occaſions. So did They, whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> is angry with, for pretending, that the Death of <hi>Cato</hi> the Younger proceeded from no other Principle, than his Fear of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> And ſome Others yet more ſenſeleſly, charg'd it upon Ambition. This is a moſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Symptom of a ſick Judgment; a Diſeaſe that proceeds, either from Wickedneſs at home, and a general Corruption of the Will and Manners, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing Men to pervert every Thing to the worſt Senſe; or elſe from Uneaſineſs and Envy againſt Perſons that are better than Themſelves; or elſe from a Miſ-giving Quality within, which redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all their Belief to the Compaſs and Size of their own Abilities; ſo meaſuring others by their own Standard; believing Every one as bad as they know Themſelves to be; and abſolutely incapable of doing things better, or propoſing nobler Ends in their Actions, than their own uſually are. Or perhaps, as probable an Account of this as any of the former, may be a Natural Weakneſs and Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of Soul, which, like tender Eyes, cannot bear to look at ſo ſtrong and clear a Light, as that which Virtue ſheds, when Pure, and in its native Beauties. Nor is it amiſs here to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Practice exceeding common; which is, Men's affecting to ſhew the <hi>Nicety</hi> of their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Smartneſs</hi> of their <hi>Wit,</hi> in finding Faults, ſuppreſſing, extenuating, diſguiſing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſetting Things in their worſt Light, and eclipſing the Glory of the braveſt Actions. In all which, one would wonder they ſhould ſuppoſe any thing worth valuing themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince it is manifeſt, all Dexterity of this kind is a much greater Demonſtration of their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53648:209"/>Ill-Nature, than it can be of their Parts; and as it is the Vileſt and moſt Diſingenuous, ſo is it the Eaſieſt and moſt Vulgar way of Wit, in the World.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Another, which ſeems to be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Teſtimony of the <hi>Miſery of Humane Minds,</hi> (tho' ſomewhat more nice, and out of the way of common Obſervation) is, That the Soul in its calm, and ſound, and compoſed Eſtate, can riſe no higher than the perception of thoſe Objects, and the performance of ſuch Operations, as are Common, and Natural, and of a moderate Size: But in order to the raiſing it up to ſuch as are Divine and Supernatural, ſuch as admit Men into the Secrets of Heaven, it is diſtemper'd, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agitated; either by vehement Impulſes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, and Enthuſiaſms; or by Trances and deep Sleeps. This I gather, not only from the <hi>Tripods</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Heathen <hi>Pythia,</hi> but from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Accounts given us of Revelations, and the extraordinary Manifeſtations God was pleaſed to make of Himſelf to Prophets, and Holy Men in Scripture: Such as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and others in the Old Teſtament; and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the New. All which Inſtances ſeem to argue, that the only Natural ways of attaining to theſe extraordinary Communications, are by Tranſport and Sleep, by <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Dreams.</hi> So that our Mind, it ſeems, is never ſo Wiſe, as when it is out of its Senſes; nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo truly Awake, as in Sleep. It arrives beſt at its Journey's End, by leaving the Common Road; and takes the Nobleſt and moſt ſucceſsful Flights, when its own Faculties appear moſt depreſſed; as if it were neceſſary to Loſe it ſelf for the Finding ſomewhat better and more lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to be Miſerable in order to its being
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53648:209"/>Happy. <q>This ſeems moſt Natural,<note place="margin">Advert.</note> becauſe we are aſſured it was moſt uſual; not that there was an impoſſibility of other Methods, but that theſe were beſt adapted to Humane Infirmities. And therefore it is worth obſerving upon this Occaſion, what Truth Himſelf mentions, as a Prerogative, by which <hi>Moſes</hi> was diſtinguiſhed from other Prophets: <hi>In that God talked with him Face to Face, as a Man talketh to his Friend;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Deut. xii.</note> that is, Eaſily and Familiarly, without any of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Commotions of Body, or extatick Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Soul, which the reſt of Mankind us'd to feel upon ſuch Occaſions. And this proves, both that the Other Method was ſo ordinary as to juſtifie our Author's Obſervation; and yet that there was no utter Incapacity for this freer way, in Humane Nature, (which deſerved this additional Remark upon it); for God, who is abſolute Maſter of Nature, can reveal himſelf in what manner he ſees ſit.</q>

And at this rate, the greateſt part of Mankind are only good by Chance. Which gives the true Reaſon of their being ſo extremely various, and unequal, and ſickle, and inconſiſtent with Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſo muſt all things needs be, that are govern'd by Impulſe and Accident; and nothing but true and well-weigh'd Principles, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Duty and Reaſon, can produce a ſteddy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and uniform Virtue.</item>

We cannot pretend that this Coldneſs always proceeds from Apprehenſions of Revenge; for perhaps the injur'd Party hath no ſuch Thought, and is as kindly diſpoſed to Us, as ever: But the Reaſon ſeems to be, that the very Sight and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him accuſes Us to our Selves, and our Conſcience takes theſe Occaſions to fly in our Faces, and reproach our Baſeneſs and Indiſcretion.

For all the Pains and Trouble you give your ſelf to inſtruct theſe Men better, is but ſo much Time and Labour loſt upon them: They are ſo much in the Wrong, and ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that none who differ from them can be in the Right, that no good is ever to be done. If you will take Their Judgments, none are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to themſelves for <hi>Virtue</hi> or for <hi>Wiſdom. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Self-ſufficiency,</hi> which every where hath too great an Aſcendent, reigns Abſolute here, and is in its proper Kingdom. Whoever hath once drunk in the Infection of theſe Evils, there are little or no Hopes left of ever making him a ſound Man again. For what is there more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely fooliſh, what more ſtiff and inflexible than theſe Fellows? They are ſecur'd by a double Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier from the Conqueſts of Reaſon and Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Firſt, by their Weakneſs, and Natural Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which diſables them from ſeeing the Strength of Arguments and Reproofs; and then, by a falſe Confidence in their own Excellencies above the reſt of the World, which makes them deſpiſe all Others, as their Inferiours, unable to adviſe, and unfit to reform Thoſe, who are already ſo much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and better than They.</p>

                        </note> they are highly Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, and dangerous Enemies to True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They diſguiſe themſelves with a Mask of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53648:213"/>Piety, and Zeal, and Reverence, and Love for God; and this Jeſt they carry ſo far, as to teaze and torment themſelves with Auſterities and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that were never requir'd at their Hands. And what is to be done with ſuch infatuated Wretches as Theſe, who imagine that thoſe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Afflictions are highly meritorious; that the Almighty is indebated to them, and much oblig'd by Works which he never commanded; and that all the reſt ought to be releaſed in conſideration of Theſe? Tell them, they take things by the wrong Handle; that they ſtretch, and pervert, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand the Scriptures, and lay Burdens upon themſelves, more and heavier than God ever laid. Their Anſwer is, that They intend well; (and that Intention they doubt not will Save them) that what they do is from a Principle of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and cannot want Merit and Acceptance upon that Account. Beſides, there is ſomething of Intereſt in all this, which you can never prevail with them to part with; for what Gain is to be propoſed in Proſpect, what Satisfaction to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in Preſent, which can make them amends for the mighty Expectations and Raptures of that fond Notion, that by this means God becomes Their <hi>Debtor,</hi> and they <hi>merit</hi> at His Hands?</p>

Here you ſhall ſee an old griping Jew, that hath brought God knows how many Families to Beggery and Ruine; but he hath done no hurt in all this: For he never asked for
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53648:213"/>more than his Own, at leaſt what he thought ſo; and if upon theſe Demands, Arreſts, and Suits, and Priſons have enſu'd, yet he only ſuffer'd the Law to take its Courſe; and who can blame this honeſt Man for coming by his Right in the way of Juſtice? But O Good God! how many good things are neglected, and how many wicked and barbarous things done, under the pretence of <hi>Forms,</hi> and the Protection of the <hi>Laws!</hi> Nothing can be truer, than that <hi>Extremity of Right is Extremity of Wrong.</hi> He that makes This the Rule of all his Proceedings, and allows himſelf to take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Law upon every occaſion, is ſo far from an <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> that he is one of the moſt <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Knaves.</hi> Such Reaſon was there for that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us'd to this purpoſe, <hi>God deliver us from the Formaliſts.</hi>

There are not in the World a Pack of more little Mercenary Wretches, more unfit for Buſineſs, and yet at the ſame time more forward, and preſuming, and conceited of Themſelves. Hence perhaps it is, that in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and all Languages, <hi>Pedant</hi> and <hi>Scholar</hi> are Terms of <hi>Ridicule</hi> and <hi>Reproach.</hi> To do a thing aukwardly, is to do it like a <hi>Scholar.</hi> To behave one's ſelf like a Clown, and be ignorant of the World, is to be a <hi>mere Scholar.</hi> Such Scholars I mean as Theſe I am now treating of; for theſe Reflections do not concern Learned Men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but ſuch ſuperficial Pretenders to it, as are only walking and living <hi>Nomenclatures;</hi> that have a Memory ſtuff'd full of Other Men's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

Now we ſhall do well to conſider this <hi>Preſumption</hi> in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſpects, above, below, upon the level, within, and without us. As the Object is God, and the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53648:214"/>Celeſtial Bodies, Terreſtrial Bodies, and Beaſts; Man our Equal, and our own Selves: And the whole Matter will turn at laſt upon theſe Two Points, The ſetting too high an Eſtimate upon our Own, and too low upon Other Things; Every Man in this Senſe deſerving the Character given by our Bleſſed Saviour, of the <hi>Phariſees, They truſted in Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deſpiſed Others.</hi> A Word or two now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each of the fore-mentioned Particulars.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And Firſt, with regard to Almighty God, (it is a horrible and melancholy Truth,<note place="margin">Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God.</note> but true it is, that) all Superſtition and falſe Worſhip, the affected Exceſſes, and the Wilful Defects in our Religious Services, are entirely owing to the want of a ſufficient Eſteem and Reverence for God; the not being ſenſible what ſort of Being He is, and entertaining ſuch Opinions and Idea's of the Divine Nature, as are not ſufficiently lofty, and pure, and refined. Now by ſaying <hi>ſufficiently</hi> ſo, I would not be underſtood, that our Apprehenſions ſhould bear any proportion to the Eſſential Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Majeſty; for God is Infinite, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no proportion at all. Conſequently there is no poſſibility in Nature, that our Conceptions ſhould ever ſoar up to ſuch a height and <hi>ſufficiency</hi> as This; And therefore I mean that <hi>ſufficiency</hi> only to be wanting, which Nature hath made us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and Duty requires from us. We do not raiſe nor direct our Minds, nor dart our Thoughts ſtrong, or high enough, when we form Notions of the Divinity: Alas! why do I ſay, not high and ſtrong enough? when it is but too evident, and our Actions ſpeak it out, that we entertain very feeble, and mean, and low Apprehenſions of him. And we ſerve him indeed accordingly; we offer him Things moſt unworthy of him, and deal with him more baſely and diſreſpectfully, than we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or dare, to do, with ſeveral of his Creatures.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53648:215"/>We diſcourſe, not of his <hi>Works</hi> only, (which yet command ſome Regard becauſe they are His) but we talk of his <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> determine his <hi>Will,</hi> interpret his <hi>Judgments,</hi> paſs Sentence upon the <hi>Diſpenſations of his Providence,</hi> and all this more peremptorily, more ſawcily, than any Man of good Manners would take upon him to do, with the Counſels and Proceedings of his Prince. And yet every one thinks he may make bold with his God in Caſes, where to uſe the ſame Freedoms with any Perſon of Honour, would be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for inſufferable Rudeneſs and Contempt. A great many Men would reject ſuch Service and Homage, and think themſelves highly injured and affronted, if we ſhould talk ſo manly of them, and make uſe of their Name upon ſuch trifling Occaſions, and in ſo contemptuous a manner as we do that of God. We undertake to manage him, go about to flatter and careſs, to bend and bring him over, to bribe and to compound with him; nay, I might tremble to ſay it, ſome think even to brave and dare him, to ſnarle and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to take things ill, and be exceeding angry at him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had his Pilot hoiſt Sails boldly, and fear nothing tho' Winds and Seas, and Stars and Fate were againſt him, but buoy himſelf up with this Confidence, in oppoſition to all Difficulties, <hi>That He who had</hi> Caeſar <hi>aboard, could not miſcarry. Auguſtus,</hi> after having been Tempeſt-beaten at Sea, took upon him, to ſet <hi>Neptune</hi> at Definance, and by way of Revenge, ordered his Image to be taken away from among the reſt of the Gods, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſolemn Proceſſion at the <hi>Ludi Circenſes.

And there goes a

He is lodged here in the laſt and loweſt Story of the World, at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Aetherial Roof; a place, that in compariſon of the purer Regions above us, may be call'd the Sink of the World, where all the Lees and Dregs ſettle, with Creatures of the meaneſt Condition, and liable to receive all thoſe Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rain and Vapours, which fall down upon his Head; nay, from Theſe he receives his very Subſiſtence; he lies open to Accidents, that beſet and oppreſs him on every Side; and yet this poor Wretch looks upon himſelf as the Maſter and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the Univerſe. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Almighty God hath given him a Dominion over ſome of his Fellow Creatures; and it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe true, that the reſt over which he hath not the ſame Dominion, are contriv'd for his Mighty Benefit and Covenience; but it will not follow
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53648:217"/>from hence, that the whole Creation had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End than his Service; nor that thoſe vaſt Globes of Light, and ſo many Pure Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bodies, whoſe leaſt Virtue is not diſtinctly known, and which he muſt be content to gaze at with Wonder and Aſtoniſhment, were fram'd and are continued in this Regularity and Perpetuity of Motion, for Man only. From hence, it is confeſt, this Indigent Wretch derives his Food, his Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and unſpeakable Conveniences; The Rays, the Beauty, the Heat of the Sun, The Rain, and Dew, and other Diſtillations from Heaven cheriſh and ſuſtain him; and This, no doubt, was one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the bountiful God that made them. But ſhall we preſume to determine from hence, that this was the Sole Intent and Uſe of them? Shall we call the Heavens and the Elements our Own, and pretend that Their Motions are only ſo many Tasks for Our Profit? This were, as if the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould call himſelf Proprietor of the Wealth out of which he is reliev'd; and the Benefits in this Caſe are ſo general, ſo far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Man alone, that the meaneſt Fowl of the Air may as well make the ſame Pretenſions; Nay, in ſome Senſe, theſe Creatures may make them better; For Man, who receives Conveniences, hath ſome Inconveniences too from the Bodies above him; he hath none of them at his own Diſpoſal, he cannot underſtand how far their Efficacy will extend; nor make any certain Concluſions, what will be hereafter; and this puts him into perpetual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes, and Fears and Amazements, leſt theſe Bodies ſhould not keep their Courſe, nor ſhed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous Influences, but occaſion Barren and ſickly Seaſons, and ſo every thing ſhould prove Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in Confuſion; and under the Weight of theſe Apprehenſions he lies and trembles, for what ſhall fall upon him from Thoſe very Bodies, of

Forgetting, that they are form'd by the Hands of the ſame Almighty Artificer, and are reckoned among the Riches and Poſſeſſions of the ſame Lord; That the ſame Earth is our Common Mother, and that They and He, are of the ſame Family; and conſequently ought not to be ſlighted and diſdained, as if they were worthy no part of his Concern, nor bore any Relation at all to Him. Hence it is, that theſe Poor Creatures are ſo much abuſed; and treated with an Inſolence and Cruelty, that flies back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Their and Our Common Maſter; for it is
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53648:218"/>an Affront, and an Impiety, to deal thus by any Thing of His making, ſuch as he does not only Own, but expreſſs a Tenderneſs for; thinks them worthy his own Care, and hath appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws for their Benefit and Preſervation; ſuch as, tho' inferiour to Us in the moſt valuable Parts, yet he ſeems in ſome Things to have given the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to; nay, ſuch, as in ſeveral Inſtances, ſhame and reproach our Follies, and are therefore recommended in Scripture, as Maſters for Man to be ſent to School to.

                     <p>It is indeed a Doctrine commonly received, that <hi>the World was made for Man, and Man for God;</hi> which in ſome Senſe is certainly true, and what I have ſaid is no derogation from it. For, beſides that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which all the Creatures in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to, whether thoſe, Above or Below us; Thoſe uſeful Hints and Reflections they miniſter concerning Almighty God, Our Selves, and Our Duty: Some ſort of Uſe, with regard to Profit, or Serviceableneſs, or Delight, may be drawn from every one of them in particular. From that Part Above us, which we have a leſs diſtinct Knowledge of, and which is not at all in our Diſpoſal; This Firmament ſo nobly Vaulted, ſo richly deckt with Light, and all thoſe rolling Fires above us; The Advantage Man receives from Them is That of <hi>Contemplation</hi> only. His Soul by Theſe is raiſed and tranſported to admire and to love, to fear and to honour, and to pay moſt profound Reverence to the Almighty Maſter and Maker of ſo Glorious a Frame.

But for Men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves, that God in making all theſe Things, had no other End in his Thoughts and Deſigns, but purely to conſult the Convenience of Mankind; This is too great a Stretch upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine mentioned juſt now, and an Arrogance which I think may very deſervedly be charged with all that Folly and Preſumption I have laid upon it.</p>

He that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an Opinion, reckons it a work of Charity to win others over, and convince as many as he can of it too; and for the better effecting this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Deſign, he gives it all the Strength and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he can; repreſents every thing in its beſt Light, and adds from his own Invention, as much more, as he thinks may be for his Purpoſe, to make amends for any Defect or Oppoſition, which he ſuſpects may be met with, from the Apprehenſion of the Perſon he propoſes the Matter to. And, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, there is not any thing for which Men are more tenderly concern'd, than for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about their Opinions, and gaining as many Proſelytes as they can.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nemo ſibi tantum errat, ſed aliis erroris cauſa &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor eſt.</note>

And, for the facilitating this Deſign, and to captivate Men's Underſtandings, they make uſe of Two Artifices. The Firſt is, to lay down ſome general Propoſitions, which are term'd <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles;</hi> and ſuch as muſt be preſuppoſed and granted on all hands; and from Theſe they tell you, you muſt be ſo far from departing, that you are not allow'd ſo much as to Diſpute, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt Doubt, whether they be true or not. Upon Theſe they raiſe what Superſtructure they pleaſe, and ſo bring the World over to their ſide; which hath been a very ſucceſsful Cheat, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating many groſs Errours, and giving Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Things abſolutely falſe. And indeed the Fraud lies chiefly in Thoſe Principles, which ought to be <hi>Truths Self-evident,</hi> and clear to every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man; but Some have been advanced for ſuch, which upon ſtrict examination will be found, not only as diſputable, but as weak, as falſe, as any of the Concluſions endeavour'd to be drawn from them; and the Propoſitions contrary to Theſe, carry at leaſt the ſame Face of Probability, and have as much to ſay for themſelves.</p>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53648:222"/>unconteſtable, but what God hath been pleaſed to reveal; the reſt are mere Vanity and Pretence, that challenge Aſſent ſo imperiouſly from us. Now theſe Gentlemen require us to take their Word, and ſwallow All they ſet before us, without chewing; not any Tryal or Examination is allow'd you, which is the greateſt Injuſtice and Tyranny in the World. God (as was obſerved before) hath this Right incommunicable to any beſide Himſelf, to command our Aſſent in all he ſays, upon this ſcore merely, <hi>becauſe he ſays it.</hi> Where, by God's ſaying it, is included the Meſſage of all thoſe that are ſent, and atteſted by him, and not any immediate Revelation intended, and nothing elſe; for in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſuch Meſſengers, ſo commiſſioned and approv'd it is, that our Lord ſays, <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf is a Lyar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Other Method, by which many have been drawn into Errours, is by counterfeiting this Seal from Heaven, pretending ſome new Miracle, or particular Inſpiration, or ſtrange Apparition, or the like; a Trick, which Hiſtory tells us, hath been often play'd with great Dexterity and Succeſs, by Princes, and Law-givers, and Generals of Armies. The firſt Perſuaſion taken from the Party concern'd, ſoon gets poſſeſſion of the weaker ſort; but this is ſo nice, ſo feeble, and ſo frail, that the leaſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, or Miſmanagement would ſpoil and break all to pieces again: And wonderful it is to reflect, what famous Impreſſions have been owing to poor and frivolous Beginnings. But when this Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion comes abroad into the World, it grows to a prodigious Bulk, and ſtretches it ſelf ſo, by the help of Time and Numbers, as to take in Men of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Senſe, and more diſcerning Judgments. For it is to no purpoſe then to kick againſt a general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; a Man hath nothing left to do, but to come in, and make One. The ſtrongeſt Evidence, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53648:223"/>moſt diſtinguiſhing Teſt of Truth, is the number of Believers, and the number of Years that have maintained it: And yet it is certain, that <hi>Fools</hi> are more than <hi>half the World</hi> in every Age. But, notwithſtanding this diſparity, it is a hard matter to fix in an Opinion, contrary to the general Senſe of Mankind. The Fallacy however laſt-mention'd hath been abundantly ſeen in the many Juggles and Cheats which have aſtoniſh'd the Multitude, and been palmed upon them for new Miracles; but by ſome Accident or other, or by a nicer Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome more jealous and acute than the reſt, the whole Cheat hath been detected and expoſed within a very little while; and yet Theſe very Cheats, if they had gather'd Strength, and not been ſtifled in their Infancy, had done their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and met with Wonder and Adoration every where. Theſe Diſcoveries however of falſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſuch as are taken upon Truſt, are a greater Confirmation of the True, ſuch as the Faith of Chriſtians is built upon; which have neither want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Time to ripen them, nor Curioſity of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to detect them, nor the Malice of Enemies to pervert and overthrow them, nor the Byaſs of Wicked Inclinations to render Men averſe from ſurrendring themſelves up to the Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them. And yet in deſpite of all Theſe, They did, and do, and will continue to prevail and triumph in the Minds of Men. And well it were, if better Care were taken to examine all Pretenſions of this kind very nicely, that ſo the True might not ſuffer in their Reputation and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for want of being diſtinguiſh'd from the Falſe; and That poor Shift of profane Wretches might be expoſed and beaten down, who take ſhelter in ſome ſuch Diſcoveries as have been here mention'd, and, from a Few acknowledged Impoſtures, and ſome Others which look ſuſpiciouſly, and perhaps, if
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53648:223"/>carefully traced up to their firſt Head, might have been found no better, endeavour to inſinuate, that None ever were otherwiſe. It muſt be confeſt, in the mean while, that the Things theſe Tricks are contriv'd to ſupport, and lead Men into, are a mortifying Conſideration; the great Variety of contending Sects and Religions, and the infinite Superſtitions ſtill in uſe among ſome parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the Ceremonies, and corrupt Cuſtoms which are Relicks of <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry, and which there is no bringing the People off from. And now, by this whole Diſcourſe, we ſee what precious Creatures we are, and what we are like to come to at laſt, when we blindly follow ſuch blind Leaders.</p>

                     <p>THere is not any One thing in all this lower World, wherein ſo great Variety is obſervable, as in Mankind; not any general Head or Species of Beings, whoſe Individuals differ in ſo many, and ſo diſtant Particulars from one another. If <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> may be credited; There are Men in ſome places, whoſe Form and Figure bears but very little Reſemblance to this of Ours; and ſeveral Mongrels and Medleys between the Man and the Beaſt. Some Countries are inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Men without any Head, whoſe Eyes and Mouth are placed in their Breaſts; ſome by Hermaphrodites; ſome, where they go upon all Four; ſome, where they have but One Eye, and That in the middle of their Forehead; and a Head ſhaped
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53648:224"/>more like a Dog, than ſuch as we ſee Men uſually have. Some Places, where the lower part is all Fiſh, and they live in the Water; where their Women bring Children at Five Years old, and live no longer than Eight; where their Skull and Forehead is ſo hard, that no Iron can break or enter it, but rebounds back again; where they are transformed into Wolves, and Sheep, and Oxen, and at laſt return to the Humane Form again; where they have no Mouth, and all the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are ſuſtained by, is from the Smell of certain Scents. And, to go no farther, This very laſt Age hath diſcovered, and many now living have ſeen and felt Men, that have no Beards at all; that live without the uſe of Fire, or Corn, or Wine; and Countries, where what We abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as the moſt odious Deformity, is lookt upon and valu'd as the moſt exquiſite Beauty; (as hath been hinted before) As for the Diverſity of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Manners, That will be the Buſineſs of another Head. What hath been related here may poſſibly ſeem incredible; but if it do, our Point will be prov'd without it. For go no farther than our own Knowledge, and what infinite Diſſerences are there in <hi>Faces?</hi> inſomuch that Two are no where to be found, exactly and in all Particulars alike. 'Tis true, ſometimes there happen Miſtakes of one Perſon for another, becauſe of a very great Likeneſs between them; but then Theſe always happen, when One of the Parties is not by. For when we meet them Both together, the Errour vaniſhes; and we eaſily diſcern a Difference, which ſerves for a ſufficient Mark of Diſtinction to us, tho' perhaps it is ſuch a one, as we cannot readily tell what to call it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Souls</hi> of Men are yet more various, and full of diſtinguiſhing Characters, than their <hi>Bodies;</hi> For there is in this reſpect, not only a greater Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53648:225"/>between Man and Man, than any that can be diſcover'd between Beaſt and Beaſt: But (which is but a bad Buſineſs, and not much for our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) the diſtance is more between Some Men and Others, than it ſeems to be between ſome Men and Beaſts. For one of the moſt excellent and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Animals, ſeems to make much nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Underſtanding and Sagacity of Men of the loweſt Form; than Thoſe Men to ſome of the moſt capable and accompliſh'd Perſons. Now this mighty Difference between Men proceeds from inward and unſeen Cauſes; from the Mind, which conſiſts of ſuch variety of Parts; and it is brought about by ſuch intricate Springs and Principles of Motion, that the Contemplation of them would be infinite, and the Degrees depending upon them without Number.</p>
                     <p>Now the Laſt part of our Undertaking for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a right Knowledge of Man, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the Diſtinctions and Differences obſervable in Him: And Theſe are of ſeveral ſorts, according to the different Parts of which Humane Nature is compounded, and the different Methods and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities in which Men may be conſider'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with one another. At preſent we will inſtance in Five, which ſeem to be the Principal; and of ſo large Extent, that all the reſt may be reduc'd to them. For, generally ſpeaking, all that is in Man is either Body or Spirit, Natural or Acquired, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Private, Apparent or Secret; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Fifth and Laſt Conſideration ſhall branch it ſelf into Five Particulars, which ſhall be ſo many Capital Diſtinctions between Man and Man.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe is <hi>Natural, Eſſential,</hi> and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal;</hi> in which the whole Man, both Body and Mind, are concern'd.</p>
                     <p>The Second is principally <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> but in ſome meaſure <hi>Artificial</hi> and acquir'd
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53648:225"/>too; and this concerns the Strength and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>The Third is <hi>Accidental,</hi> and depends upon Men's Conditions and their Duties reſpectively; the Ground of all which is taken from the Circumſtance of Superiour or Inferiour.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is likewiſe <hi>Accidental,</hi> and relates to Men's particular Profeſſions, and different ways of Living.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth and Laſt conſiders them with regard to the <hi>Advantages</hi> and <hi>Diſadvantages,</hi> by which either Nature or Fortune hath diſtinguiſhed them.</p>

                        <p>THE Firſt, moſt remarkable, and univerſal Diſtinction between Some Men and Others, is That which regards the whole Perſon, the Mind and Body both, and all the Parts whereof Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.

As to thoſe Differences, which relate to the Body; we have Evidence of Senſe for them, and our Eyes ſupply the Place of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arguments. If there be ſome excepted Caſes from the general Rules, they may very eaſily be accounted for, (though indeed theſe Exceptions are but very few.) The mingling and promiſcuous Marriages of ſeveral Nations; the Winds, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and particular Situation of the Places where they dwell, may each of them contribute to it, and all together may make a conſiderable Alteration. Thus a very high and mountainous Country may vary remarkably, from a flat under the ſame Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; nay, this different Site may cauſe ſome Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in the very ſame Countrey or City. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> obſerves, that the Humours of Thoſe who were born and dwelt in the upper Town at <hi>Athens,</hi> were very diſtant from Thoſe of the lower Town, and by the Sea-Side about the <hi>Piraeean</hi> Port. A high Mountain on the North-Side of a Valley, will render the Plain to the Southward of it, to all Intents and Purpoſes a Southern Climate; and by the ſame Reaſon a Mountain to the Southward, which intercepts the Sun, will give the Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it the Effects of a Northern Climate.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for thoſe Differences, which relate to the Mind; <note place="margin">Their Mind</note> We know very well, that Mechanical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and moſt Laborious and Handicraft Arts come out of the North, where the People are remarkable for indefatigable Induſtry, and Toil. But Learning and Speculative Sciences, move with the Sun, and come from the South to Us. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the Antients give the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> the Character of a moſt Ingenious, and exceeding Subtle People; and the Scripture takes Notice, as one Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53648:228"/>and great Accompliſhment of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he had been inſtructed,<note place="margin">Acts vii. 26.</note> and was <hi>well skilled in all the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Aegyptians.</hi> From thence firſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy ſet forward into <hi>Europe;</hi> for the <hi>Greeks</hi> were beholding to <hi>Aegypt</hi> for the Fundamentals and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Wiſdom. Greatneſs and State ſeems to have begun There, by reaſon of the Vigour and Subtilty of their Parts. The Guards of Princes, even of Them whoſe Dwellings and Dominions are in the South, are uſually compoſed of Northerly Men; as being look d upon to have more Strength of Body, and leſs of Mind; fit for Fight and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but not qualify'd for ſubtle Plots and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns, nor diſpoſed to Treachery and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. What was ſaid of <hi>Hanibal,</hi> is true of theſe Southern Nations, They are of a Diſpoſition that will ſerve for Great Vices, and Great Virtues, and may be eminent in Either: That which is Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commendable in the Northern, is Good-Nature, and Plainneſs, and Undeſigning Honeſty. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Sciences, ſuch as are mix'd, partly Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, and partly Practical; Politicks (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) and Laws, and Eloquence, and the like, are owing to the Middle Regions between thoſe Extremes, and moſt conſpicuous and improved there. For it is obſervable, that the Greateſt and moſt Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Empires, and States, have been ſeated in this Part of the World.</p>

The Nations which ſet out from thence, <hi>Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Hunns,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi> Theſe have fought, and ſubdued all other Nations, and ravag'd the whole World. The Devaſtations they made, and the Barbarities they exerciſed, gave Occaſion to that Proverb, That <hi>all Evil came out of the North.</hi> Duels, and ſet Combats, are deriv'd from Them. <hi>Solinus</hi> ſays, the Northern Nations Worſhip the Blade of a Sword, ſtuck down into the Earth. Other People have not been able to Conquer them; Not even the <hi>Romans,</hi> who vanquiſhed the reſt of the World, but were Themſelves overcome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by Them. It is remarkable, that the South Wind makes them Weak and Faint, and that in Proportion as they advance nearer the South, they Degenerate and grow Feeble; and ſo juſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, The Southern Nations, when they move North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, improve their Conſtitutions, and feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grow much more Hardy and Strong. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of this Courage and Warlike Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it is, that the Northern People cannot endure to be Inſulted and Tyrannized over; They are Enemies to Arbitrary Power, and Abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; are great Lovers of Liberty; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit moſt willingly where the Governments are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. As for Chaſtity and Jealouſie; In the North One Man hath but One Wife, (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves) and he thinks One Wife ſufficient too; They are by no Means inclin'd to Jealouſie, (ſays <hi>Munſter</hi>)
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53648:229"/>as one may gueſs by Men and their Wives Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the Company of Strangers. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy is practiſed all over the whole Southern Tract. All <hi>Africa,</hi> (ſays <hi>Solinus</hi>) is devoted to the Worſhip of <hi>Venus.</hi> Southern Men have a ſtrange Propenſion to Jealouſie, and even die with the Rage of it; and therefore they get Eunuchs for their Security, and ſet Them as a Guard upon their Women. Thus the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> does in his Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, where he keeps vaſt Numbers of Ladies, (like a Stable of Mares) to breed upon.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Cruelty</hi> both Extremes reſemble one another; but though the <hi>Effect</hi> be the ſame, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is not ſo; as will be explain'd preſently, when we come to conſider the Cauſes of theſe Differences. The moſt Barbarous Methods of Puniſhment, ſuch as Breaking upon the Wheel, and Impaling Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, came from the North. The Mercileſs Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> are abundantly Notorious; The <hi>Germans</hi> (<hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us) never puniſh Malefactors by Legal Proceſs, but fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and cut them to Pieces like Enemies. The Southern Nations too flay their Criminals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and their Deſire of Revenge is ſo Eager and Impatient, that ſometimes they run Stark-Mad, if they cannot find Means to ſatisfie it. Between theſe Moſt Diſtant Regions, the Nations are full of Kindneſs, and Good-Nature. The <hi>Romans</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inflicted no greater Puniſhment, than that of Baniſhing their moſt grievous Offenders. The <hi>Greeks</hi> mingled a Stupifying Draught of Hemlock, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poyſonous Drugs, yet ſo that it ſhould be Sweet upon the Palate; and This they gave their condemned Perſons to drink, and die with. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, That Humanity, and Courteſie, ſeem to be the Portion and peculiar Qualities of the <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> and to have been from thence diffuſed over the reſt of the World.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now, the True Cauſe, from whence all theſe Differences, <note place="margin">The Cauſe of theſe Differences.</note> both in the Perſons and the Diſpoſitions of Men, proceed; is no other than the inward Natural Heat, being diſtributed among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe ſeveral Climates, ſo very unequally as it is: For each Country differs from the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as theſe Proportions differ. The Northern Nations have it in a very great Degree, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Coldneſs of their Air, which keeps this Heat, and ſhuts it up cloſe; as we find Cellars in Rocks and deep Wells, Hotteſt in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, to go no farther from Home, ſo are our own Breaſt and Stomach, becauſe of the Strength and Abundance of inward Heat at that Time. Now, This muſt needs be much Weaker in Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern People, becauſe the exceeding Vehemence of the Scorching Heat without, and the Force of the Sun-Beams ſcatters, and draws it outward. As our Stomachs and Places under Ground are cooleſt in Summer, and we feel our inward Burnings abated by Sweating. From this Difference, I ſay, and unequal Degrees of Natural Heat, ariſe the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Differences already mentioned; not ſuch only as the Body is concern'd in, for Theſe are Viſible and Obvious; but Thoſe that make a Change in the Minds of Men too: For the Southerly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being Colder in their Conſtitutions, are from hence diſpoſed to Melancholy; and this makes them Staid and Solid, Conſtant, Contemplative, Ingenious, Wiſe, Religious, and Devout. For Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Docility is moſt eminently Viſible in Beaſts of a Cold Temperament; as Elephants par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, which are more Melancholick than any other Animals, and are manifeſtly the moſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and apt of any, all which I impute to the Coldneſs of their Blood. From the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and Predominance of Melancholy in their Temper, the Southern People ſeem to be more
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53648:230"/>Laſcivious, and Luſtful than others, this being a ſharp, and fretting Humour, and apt to provoke ſuch Inclinations; as we ſee it in Hares particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. From the ſame ſharp, fretting Melancholy, they are Barbarous and Cruel; for That Whets the Paſſions, and urges them to Blood and Revenge. Now The Northern People, in whoſe Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Phlegm is moſt predominant, and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Blood and Spirits; are juſt oppoſite to the Former, and have the direct contrary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; excepting that they agree in that ſingle Point of Cruelty. But This in theſe Parts of the World proceeds chiefly from a very different Reaſon; and that ſeems to be Want of Judgment; ſo that, like Beaſts, They are Strong in their Paſſions, and Weak in thoſe Faculties, that ſhould controul, and keep them in. The Countries of the Middle Diviſion, abound in Blood and Choler, and ſo are delivered from the Ill Effects of both Extremes, Phlegm, and Melancholy; and accordingly Theſe are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in their Paſſions, Good-Humour'd, Cheerful, Nimble, and Apt, and Active.</p>
                        <p>It were Poſſible to repreſent the different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Spirit of theſe Three Sorts of People, after a yet more Nice and perfect Manner, by making the Application and Compariſon to extend to all kind of Things whatſoever; A ſhort Scheme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this little Table will preſent you with; and by That you will perceive, what are the particular Qualities, Influences, Improvements, and Actions of each of them.

The Nations that lie Weſtward, and the People that dwell upon the Mountains, approach, and have a great Affinity to the Northern Climates; becauſe of the Cold, to which thoſe Situations are more expos'd; which is alſo the Caſe of Them who live at a great diſtance from the Sea. They are War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Fierce, Lovers of Liberty, and have more Honeſty and Simplicity in their Tempers. And ſo again, the Eaſtern Countries reſemble the Southern, as do alſo Thoſe that dwell in the Champaign and great Valleys, and the Borderers upon the Sea. They are more Tender and Effeminate, by reaſon of the Fruitfulneſs of their Soil; for Fertility inclines Men to Softneſs and Pleaſure. And your Iſlanders are commonly Subtle, and Cunning, and Deceitful, by reaſon of that Commerce and Correſpondence they hold with Men and Nations of different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers abroad.</p>
                        <p>From this whole Diſcourſe we may conclude in general, that the Privilege of the Northern Climates lies chiefly in the Qualifications of the Body; Strength, and a Robuſt Conſtitution is their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Excellence and Portion. The Southern have the Advantage in the Mind; Subtilty, and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and Quickneſs of Parts, is Their Talent. The Middle Regions have ſomewhat of Both, and partake of all Theſe Excellencies; but of Each in leſs Degrees and moderate Proportions. From hence likewiſe we may underſtand, that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Original Diſpoſitions of Men, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, are not Vices or Virtnes in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Neceſſary and Natural Effects.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53648:231"/>out of our Power. But the ſweetning, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and reducing theſe Natural Extremes to Temper, and a due Medium; the watching over them carefully, and reſtraining their Motions, This is properly our Duty, and the Buſineſs of Wiſdom and Virtue.</p>

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THis Second Diſtinction, which concerns the Minds of Men, <note place="margin">Three Sorts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men in the World.</note> and their inward Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, is by no means ſo manifeſt as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: It is not obvious to Senſe at all, nor does it fall within the compaſs of every one's Notice and Obſervation. The Cauſes of it are likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; for it depends partly upon Nature, and partly upon Induſtry and Art; and ſo extends to our Acquir'd Excellencies, as well as to Thoſe that are born and bred with us. According to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, there are (as was obſerv'd before) Three ſorts of Men, which divide them into Three Claſſes or Degrees of Souls.</p>
                        <p>In the Firſt and loweſt of theſe Ranks we may place thoſe weak and mean Souls, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of a Level with Body and Matter; of ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and narrow Capacities; almoſt perfectly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and ſuch as Nature ſeems to have made on purpoſe to Endure and Obey; to live under Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Management, and tamely to follow
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53648:232"/>their Leaders; In a Word, ſuch as are <hi>but juſt Men,</hi> and <hi>no more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Second and middle Row, are Thoſe of a tolerable Judgment and Underſtanding, and ſuch as make ſome Pretenſions to Wit and Learning, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and Addreſs: Theſe Men know Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they are not ſufficiently acquainted with Themſelves; They are content to take up with Opinions commonly receiv'd, and ſtick faſt to their firſt Impreſſions, without troubling Themſelves, or indeed being judicious enough, to enquire into the Truth, and Bottom of Things; nay, were they capable of finding their deep and moſt abſtruſe Cauſes, they think this an unlawful Curioſity, and ſo make the Submiſſion of their Judgments a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Duty and Conſcience. They look no farther than that little Spot of Ground where they ſtand Themſelves, and take it for granted, that Matters are, or ought to be, all the World over, exactly the ſame with what they ſee them at home; and all that differ from them in <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> or <hi>Opinion,</hi> they look upon with <hi>Pity</hi> or <hi>Diſdain;</hi> and allow no better Names to, than <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Unciviliz'd, Wild</hi> and <hi>Barbarons.</hi> They live in perfect Slavery to local Laws, and the Vogue of that Village or City where they have dwelt ever ſince they were hatch'd; and this they do, not only in a quiet Complyance, and orderly Obedience to them, (which it is the Duty of every Man, even the ableſt and moſt judicious, to do) but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Senſe, and their Soul to them; and are verily perſuaded, that what is believ'd and practis'd in their own Town, is the <hi>infallible Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Truth;</hi> the Only, or the Beſt Rule of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that all Men's Notions of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> ought to be meaſur'd by Theirs. Theſe ſorts of Men belong to the School and Diſtrict of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> They are Poſitive and Peremptory, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53648:232"/>in their own Senſe, and impatient of Contradiction: They look more at Convenience than Truth; and conſider what will make moſt for the Benefit of the World, and turn to beſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, rather than make it their Buſineſs to find Things as they really are, and recommend what is Beſt in it ſelf. This Claſs conſiſts of infinite Subdiviſions, great Variety of Attainments and Degrees; the Uppermoſt and moſt capable among them are ſuch as ſit at Helm, and govern the World; Thoſe that hold Empires and Kingdoms in their Hand, and either give Commands, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thoſe that do.</p>
                        <p>In the Third and Higheſt Order, are the Men bleſt with a lively, clear, and penetrating Wit; a ſound, ſolid, and ſtable Judgment; that do not content Themſelves with bare Hearſay, nor ſet up their Reſt in general and receiv'd Opinions; that ſuffer not their Minds to be prepoſſeſt and won o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by the publick Vogue, nor are at all kept in Awe, or afraid to oppoſe and diffent from the common Cry, as being very well ſatisfy'd, how many Cheats there are abroad in the World; and that ſome Things, no better than Falſhood and Jeſt at the bottom, have been entertain'd, approv'd, extoll'd, nay even reverenc'd and ador'd. For ſuch were the greateſt part of the old Philoſophy and Phyſick, ſuch the Divinations, and Oracles, and all the Idolatry and Trumpery of the Pagan Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; which prevail'd, even in the moſt refin'd Countries, for many Generations together, and kept Mankind in ſlavery to moſt wicked and miſerable Deluſions. Theſe Men therefore are for bringing every Thing to the Light, fathoming it to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, entring into mature and impartial Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without Paſſion or Prejudice; ſearching into its abſtruſeft Cauſes, its moſt ſecret Motives and Springs, and tracing them up to their firſt Head.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53648:233"/>They had much rather continue under the Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Doubt and Diſſatisfaction, and ſuſpend an Errour, and take up falſe Confidences, and ſtrong Perſuaſions of Things, which they have no ſufficient Ground to believe or affirm: For That is the effect of Lazineſs or Littleneſs of Soul; grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pains, or wanting the Courage to examine fairly; of Eaſineſs and Credulity, of an unſettled Judgment, or a raſh and haſty Determination. Theſe, alas! are but very Few; and may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd <hi>Retainers</hi> to <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato:</hi> They are grave and ſober, modeſt and reſerv'd; They have a greater reſpect to Truth, and the Reality of Things, than the Uſefulneſs and Convenience of them; and had much rather inform Themſelves and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rightly, than entertain or propagate a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, which might tend to their Service and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Now if Theſe have good Moral Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions withal; if all the Accompliſhments already mention'd, be crown'd with Integrity, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and Virtuous Living, They are then Wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, The very Perſons whoſe Character we are now enquiring after, and ſuch as this whole Treatiſe is intended to make Men. But we muſt not expect the World ſhould pay them all that Deference which is their due. For they diſoblige Mankind by forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the common Road, diffenting from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Notions and Rules; making new and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Diſcoveries, and not ſwallowing all that is brought to them without Chewing. This makes the Vulgar look upon them with a very jealous Eye, as dangerous Perſons; and to diſtinguiſh them by the Titles of <hi>Fanciful Men, Virtuoſi,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> in a particular and Abuſive Senſe of the Word.</p>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:53648:233"/>
                        <p> Now the Firſt of theſe Claſſes is abundantly more numerous than the Second; and ſo likewiſe the Second proportionably than the Third. Thoſe of the Firſt, and thoſe of the Laſt Order, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the ſublimeſt Souls, never trouble the World at all, nor make any Clutter or Diſturbance. The One are unqualify'd and unable, they are beneath, and want Strength to do it: The Other are as much above it, too wiſe, and too great, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to any Troubles of that kind. They have a ſufficiency and firmneſs in their own Mind, and are not concern'd for Things not worth their Care. Thoſe of the Middle Rank make all the Buſtle and Noiſe; The Diſputes, and Diſtractions, and Publick Commotions are all owing to Them. Their Condition and Temper diſpoſes them to it, which is poſitive and conceited, full of Vanity and Preſumption; always in action, and never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing elſe to be at reſt. Thoſe of the Loweſt Degree, are the very Dregs and Setling of Mankind, the Sink and Refuſe of the World; which, like the Lees, falls to the Bottom of its own accord; and may be compared to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Earth, which hath nothing to do, but to receive all that comes, and bear all that is caſt upon it from Above. The Second Stage is like the Region of the Air, where all thoſe Meteors are form'd, which crack about our Ears, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Changes of Seaſons and Weather, and all the Alterations that affect this lower World; and when they have terrify'd us with dreadful Noiſes and Expectations, at laſt diſſolve, and fall down upon the Earth. Thoſe of the Higheſt Quality are like the Firmament, thoſe Aethereal and Higher Regions, not far diſtant from Heaven it ſelf, which are always clear and ſerene, peaceable and pure.</p>
                        <pb n="400" facs="tcp:53648:234"/>
                        <p> This Difference between Some Men and Others, is in ſome degree owing to Nature, and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Diſpoſition; the firſt Compoſition and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Brain; which makes a mighty difference according to the predominance of Moiſt and Hot, and the ſeveral Proportions, in which each of theſe Qualities are mixt: For the Minds of Men, and their Underſtandings, will vary won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and they will be Judicious, Smart, Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; or Weak, Dull, and Cowards, according to the laying of theſe Foundations at firſt. But then the Building upon that Groundwork is the Buſineſs of Inſtruction and Diſcipline; Experience, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting acquainted with the World. So that theſe Diſtinctions are partly Artificial and Acquir'd too, and a Man's own Induſtry and Obſervation is of great Uſe, to diſabuſe his Mind, and bring it to a Manly Senſe of Things. I add upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we ſhall deceive our ſelves extremely, if we ſuppoſe any of theſe Claſſes conſin'd to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Profeſſions or Denominations of Men; for there are ſome of all ſorts in all Circumſtances and Characters; High and Low, Learned and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Good and Bad; ſome of the Meaneſt Souls in the Gown, and ſome of the laſt and moſt exalted Spirits in High Shoes; ſome of ſlender Capacities, but entirely Virtuous; and ſome of wonderful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Endowments, who are Monſters of Vice. So that indeed, as the Differences themſelves admit of great Variety, That of the ſeveral Degrees under each Diviſion, and the Diſpoſitions of the Perſons ſo diſtinguiſh'd, is inſinite and unconceivable.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is alſo another Diſtinction ſometimes made between Men, <note place="margin">Another Diſtinction</note> with regard to the Abilities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Accompliſhments of the Mind: For ſome are able to make their own Way, beat out a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage where there was no Path, no Light before;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53648:234"/>and are ſo become their own Maſters in Virtue and Wiſdom. Theſe are happy Men indeed; Men of the largeſt Size; and there are but few to whom Nature hath been ſo partially bountiful. Others have need of Aſſiſtance; and of Theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain there are Two ſorts. Some only want Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; if you do but light them, and ſhew them, it is ſufficient; They will follow readily of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But Others require more help; a Torch and a Guide is not enough for Them; They have need to be ſupported, and taken by the Hand: A kind Friend to draw and pull them forward, and a Spur ſometimes, to quicken them in their Pace. As for Thoſe, whom Nature hath furniſhed ſo ill, that they are incapable of Inſtruction and Amendment, (which is the Caſe of ſome in the Loweſt Claſs;) or Them who have corrupted Nature, and are grown reſtiff and intractable; (which is but too viſible in many of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Claſs,) I mention them not; for They (like Beaſts that will neither lead nor drive) can only be left to their own Ruine; deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, fool-hardy Wretches, of whom no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all is to be made, nor any Good to be expected.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This <hi>Publick Power,</hi> whether the Supreme, or the Subordinate, <note place="margin">Supreme Power Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided.</note> admits of ſeveral Subdiviſions, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary to be attended to. The Supreme, which as I obſerv'd, is of Three Sorts, according to the different Conſtitutions, and Methods of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, executes and exerts it ſelf in as many different ways, and each of Theſe according to the different Temper and Management, hath been diſtinguiſh'd by the Titles of <hi>Kingly, Arbitrary,</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical. Kingly</hi> is when the Supreme Power (be it lodged in one, or in more Hands) is it ſelf ſtrictly Obedient to the Laws of Nature, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and protects its Subjects, in their Natural Liberties, and Civil Rights. <hi>All Power, in general, belongs to Kings, particular Properties to private Men. The King is Univerſal Lord, and hath a Right Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moum; Others have the Right of Lordſhip and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Arbitrary Government</hi> is, when the Sovereign is Lord of Mens Perſons and Eſtates by Right of Conqueſt; and the Subjects are Governed without any Regard to Claims, or Laws, or Rights, but in an abſolate Way, as Lords uſe their Slaves. This is rather <hi>Bondage</hi> and Captivity; <hi>Subjection</hi> is too gentle a Name for it; where Lives are cut off, and Eſtates ſeized, and rack'd and taken away, at Pleaſure. <hi>Tyrannical Government</hi> is where the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign deſpiſes and diſregards all the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Original Rights of Mankind; and ſo does not only make uſe of, but abuſes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Poſſeſſions of the Subjects; and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the former Arbitrary way, much after the ſame manner, that a Robber differs from a Fair Enemy in the Field.</p>

                           <hi>Obedience</hi> is a Matter of Beneſit and Advantage; of Eaſe and Neceſſity; The Obeying well, is of the Two, more conducive to the Publick Peace, and Safety, than the Commanding wiſely; and the Conſequences of withſtanding and refuſing the Commands of our Superiours, or the complying with them Imperfectly and Negligently, are much more Dangerous and Deſtructive, than Ill and Improper Commands Themſelves are, or want of Skill to Govern. Juſt as in the Caſe of a Married Life, the Husband and Wife are equally obliged to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Affection and Fidelity to the Bed; and the Words in which they Solemnly engage for This, are the very Same for both Parties; the ſame Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Formalities to ſignifie and confirm it; but yet the Conſequences are by no means equal, but the Miſchiefs of Diſloyalty are incomparably More, and Greater in an Adulterous Wife, than an Adulterous Husband: So likewiſe <hi>Commanding</hi> and <hi>Obeying</hi> are equally Duties, and neceſſary in all manner of Societies which unite Men to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but yet the Diſobedience of the Subject draws much greater Inconveniences after it, than the Unskillfulneſs or the real Faults of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Several States and Kingdoms have held out a long Courſe, and been reaſonably Proſperous and Flouriſhing, under, not only Ignorant, but very Wicked Princes and Magiſtrates, by the mere Force of the Unity, and Compliance, and ready Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Subjects.

Nay, (ſaid he) I impute it not to their Princes Commanding well, but to the Subjects Obeying well.</q> But when the People break their Yoak, or throw it off, and refuſe Obedience, there is no Remedy but ſuch a State muſt be ruin'd, and fall to the Ground.</p>

For this is the Conſequence, if the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are unſucceſsful, and unſuitable in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; That there is no Remedy, but a Man muſt ſtand by his Bargain, be it never ſo bad, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wretched without any other poſſible Cure but Death. Now what can be more contrary to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juſtice, than that the Folly of one half Hour ſhould poyſon the whole Term of all his Years to come? That a Miſtake in one's Choice, or perhaps a Trick, by which he was Trapann'd into this Condition, but, to be ſure, an act of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience many times to the Commands of a Parent, or Complyance with the Advice of a Friend; a ſubmitting one's Own Judgment and Inclination to the Pleaſure and Diſpoſal of Others: What Reaſon (ſay They) is there that any of theſe Things ſhou'd engage a Man to perpetual Miſery and Torment? Were not the other Nooſe about the Neck the wiſer Choice of the Two? and to end one's Days and Troubles immediately by leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing headlong from ſome Rock into the Sea, than thus to launch out into an Eternity of Pains; to have a Hell upon Earth; and always live and lie by a Storm of Jealouſie and Ill-nature, of Rage and Madneſs, of Obſtinacy, and Affectation, and intractable Perverſeneſs, and other vile Qualities in which the Sex abounds? Hence it was the Saying of one Author, <q>That whoever firſt invented the Marriage-Knot, had contrived a very fair and colourable, but withal, a moſt effectual Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53648:240"/>for taking a ſevere Revenge upon Mankind: A Snare or Net to catch Fools and Brutes in, and then put them to a long and lingring Death.</q> And of another, <q>That for a Wiſe Man to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Fool, or a Woman of Senſe a Coxcomb, was like tying the Living to the Dead; that ſo by the Extremity of Cold from the Carkaſs, the Body might chill and languiſh, till at laſt it expire; which is of all Capital Puniſhments the moſt barbarous, that ever Tyrants have been able to invent.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second Accuſation imports, That <hi>Marriage</hi> corrupts and adulterates Generous and Great Minds, by ſoftening and abating, nay utterly enfeebling and diſſolving their Life and Vigour, by the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Dalliances, and Flatterings, and Wheedles of a Perſon, of whom one is fond; by Tenderneſs for one's Children, Care and Management of Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Affairs, and Sollicitude to provide for, and raiſe one's Family in the World. What lamentable Inſtances of this Effeminacy are <hi>Samſon,</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony?</hi> whoſe Falls ſtand in Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, like ſo many noble Ruines, to put us in mind of that Enemy, with ſome Indignation, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermin'd and demoliſh'd what Nature had made ſo ſtrong. If then there muſt be Marrying, it is fit (ſay they) that This ſhould be left to Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that have more Body than Soul; let Them go on ſecurely, being ſo well qualiſy'd, and having ſo little to hazard; and the Cares and Burden of the World are indeed propereſt for Them; for ſuch mean and low Conſiderations are Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments juſt of a Size with Their Capacities. But as for Thoſe, whom Nature hath been ſo liberal to in another kind, and given them good Senſe, and noble Souls, capable of greater and better Things, Is it not pity to ſhackle and bind Them down to the World and the Fleſh, as you do
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53648:240"/>Beaſts to the Manger? Nay, even among Beaſts, ſome Diſtinctions are made too; for Thoſe among them that are moſt eſteem'd for Service and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, (as among Dogs and Horſes particularly) are kept up at a diſtance, and forbidden all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the other Sex; Others of leſs Value ſerving to breed upon very well. Accordingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind, Thoſe that are Devoted to the moſt Venerable and Holy Profeſſions, the Service of the Altar, and a Recluſe Life, both Men and Women; ſuch whoſe Stations oblige them to be the moſt excellent part of the World, the Flower and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Chriſtian Religion, Clergy and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks are forbidden by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever to Marry at all. And the Reaſon moſt certainly is This, that <hi>Marriage</hi> obſtructs Wiſdom and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, calls off the Mind, and gives it too ſtrong and too frequent a Diverſion, clips its Wings, and checks its nobleſt Flights. For the Contemplation of High, and Heavenly, and Divine Objects, is by no means conſiſtent with the Clutter, and Hurry, and ſordid Cares of Family-concerns: Upon which Account it is that the Apoſtle, who commands <hi>Continency</hi> even in <hi>Marriage,</hi> hath preferr'd abſolute <hi>Celibacy</hi> before it. <hi>Marriage</hi> perhaps may have the Advantage in Point of Proſit and Convenience, but the Honour and the Virtue (they tell you) is confeſſedly on the other ſide.</p>

                        <p>Once more; <hi>Marriage</hi> is a great Hindrance to Men's Improvement; particularly it keeps them at home, and cuts them off from the Opportunities of Travelling, and converſing with Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: Which is really a great Accompliſhment, and a mighty Convenience, to learn Wiſdom one's ſelf, and to teach it to others, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what we have ſeen and known, to thoſe who want the ſame Opportunities. In ſhort; <hi>Marriage</hi> does not only cramp up, and depreſs great Parts, and great Souls, but it deprives the World of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble Deſigns, Works of Muniſicence, and Charity, and Publick Good; it renders a Man incapable of ſerving his Country, and attempting ſuch Things, as He can give no entertainment to the Thoughts of, in the Embraces of a tender Wife, and his Little ones round about him. For Theſe need and require the Care and Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Himſelf; and ſerve for an Excuſe, at leaſt they cool his Courage, to Actions that are Brave, if at the ſame time they ſeem Deſperate, or are manifeſtly Dangerous. And is it not a noble Sight now, to ſee a Man that is ſit to be at the Helm, triſſing away his Time at home, playing and telling Stories with his Wife and Children in the Chimney-Corner? Is it not Ten Thouſand Pities, that One who is capable of Governing and Directing a World, ſhould be entirely bury'd in Secreſie, loſt to the Publick, and taken up with the Concerns of a ſingle Family? Upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration it was, that a Great Man, when his Friends moved a Match to him, made anſwer, <hi>That he was born to Command Men, and not one

Our very Remedies muſt make us a little ſick, even when they are promoting our Health and Recovery; and every Convenience carries its Abatement, and is clogg'd and incumbred with ſome Inconvenience inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from it. Theſe are <hi>Evils,</hi> allow it, but they are <hi>Neceſſary Evils.</hi> And if the Caſe be not well in all Points, yet this is the beſt of it; for there is no other way poſſible to be deviſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and propagating Mankind, but what would make the Matter infinitely worſe, and be liable to More and Greater Evils. Some indeed, (as <hi>Plato</hi> in particular) would fain have rooted out theſe Thorns, and reſin'd upon the Point, by inventing other Methods for the Continuance of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but after all their Hammering and Poliſhing, Thoſe Conceits at laſt prov'd mere Caſtles in the Air; Things perfectly impracticable, and ſuch as if once receiv'd could never have laſted; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it appear'd evidently, that tho' they had been practis'd and approv'd, yet even Theſe were loaded too with a great many Inconveniences, and ſore Difficulties. The Truth is, Men create their Own Uneaſineſs, and make all the Hardſhip to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Their Vices and Intemperances, the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and the Contrariety of their Paſſions, are their Tormentors; and then they blame the State
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53648:242"/>in which they feel and ſuffer thoſe Torments. But That is clear, and free from Guilt, and ſo is every Thing but <hi>Man</hi> himſelf, who turns every Thing againſt Himſelf, and knows not how to uſe any Condition as he ought, and to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But Thoſe that are Philoſophers indeed, will go a great deal farther; They will tell you, Theſe very Difficulties recommend <hi>Marriage</hi> the more, as rendring it a School of Virtue, an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip to learn it, a daily and Domeſtick Exerciſe to perfect and render it familiar to us. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> that great Oracle of Wiſdom, when People reproached him with the peeviſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Humour of his Wife, declar'd that it was an Advantage to him; for by that means he learnt at home to behave himſelf with Conſtancy and Patience in all Accidents and Companies abroad; and to make all the Uneaſineſſes of Fortune go down very glibly. But This, tho' it want not a great deal of good Senſe at the Bottom, and may be very uſeful to Men of good Diſpoſitions, and Capacity enough to ſerve themſelves of it, is yet ſuch an Argument as I do not expect many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts from. Admitting then, that They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſingle do beſt conſult their Own private Eaſe and Satisfaction: Admit it better and more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thus to reſerve one's ſelf for Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and eminent Degrees of Virtue, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all thoſe Avocations and Interruptions, which the Cares of a Married Life unavoidably expoſe us to. (And it is in this Senſe, and for theſe Purpoſes only, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> prefers a State of <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy,</hi> which thoſe that make uſe of, and pretend to be directed by his Authority, would do well to conſider) Yet after all, with what Face can any Chriſtian ſpeak in diſparagement of <hi>Marriage,</hi> who remembers at all, what the <hi>Faith</hi> he makes profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, hath taught him to believe in Honour of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53648:242"/>it? For, when all is done, theſe are unanſwerable, and they ought to be eſteem'd very Sacred Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as ſhould command our higheſt Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Reſpect, That it is of God's own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, That it was his firſt Ordinance, That he appointed it in Paradiſe, in a State of Innocence and Perfection, when Humane Nature was in all its Glory. Theſe are Four weighty Conſiderations, and ought to recommend, at leaſt to deliver it from diminiſhing Reflections, when they are not capable of a ſober Reply. After this we find, that the Son of God himſelf was pleas'd to Honour and Approve it with his Preſence, to work his firſt Miracle in favour of it, and the Perſons engag'd in it; nay, that he hath condeſcended to make uſe of This, as a Figure of that moſt Sacred and Inviolable Union betwixt Him and his Church; and upon that Account,<note place="margin">Epheſ. v.</note> given it the Privilege of being ſtyled a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> a <hi>Great and Divine Myſtery.</hi>

Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Conſiderations are neceſſary in order to it, more than reſpect merely the Perſons of thoſe to be concern'd in it. For tho' it be commonly ſaid, <hi>Men Marry for Themſelves alone,</hi> yet there ought to be great regard had to Poſterity; the Family we go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the Alliances we make, the Circumſtances and Condition of the People, are of great weight. And Theſe and other Reſpects muſt be carefully atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to: But above all, the Temper and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which ought to be the principal Objects and Motives of our Affection. The want of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this manner, is the very Reaſon why we ſee ſo few happy Matches. And the extreme Scarcity of ſuch, is a ſign that <hi>Marriage</hi> is highly valuable: For it is a Fate common to all great Poſts, that they are difficult, and very ſeldom diſcharged as they ought to be. Kingly Power and Government is beſet with Cares and Difficulties, and very few that aſpire to it, are ſtrictly Virtuous and Succeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Adminiſtration. But the true Ground of Failing ſo frequently in this Point, is to be fetch'd from the Licentiouſneſs and Debauchery, the Unruly Paſſions and Exorbitant Humours of Mankind, and not from any thing in the State and Inſtitution it ſelf. From hence it is, that we ſind experimentally, Such as are of good, and quiet, and virtuous Diſpoſitions, plain and mean Perſons taſte more of the Comforts, and enjoy themſelves more in it, than others of higher Quality and Attainments. Senſual Deſires, and the Delights of the World have taken leſs hold of ſuch; they are leſs Nice and Curious, and have not ſo much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to teaze and torment Themſelves.

                           <hi>Marriage</hi> is a Wiſe and Prudent Bargain, a Holy and Inviolable League, an Honourable Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">A general Deſcription of it.</note> If this Knot be well ty'd, there is not in the whole World any thing more beautiful, more lovely, more deſirable: It is a ſweet and noble So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, full of Conſtancy and mutual Truſt; full of infinite good Offices and reciprocal Obligations; moſt excellent in their own Nature, moſt uſeful to the Parties Themſelves, and of general Service and Benefit to Mankind. This is a Converſation, Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous not of Love and Senſual Delight, but of chaſte Affection and entire Friendſhip. For <hi>Love</hi> in theſe Two Senſes is a very different Thing, and the One as diſtant from the Other, as the feveriſh and diſeaſed Heat of a ſick Man is from the natural Warmth of a good Temper and healthful Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>Marriage</hi> challenges to it ſelf Affection and Advantage, Juſtice and Honour, Conſtancy and Pleaſure.

What the World calls <hi>Love,</hi> aims at nothing but Delight; it hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomewhat of Sprightlineſs, and is of a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more poignant Reliſh; but this cannot hold long; and we plainly ſee it cannot, by ſo few Matches ſucceeding well, where Beauty and Amorous Deſires were at the bottom of them: There muſt be ſomething more ſolid to make us happy.

This in ſome Places is carried a great deal farther, and extends to Life and Death too; inſomuch, that aſſoon as the Husband is dead, the Wife is obliged to follow him without delay. There are ſome Countries, where the Publick and National Laws require them to do ſo; and they are oftentimes ſo Zealous in their Obedience, that where Polygamy is indulged, if a Man leave ſeveral Wives behind him, they Try for it Publickly, and enter up their Claims, which of them ſhall obtain the Honour and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of ſleeping with their Spouſe (that is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they ſoften it by) and upon this Occaſion, each urges in her own behalf, that ſhe was the beſt belov'd Wife, or had the laſt Kiſs of him, or

In Some Countries there is a greater Latitude, and more Liberties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, in Others leſs. The Chriſtian Religion, which is by much the ſtricteſt of any, hath made it very cloſe and ſtrait. It leaves Nothing at large and in our own Choice, but the firſt Entrance into this Engagement. When once That is over, a Man's Will is made over too, and conveyed away; for the Covenant is ſubject to no Diſſolution, and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53648:246"/>we muſt abide by it, whether we are contented with our Terms, or not. Other Nations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, have contrived to make it more Eaſie, and Free, and Fruitful,<note place="margin">Of Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</note> by allowing and practiſing <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy</hi> and <hi>Divorce;</hi> a Liberty of taking Wives and diſmiſſing them again; and they ſpeak hardly of Chriſtianity for abridging Men in theſe Two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as if it did great Prejudice to Affection and Multiplication by theſe Reſtraints, which are the Two great Ends of Marriage: For Friendſhip, they pretend, is an Enemy to all manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion and Neceſſity; and cannot conſiſt with it; but is much more improved, and better maintain'd, by leaving Men free, and at large to diſpoſe of Themſelves. And Multiplication is promoted by the Female Sex, as Nature ſhews us abundantly in that one Inſtance of Wolves, who are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Fruitful in the Production of their Whelps, even to the Number of Twelve, or Thirteen at a Time; and in this exceed other Animals of Service and common Uſe very much, ſo many of which are kill'd every Day; and ſo few Wolves; And yet there are notwithſtanding fewer of the Breed, Breeders, becauſe fewer She-Wolves, than of any other Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For, as I ſaid, the true Reaſon is, becauſe in all thoſe Numerous Litters, there is commonly but one Bitch-Wolf, which for the moſt Part ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies little, and bears very rarely; the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being hindred by the vaſt Numbers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Mixtures of the Males; and ſo, the much greater part of them die, without ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating their Kind at all, for want of a ſufficient Proportion of Females, to do it by ſucceſsfully. It is alſo manifeſt, what Advantages of this Nature <hi>Polygamy</hi> produces, by the vaſt Increaſe of thoſe Countries where it is allowed; The <hi>Jews, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and other Barbarous Nations, (as all their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories inform us) very uſually bringing Armies into
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53648:247"/>the Field, of Three or Four Hundred Thouſand fighting Men. Now the Chriſtian Religion, on the contrary, allows but One to One, and obliges the Parties to continue thus together; though Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nay ſometimes Both, of them be Barren; which yet perhaps, if allowed to change, might leave a numerous Poſterity behind them. But, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the very beſt of the Caſe, all their Increaſe muſt depend upon the Production of One ſingle Woman. And laſtly, they reflect upon Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the occaſion of inſinite Exceſſes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and Adulteries, by this too ſevere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
                        <p>But the true and ſufficient Anſwer to all theſe Objections is, That the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> does not conſider Marriage upon ſuch Reſpects as are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Humane, and tend to the Gratification of Natural Appetites, or promote the Temporal Good of Men: It takes quite another Proſpect of the Thing, and hath Reaſons peculiar to it ſelf, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and noble, and inſinitely greater, (as hath been hinted already.) Beſides, common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence demonſtrates, that in much the greateſt part of Marry'd Perſons, what they complain of as Confinement and Conſtraint, does by no means cool and deſtroy, but promote and heighten the Affection, and render it more dear and ſtrong, by keeping it more entire and unbroken. Eſpecially in Men of honeſt Principles, and good Diſpoſitions, which eaſily accommodate their Humours, and make it their Care and Study to comply with the Tempers of the Perſon to whom they are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably united. And as for the Debaucheries and Flyings out alledg'd againſt us, the only Cauſe of Them is the Diſſoluteneſs of Men's Manners; which a greater Liberty, though never ſo great, will never be able to correct, or put a Stop to. And accordingly we find, that Adulteries were every
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53648:247"/>whit as rife in the midſt of Polygamy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce; Witneſs the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general, and the Example of <hi>David</hi> in particular, who became guilty of this Crime, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Multitude he had of <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Concubines</hi> of his own. On the contrary, Theſe Vices were not known for a long while together in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where neither Polygamy nor Divorce were ever permitted; as in <hi>Sparta,</hi> for Inſtance, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> for a conſiderable time after the Founding of that City. It is therefore moſt fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, to aſperſe <hi>Religion,</hi> and charge That with the Vices of Men, which allows and teaches nothing, but exquiſite Purity and ſtrict Continence.</p>

In Some Places, All that are Wives to the ſame Man, live alike, and in common. Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Quality, the Reſpect and Authority is equal, and ſo is the Condition and Title of their Children too. In Other Places there is one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Wife, who is the Principal, and a ſort of Miſtreſs above the reſt; the Right of Inheritance is limited to the Children by Her; They engroſs all the Honours, and Poſſeſſions, and Pre-eminences of the Husband after his Death: As for the Others, they are lodg'd and maintain'd apart, treated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differently from the former: In ſome Places they are reputed <hi>Lawful Wives;</hi> in ſome they are only ſtiled <hi>Concubines;</hi> and their Children have no Pretenſion to Titles or Eſtates; but are provided for by ſuch annual Penſions, or other precarious ways of Subſiſting, as the Maſter of the Family thinks fit to allow them.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> As various have the Practice and the Cuſtoms of Men been with regard to <hi>Divorce:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Divorce differently practiſed.</note> For with ſome, as particularly the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> they never oblige Themſelves to alledge the particular Cauſe of Separation; nor are they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to take a Wife to them a Second time, which they have once divorc'd; So far from it, that they are permitted to Marry again to others. But now in the <hi>Mahometan Law,</hi> Separation muſt be appointed by a Judge, and after Legal Proceſs, (except it be done by the free Conſent of both Parties) and the Crimes alledg'd againſt the Woman muſt be ſome of ſo high a Nature, as ſtrike directly at the Root of this Inſtitution, and are deſtructive and inconſiſtent with the State of Marriage, or ſome of the principal Ends of it; ſuch as <hi>Adultery, Barrenneſs, Incongruity of Humours, Attempts upon the Life of the other Party;</hi> and, after ſuch Separation made, it is lawful for them to be reconcil'd, and cohabit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as oft as they think ſit. The Former of theſe Methods ſeems much more prudent and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that ſo there may be a cloſer Reſtraint both upon the Pride and Inſolence of Wives, when they lie at Mercy, and may be caſt off at Pleaſure; and alſo upon the Humourſome and Peeviſh Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who will be more apt to check and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Reſentments, when there is no Return, nothing to be got by repenting, after once Matters have flown ſo high, as to provoke and effect a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Second, which proceeds in a Method of Juſtice, brings the Parties upon the Publick Stage, expoſes their Faults and Follies to the World, cuts them out from Second Marriages; and diſcovers a great many things, which were much better kept conceal'd. And, in caſe the Allegation be not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd; and ſo they continue oblig'd to cohabit ſtill, after all this mutual Complaining and Diſgrace, What a Temptation is here to Poyſoning or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53648:248"/>to get rid that way of a Partner of the Bed, which in Courſe of Law cannot be remov'd? And many of theſe Villanies, no doubt, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, of which the World never had the leaſt Knowledge or Suſpicion. As at <hi>Rome</hi> particularly, before Divorce came in uſe, a Woman who was apprehended for Poyſoning her Husband, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Wives, whom ſhe knew to have been guilty of the ſame Fact; and They again others, till at laſt Threeſcore and Ten were all Attainted and Executed for the ſame Fault, of whom Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not the leaſt Jealouſie, till this Diſcovery was made. But that which ſeems the worſt of all in the Laws relating to a Married Life, is, that <hi>Adultery</hi> is ſcarce any where puniſh'd with <hi>Death;</hi> and all that can be done in that Caſe, is only <hi>Divorce,</hi> and ceaſing to cohabit; Which was an Ordinance introduc'd by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> One whom his Wife had in perfect Subjection: And no wonder if She made uſe of that Dominion, (as ſhe really did) to get ſuch Laws enacted, as made moſt for the Advantage of her own Sex. Now this leaves Men in perpetual danger of <hi>Adultery,</hi> tempts them to malicious Deſires of one another's Death; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender that does the Injury is not made a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Example, and the Innocent Perſon that receives the Wrong, hath no Reparation made for it.</p>

But even this Paternal Authority hath not been at all Times, and in all Parts of the World equal and alike. In ſome Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and indeed of Old almoſt every where, it was univerſal,<note place="margin">Dion. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licar. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. Antiq.</note> and without reſtraint: The Life and Death, Eſtates and Goods, the Liberty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Actions and Behaviour of Children was entirely at Their Will; They ſued and were ſued for them; They diſpoſed of them in Marriage; the Labours of the Children redounded to the Parents Profit; nay, They themſelves were a kind of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity;</hi> for among the <hi>Romans</hi> we ſind this Article,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. in Suiſ. ff. de lib. &amp; poſth.</note> in that which was call'd <hi>Romulus his Law;</hi>

                           <hi>The Right of Parents over Children ſhall be entire and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; they ſhall have Power to abdicate and baniſh, to ſell, and to put them to death.</hi> Only it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That all Children under Three Years old, were excepted out of this Condition, becauſe they
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53648:249"/>could not be capable of offending in Word or Deed,<note place="margin">Aul. Gel. <hi>lib.</hi> 20. Ariſtot. Ethic. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. Caeſar, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. de Bell. Gall. Proſper Aquit. in Epiſt. Sigiſm.</note> nor to give any juſt Provocation for ſuch hard Uſage. This Law was afterwards confirm'd and renew'd, by the Law of the <hi>Twelve Tables;</hi> which allow'd Parents to ſell their Children Three times: And the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Gauls,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> agree; the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> might do it Four times. There want not ſome probable Reaſons to perſuade us, that this Power had ſome Foundation, or Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at leaſt, in the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> undertaking to ſlay his Son, hath been made uſe of, as an Argument to this purpoſe: For had This been a Thing againſt his <hi>Duty,</hi> and ſuch as the <hi>Authority</hi> of a Father could in no caſe extend to, he would not (they tell you) ever have conſented to it; nor have believed, that this Command had proceeded from God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have imputed it to ſome Deluſion upon his own Mind, if it had been no way reconcilable with Nature, the Laws of which, God had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Beginning, and could not be thought ſo to contradict Himſelf, as by any particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to appoint a thing altogether inconſiſtent with his own General Inſtitution before. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is obſervable, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> never went about to make any Reſiſtance, nor pleaded his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in Bar to what his Father went about to do; as knowing that he only exerted the rightful Power he had over him. What Force there is in this Argument, I ſhall not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. It is ſufficient for my preſent Purpoſe to obſerve, That allowing all this, yet it does not in any degree take off from the Commendation due to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith; for he does not pretend to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> his Son by Vertue of any ſuch <hi>Inherent Right</hi> over him, nor upon any Provocation, or Miſdemeanour, which <hi>Iſaac</hi> had given him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:53648:250"/>to reſent or puniſh; but purely in obedience to the Command of Almighty God. The Caſe does not ſeem to differ much under the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> allowing only for ſome Circumſtances, as to the manner of exerciſing this Authority, which will be taken notice of by and by. Of This, and no leſs Extent the <hi>Paternal Power</hi> ſeems to have been formerly in the greateſt part of the World, and ſo to have continu'd till the Time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. Among the <hi>Greeks</hi> indeed, and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Diodor.</note> it does not ſeem to have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo abſolute; but even There, if a Father hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to kill his Son unjuſtly, and without Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Puniſhment inflicted for ſuch Barbarity was no other than being ſhut up with the Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for Three Days together.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now the Reaſons, <note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it.</note> and the Effects of ſo great and unlimited a Power being allow'd to Fathers over their Children, (which no doubt was a great advantage for the Advancement of Virtue, the Improvement of Manners and Education, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, preventing, and chaſtiſing Extravagance and Vice, and of great good Conſequence to the Publick too) ſeem to have been ſuch as Theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The containing Children in their Duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and preſerving a due Awe and Reverence in their Minds. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Then a Regard to ſeveral Vices and Enormities, which, though very grievous in Themſelves, would yet paſs unpuniſh'd, to the great Prejudice of the Publick, if they could be taken cognizance of, and animadverted upon by no other Ways and Perſons, but Legal Proceſs, and the Sentence of the Magiſtrate; For abundance of Theſe muſt needs eſcape ſuch Cenſure, partly becauſe they would be Domeſtick and Private, and partly becauſe there would be no body to inform and proſecute. The Parents Themſelves were not
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53648:250"/>likely to be ſo Officious; the Nearneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation would render it odious, and the Intereſt of their own Family would reſtrain them from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their own Shame. Or, if they could be ſuppos'd to bring all they knew of this kind upon the Open Stage, yet we know there are many Vices, and Inſolencies, and Diſorders, which the Laws and Juſtice of Nations are not provided with Puniſhments for. To all which we may add, that there are many Family-Quarrels, between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Children, Brothers and Siſters, upon the account of dividing Eſtates and Goods, or ſeveral other Things, which, tho' ſit to be canvaſs'd and corrected within a Man's own Walls, would by no means do well to be ript up, and expoſed to the World; and for Theſe, as the <hi>Paternal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is neceſſary, ſo it is ſufficient to compoſe and quiet all Parties, and put an End to Differences, that concern ſingle Families only. And it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for the Law to ſuppoſe, that no Father would make ill uſe of this Power; that Men might very ſafely be entruſted with it, becauſe of that very tender Affection, which Nature inſpires all Parents with, ſuch as ſeems altogether inconſiſtent with Cruelty toward their own Off-ſpring: And this we ſee the effect of Daily, in the frequent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions made by Fathers, for the Releaſing or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating thoſe publick Puniſhments, which they cannot but be ſenſible are moſt juſtly inflicted; there being no greater Torment to any Parent, than to ſee his Children under Pain or Diſgrace. And where Theſe abſolute Prerogatives were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, we meet with very few Inſtances of the exerting their Power, and going to the Extremity of it, without Offences very heinous indeed; ſo that, in truth, if we regard the Practice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare That with the Power it ſelf, we ſhall have reaſon to look upon it as a uſeful Terrour, a
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53648:251"/>Bugbear to keep Children in Awe, and fright them into Obedience, rather than any Stretch of Rigour, that was actual, and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now this Paternal Authority was gradually loſt, and fell to the Ground as it were of it ſelf,<note place="margin">Its Decay.</note> (for the Decay of it is in truth to be attributed to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, more than to any Law expreſly Repealing it, or Enacting the contrary) and it began moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably to decline, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours came to the Government: For from the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or quickly after, it ſunk apace, and loſt all its Vigour. And upon this Decay Children grew ſo ſtubborn and inſolent againſt their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Addreſs to <hi>Nero,</hi>

Till then, if a Father at any time <hi>killed</hi> his Children, he was called to no Account, nor had any Puniſhment inflicted upon him for the Fact; as we may gather evidently by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Febvins</hi> the Senator,<note place="margin">Saluſt. in Bell. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talin. Valer.

Cod. de pa. poteſt.</note> and deliver them over to publick Juſtice: And the Judge in ſuch Caſes was oblig'd to pronounce Sentence as the Father ſhould direct; in which there are ſome Footſteeps of Antiquity. And theſe Laws, in abridging the Power of the Fathers, proceeded very tenderly,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53648:251"/>and did not take it away entirely and openly, but with great Moderation, and by halves only. Theſe later Ordinances have ſome Affinity to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Deut. xxi.</note> which ordered the ſtubborn and Rebellious Son to be ſtoned, upon the Complaint of the Parents, without requiring any farther Proof of the Charge than their ſingle Depoſition; and provided the Preſence and Concurrence of the Magiſtrate, not ſo much for Examination and Tryal of the Cauſe, as to prevent the Privacy and Paſſion, which might attend Domeſtick Puniſhments, and ſo to render the thing more publick, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance more exemplary, and full of Terrour to others. And thus, even according to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitution, the <hi>Paternal Authority</hi> was more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and extenſive, than it came to be ſince the Time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. But if we deſcend a little Lower, and obſerve its Decreaſe under <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> then under <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and at laſt under <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> we ſhall find it almoſt totally extinct. Hence it came to paſs, that Children took upon them to decline, and peremptorily deny O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Parents; to refuſe them a Part in their Poſſeſſions; nay, not to allow them ſo much as convenient Maintenance and Relief in their Neceſſities. Hence they had conſidence to enter Actions againſt them, and implead them in Courts of Judicature; and an indecent, a moſt ſcandalous Thing in truth it is, to obſerve how frequent ſuch Suits have been. Some have been ſo wicked, or ſo miſtaken, as to excuſe Themſelves from <hi>Duty</hi> upon pretence of <hi>Religion;</hi> and dedicate That to God, which their Parents had a Right to; as we find Our Bleſſed Saviour reproaches the <hi>Jews</hi> for doing;<note place="margin">Matt. xv.</note> and the manner he mentions it in, ſhews plainly, that this impious kind of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a Practice cuſtomary among them before his Time.

But ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to diſannul and deſtroy it, is by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Decency or Virtue, and leaſt of all to the Advantage of the Publick. For when once the Reins are let looſe, and Countenance is given to Diſobedience in private Families, it quickly grows to a general Spirit of Faction, and Diſorder, and Ungovernable Inſolence; and the caſting off the Yoke of the Natural Parents, is a bold and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Step toward Rebellion againſt the Civil. The Effect whereof hath been abundantly ſeen in the many Inconveniences, which Governments have ſuffer'd upon the Relaxation or utter Reſcinding of this Authority; whereby in the Event they only

Since Brutes have nothing of this Kind among Them; nor do They either compel their Fellows by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Fraud, or voluntarily ſubmit themſelves to Captivity. This ſeems rather then to have been diſpens'd with, than approv'd by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> But even this Indulgence, accommodated to the Neceſſities of that People, and the Hardneſs of their Hearts, was not ſo rigorous as the Practice of other Places; for neither was the Power ſo abſolute, nor the Slavery perpetual; but the One confin'd to Rules, and the Other terminated with the Seventh or Sabbatical Year. Chriſtianity find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Uſage Univerſal, did not ſee fit to break in upon this Conſtitution, but left its Proſelytes at liberty in this Particular, as it did in a Permiſſion
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:53648:253"/>of ſerving and dwelling under Heathen and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Princes and Maſters. For This and many other Things could not be aboliſh'd and ſet aſide at once; but by giving ſome little Diſcountenance to them, Time hath worn them off gently, and by degrees.</p>

                           <hi>Slaves</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed into Four ſeveral Kinds. <note place="margin">Several ſorts of Slavery.</note> 1.

Such as are <hi>Slaves upon Force,</hi> made ſo by Conqueſt, and the Rights of War. 3. <hi>Adjudged Slaves,</hi> ſuch as are made and awarded to be ſuch, either by way of Puniſhment for ſome Crime, or for the Satisfaction of ſome Debt, which gives the Creditors a Right to their Perſons, and of employing them to their own Benefit and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This Slavery was limited among the <hi>Jews</hi> only to a certain Seaſon, Seven Years at the moſt; the <hi>Sabbatical</hi> Year put an End to it all; but in other Countries it continu'd till the Debt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. 4. <hi>Voluntary Slaves,</hi> or ſuch as are of their own making, as Thoſe who throw Dice for it, or who ſell their Liberty for a Summ of Money, as it hath been the Cuſtom to do in <hi>Germany;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Tacit. de mor.

This laſt ſort of voluntary and choſen Captivity is, I confeſs, to Me, the moſt aſToniſhing of all the reſt; and tho' all manner of <hi>Slavery</hi> ſeems to be an Incroachment and Violence upon Nature, yet ſure no Kind of it can be ſo unnatural, as that which a Man covets, and brings upon Himſelf.

And this prov'd a very great Invitation, and powerful Inducement, to convert and win Men over.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Want and extreme Neceſſity preſently began to pinch theſe kind of People, <note place="margin">Return to Servitude.</note> and compelled them to return back again to Servitude in their own Defence.

Beſides this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Occaſion, and the Servitude choſen upon it, the World hath pretty much relapſed into the Uſing

Upon the ſame Account it is, that the Perſons in that Dignity and Elevation, are eſteem'd and reverenc'd much above the Rate of Common Men. And very Juſt it is they ſhould be ſo, for this Opinion is of great Uſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort that Reſpect and Obedience from the People, upon the due Payment whereof, all the Peace and Quiet of Societies depend. But if we take theſe great Perſons apart from their Publick Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and conſider them as Men, we ſhall find them juſt of the ſame Size, and caſt in the ſame Mould, with other common Men; nay, too often, of worſe Diſpoſitions, and not ſo liberally dealt with by Nature, as many of their Inferiours. We are apt to think that every Thing a <hi>Prince</hi> does, muſt
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:53648:257"/>needs proceed upon great and weighty Reaſons, becauſe all they do is in the Event of great and general Importance to Mankind; but in truth the Matter is much otherwiſe, and They think, and reſolve, and act, juſt like One of Us; For Nature hath given Them the ſame Faculties, and moves them by the ſame Springs. The Provocation, which would ſet Two private Neighbours to Scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Quarrelling, makes a Publick War between Two States; and what One of Us would whip his Child or his Page for, incenſes a Monarch to chaſtiſe a Province, that hath offended him.

For in truth their Condition, in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is inſinitely Worſe than that of Private Men. The Luſtre and Eminence of great Perſons gives them great Inconvenience in the Fruition, of what it furniſhes them with Power and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for.

                           <note place="margin">In their Marriage.</note> The Matches made by Perſons of inferiour Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are infinitely more free and eaſie; the effect of Choice, the reſult of Affection, more void of Conſtraint, and full of Satisfaction. One great Reaſon, no doubt, of this Difference is, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Men have greater Choice, and may find great Variety and Numbers equal with Themſelves, to take a Wife out of; But Kings and Princes are but few; and therefore if They reſolve to marry ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Themſelves, there can be no great picking
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53648:260"/>and chooſing in the Caſe. But the other Reaſon is, and indeed the more conſiderable of the Two, That Private Perſons have nothing farther to aim at beyond their own particular Concerns; They conſult their own Comfort and Convenience; but Princes are often confin'd and ty'd up by publick Conſiderations. Their Marriages are vaſt Intrigues of State, and deſign'd to be inſtrumental in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Happineſs and Peace of the World in general. Great Perſons do not Marry for Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for the common Good of Nations and Kingdoms. And this is what they ought to be more in love with, and tender of, than of their Wife and Children. Upon this Account they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliged to hearken to Propoſals where there is neither Affection nor Delight to invite them; they often engage themſelves to Perſons, whom they are ſo far from being taken with, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they never know nor ſee them, till it is out of their Power to retreat. There is no ſuch thing as <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Liking</hi> between the Parties; but the ſhort of the Matter is, Such a great <hi>Prince</hi> marries ſuch a great <hi>Princeſs,</hi> which, if he had been in another Capacity, he would never have choſen or conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. But the Publick was concern'd, and is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it; and he is content to enſlave Himſelf for his whole Life, becauſe that Alliance was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be contracted, for the ſtrengthening his Intereſt, and the ſecurity of his Kingdoms; and the mutual Benefit and Eaſe which Nations may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſuch a convenient Union.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> I may reckon this for a Fourth Diſadvantage, that They can have no part in thoſe Tryals and little Emulations, which other Men are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in towards one another, by the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie they expreſs of their Honour, or ſignalizing their Valour, their Wit, or their Bodily Strength; which after all, is one of the moſt ſenſible Pleaſures Men
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:53648:260"/>enjoy in Converſation with one another. The Reaſon is obvious; becauſe every Man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound in good Manners to yield to Them, to ſave a Decency, and not ſuffer them to be outdone; and had rather balk their Own Honour, and abate of what they could do upon theſe Occaſions, than give Offence to a Prince, whom they know Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of being thought the Conqueror of all that contend with him. Now the Bottom and Truth of all this Matter is, that upon pretence of Deference and Reſpect, ſuch Great Men are abus'd, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Scorn, and ſecret Contempt; which gave occaſion to a wiſe Man to ſay, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Princes were in a very ill way of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they learnt nothing as they ſhould do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Art of Riding a Manag'd Horſe; becauſe in all other Caſes Men yield, and adjudge the Prize to them; but this Beaſt, who is not capable of Flattery, nor hath learnt the Arts of Courtſhip and Complaiſance, makes no difference between the Prince and his Groom, and throws either of them without diſtinction. Several great Men have therefore refuſed the Applauſes of Spectators, and ſcorn'd their formal Commendations, ſaying, <hi>I ſhould take this kindly, and be proud of it, if it came from Perſons that durſt ſay otherwiſe, and who would take that generous Freedom of finding Fault with Me, when I gave them a juſt occaſion of doing ſo.</hi>

Now the Elevation of a Prince is ſo high, and the Diſtance at which his Subjects ſtand below him ſo very great, that it makes any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and free Correſpondence impracticable. All the Services, and Compliments, and humble For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities paid them, come from ſuch Hands as muſt do what they do, and dare not do otherwiſe. They are by no means the effect of Friendſhip, but of ſervile Submiſſion, and Intereſt, and Deſign. All their zealous Profeſſions are not for His ſake, but their Own; to ingratiate and to raiſe Themſelves; or elſe they are a Matter of Cuſtom and Shew only.

They are never ſuffer'd to know All; nor are they ever throughly acquainted what condition their Affairs are really in; ſome better Face put upon the good part, and ſome part conceal'd or colour'd over, which is unfortunate or ill-manag'd, and would be unacceptable, if rightly repreſented.

Sometimes Thoſe Perſons who are in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Poſts, have yet no great Matter of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Power lodg'd in their Hands; as the King's

They draw the Images much bigger and more beautiful than the Life; or elſe ſet us ſuch Patterns of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and Auſtere Virtue, as are impoſſible for us to equal, and ſo diſcourage many; and render the Attempt it ſelf Dangeous, and of ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſome. Theſe are merely the Painter's Fancy, like <hi>Plato</hi>'s Republick, Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s <hi>Utopia, Cicero</hi>'s Orator, or <hi>Horace</hi> his Poet. Noble Characters indeed, and a Collection of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Excellencies in Speculation; but ſuch as the World wants living Inſtances of. The Beſt and moſt perfect Law-giver, who in marvelous Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53648:265"/>was pleaſed himſelf to be ſenſible of our Infirmities, hath ſhewed great Tenderneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for them, and wiſely conſider'd what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature would bear. He hath ſuited all Things ſo well to the Capacities of Mankind, that thoſe Words of His are True, even in this Reſpect alſo, <hi>My Yoke is eaſie, and my Burden is light.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, where theſe Powers are not duly conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the <hi>Laws</hi> are firſt of all Unjuſt; for ſome Proportion ought to be obſerv'd between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Obedience; the Duty impoſed, and the Ability to diſcharge it. I do not ſay, Theſe Commands ſhould not exceed what is uſually done, but what is poſſible to be done; for what Vanity and Folly is it to oblige People to be always in a Fault, and to cut out more Work, than can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be finiſhed? Accordingly we may frequently obſerve, that theſe rigid Stretchers of Laws, are the Firſt that expoſe them to publick Scorn, by their own Neglect; and, like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, lay heavy Burdens upon others, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not ſo much as touch with one of their Fingers. Theſe Examples are but too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all Profeſſions; This is the Way of the World. Men direct one Thing, and practiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and That, not always through Defect or Corruption of Manners, but ſometimes even out of Judgment and Principle too.</p>
                        <p>Another Fault too frequent is, That many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are exceeding Scrupulous and Nice in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are merely Circumſtantial, or free and indifferent in their own Nature; even above what they expreſs themſelves in ſome of the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſubſtantial Branches of their Duty, ſuch as the Laws of God, or the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have bound upon them. This is much ſuch another Extravagance, as lending to other People,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53648:265"/>while we neglect to pay our own Debts. A <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Oſtentation,</hi> which our Heavenly Maſter ſo ſeverely expoſes the Jewiſh Elders for, and is at the Bottom no better than <hi>Hypocriſe;</hi> a mocking of God, and Miſerable deluding of their own Souls.</p>

                           <q>It is of great Uſe, that by comparing the Law with our Practice, and in the Perfection of the One, diſcerning the Defect of the Other; we may be humbled, may be ſenſible of our Impotency, may thence be forced to ſeek the Helps of Grace, and the Benefit of Mercy.</q>

                           <q>Were the Rule never ſo low, our Practice would come below it; it is therefore expedient that it ſhould be high; that at leaſt we may riſe higher in Performance than otherwiſe we ſhould do. For the higher we aim, the nearer we ſhall go to the due Pitch; as He that aimeth at Heaven, although he cannot reach it, will yet ſhoot higher, than He that aimeth only at the Houſe Top.</q>

                           <q>The Height of Duty doth prevent Sloth and Decay in Virtue, keeping us in wholeſom Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and in continual Improvement, while we are always climbing towards the Top, and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto farther Attaintment. The ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of which Courſe, as it will be more Profitable to Us, ſo it will be no leſs Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, than if we could thoroughly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law; For in Judgment God will only reckon upon the Sincerity and Earneſtneſs of our Endeavour; ſo that if we have done our Beſt, it will be taken, as if we had done All. <hi>Our Labour will not be loſt in the Lord;</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of performance will be conſidered, and he that hath done his Duty in part, ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably recompenſed; according to that of St. <hi>Paul, Every Man ſhall receive his own reward according to his own Work.</hi> Hence ſometimes we are enjoyned to be <hi>perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> and to <hi>be Holy as God is Holy;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while to <hi>go on to Perfection,</hi> and <hi>to preſs toward the Mark;</hi> which Precepts, in Effect do import the ſame Thing; but the latter implieth the former, although in Attainment impoſſible, yet in Attempt very profitable.

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53648:267"/>give it entire, for the greater Satisfaction of Them who think themſelves concern'd to conſider it: And likewiſe, that it might be of more Uſe, when apply'd, (as very appliable it is) to other <hi>Laws</hi> and Precepts, wherein <hi>Religion</hi> is not immediately concerned. In ſhort, a <hi>Law-Giver</hi> and a <hi>Judge</hi> are two very different Characters, and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire very different Methods, and Principles; for it is one Thing to Eſtabliſh, and Another to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law.

To all which I add too, that though we none of us can attain to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet moſt of us might go much greater Lengths towards it, than we do. And that This is often made an unneceſſary Pretence, a Cloak to our Folly, or Sloth, or indulged Vices; which, when they have all of them been wilful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, we palliate and excuſe, by taking Sanctuary very improperly, in the Infirmities of Humane Nature, the Imperfections and Failings of the beſt Men, and the Impoſſibility and Impracticableneſs of the Duties impoſed upon us.</p>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion puts them upon deſiring Order; and when they are compoſed, they hate Order and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then, as much as they did Confuſion before.

Some follow a Life of Buſineſs and Company; Others avoid This, and make their Eſcape out of the World, by running into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. Some are fond of Arms and a Camp; Others hate and abhor them: Some have their Subſtance in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; Others have their own diſtinct Properties.

Some are abſolute Courtiers to every Body, and upon all Occaſions; Others regard and make court to nothing but Themſelves. Some prefer the Diverſions of the Town, and Others the Pleaſures of the Country.

                           <hi>CHAP. LIII.</hi> The Three Sorts or Degrees of Life, as it is common to the Generality of Men, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd and compar'd together.</head>
                        <p>IT is eaſie to obſerve Three diſtinct Sorts, and as it were Degrees of Life, common to Men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. One <hi>Private,</hi> in which every Man is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably concern'd; for by this I mean only what paſſes with each Man's Self, within, and in regard to his Own Breaſt. The Second is <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> in one's Own Houſe and Family, with regard to what paſſes at Home, and in our ordinary Courſe of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. The Third is <hi>Publick,</hi> and reſpects what is expoſed to the common View of the World. In the Firſt of theſe there is no manner of Reſtraint;
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53648:272"/>in the Second no Pains or Study to recommend one's Behaviour, as being not accountable for our Own Management to Them that live under our Own Roof and Government; but all the Reſerve, and Artifice, and Diſſimulation is in a manner appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the laſt of Theſe. Now it is much more difficult to be regular and exact in the firſt of theſe Degrees, than in either of the other; and the Examples of Perſons that are, or have been ſo, have been infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely fewer; and ſo in proportion the Caſe ſtands with the Second too, in compariſon of the Third ſort. The Reaſon is obvious and evident. For where there is no body to judge, or controul, or countermand; nay, where there is not ſo much as a Spectator to obſerve our Actions; where we have no apprehenſion of Puniſhment for doing amiſs, no expectation of Reward for doing well, we are much more remiſs and careleſs in our Behaviour. Reaſon and Conſcience are here the only Guides we have to follow; and although Theſe may be ſome Check, yet that is not comparable to the Reſtraints we feel, when placed in open View, and made the common Mark of All, who muſt needs ſee, and will take a Freedom of cenſuring our Actions. Applauſe and Glory, fear of Scandal and Reproach, or ſome other Paſſion of the like Nature, are much more powerful Motives; theſe carry and manage us after a very different manner. (And indeed the greateſt part of Mankind are more govern'd by Paſſions of this Nature, than by any ſtrict Senſe of Duty, and regard to Virtue) Theſe put us upon our Guard, and teach us Prudence upon force. And from the Influence of Theſe it is, that many People have the Reputation of Holy and Excellent Perſons; and behave Themſelves as ſuch in the Eye of the World; who yet in reality, and at the bottom, are mere Hypocrites, ſtark nought, and rotten at the Core, and have not one commendable
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:53648:273"/>Quality belonging to them. What paſſes before Men is all Farce and Counterfeit; we put it on for Convenience, and are concern'd to appear thus to the Spectators; but the Truth of us is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and the Man can have no true Judgment made of him, but from what he does in private and alone. We muſt ſee him in his conſtant and every-day's Dreſs, and ſtrip him of thoſe Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſet him off when he comes abroad: We muſt know his Temper and his uſual Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for all the reſt is Fiction and Conſtraint.<note n="*" place="bottom">Univerſus mundus exercet hiſtrioniam.</note> 
                           <hi>All the World are Actors, and play their Parts to pleaſe the Audience.</hi> And it was well obſerv'd by a Wiſe Man, That none are good, except ſuch as are ſo inwardly, and by Themſelves: And that Virtue is always the ſame; as cautious, as prudent upon the account of Conſcience, as it is in Obedience to the publick Laws and Cuſtoms of the World; as fearful of offending one's own Self, and as careful to avoid the Condemnation of one's own Breaſt, when no Eye ſees us, as it is of the Obſervation and Reproaches of all Mankind. Publick Actions, ſuch as Exploits in War, delivering an Opinion in Senate or Council, diſcharging an Embaſſy, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning a Nation, or the like, are bright and loud; every body ſees, every body hears of them; and therefore Theſe are perform'd with all poſſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Circumſpection; but ſuch Private and Domeſtick ones, as Chiding, Laughing, Selling and Buying, Borrowing and Paying, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with our own Families, and moſt intimate Acquaintance, are ſilent and dark; they make no Noiſe, fear no Diſcovery, and are therefore thought worthy very little, or not any Attention or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at all. Nay, we are ſometimes ſcarce ſo
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:53648:273"/>much as ſenſible of them when we do them. And if in Theſe, Men be ſo unthinking, a little Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſoon convince us, that they are infinitely more ſo, in Thoſe yet more ſecret and merely internal; ſuch as Loving, Hating, Deſiring, of which none is or can be conſcious, but their own Minds.</p>
                        <p>There is one Thing more, fit to be obſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, and a very ſad and wicked Thing it is <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Men, being depraved by a kind of Hypocriſie, natural to them, have taught Themſelves and Others to make a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and be infinitely more Scrupulous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, for their outward Behaviour; (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Shew, and Form, and is perfectly free and at their own Diſpoſal, of no Conſequence in the World, but all over Set-Countenance and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Things of no real Difficulty, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Subſtance and Effect) than they are for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miſcarriages, or private Actions; (ſuch as are buried in Secrecy, and make no Figure, but yet are highly Expedient and Neceſſary, very Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in Themſelves, and therefore very Difficult) For upon theſe Laſt, the Reforming of our Souls, the Moderating of our Paſſions, and the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our whole Life and Converſation depends. And yet the Former are not only preferred before them in our Care and Concern, but the Matter is ſo ordered, that even They who find themſelves well diſpoſed, will by conſtant Study and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to diſcharge thoſe outward Actions punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, degenerate into Formality of courſe, and by inſenſible Degrees grow Cold, and Negligent, in their Regard for the others.</p>
                        <p>Now, of all theſe Sorts, it is plain, that the Men (as Hermits for Inſtance) who live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Solitude, and have but One of theſe Three, That of the Internal and moſt private Life only to
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53648:274"/>take Care of, are upon better Terms, and have an eaſier Task to diſcharge, than Thoſe that have Two; and ſo likewiſe he that hath the Domeſtick Care added to the former, and ſo lies under a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Two Capacities, is expoſed to leſs Difficulty than the Perſons of a Publick Life and Character, upon whom the Care of all the Three Degrees is incumbent.</p>

                        <p>THey that upon all Occaſions recommend and cry up a <hi>Solitary Life,</hi> are ſo far certainly in the Right, that it is an Excellent Means of Eaſe and Quiet; a ſure Retreat from the Hurry and Troubles of the World; a very proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Defence againſt the Vices and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a profligate Age; which are commonly propagated by Infection and Example; and are very likely to Spread and Reign, where much the greater Part of thoſe we converſe with, are already tainted with the Diſeaſe. For not One in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand is Vertuous and Good; the Number of Fools is Infinite, and the thicker the Crowd, the greater the Danger. Thus far, I ſay, they have Reaſon on their Side; for ill Company is certainly one of the moſt fatal and enſnaring Things in the World; and that, not only in Regard of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but of the Puniſhment and Vengeance it expoſes Men to. Accordingly we may obſerve how very careful Men that went to Sea, uſed to be, that no Blaſphemer or profane Perſon ſhould embark in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:53648:274"/>the ſame Veſſels, no profligate, wicked Wretch to endanger their Safety, or render their Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>age Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous or Unſuccesful. One ſingle <hi>Jonas</hi> you ſee, whom God was Angry with, had like to have loſt all the Ship's Crew: And <hi>Bias,</hi> when ſome wicked Wretches call'd upon their Gods in a Storm, made them this ingenious Reproof by way of Raillery, <hi>Hold your Peace, that they may not diſcover ſuch vile Wretches as you are on board. Albuquerque,</hi> who was Viceroy of the Indies under <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when in extreme Danger, laid hold on a young Boy, and clung faſt to him, that ſo his Innocence might be a Shelter and Sanctuary to him, againſt the Wrath of God. So beneficial hath Virtue been eſteemed, and ſo deſtructive Vice, not only to the Guilty, or the Vitious Perſons themſelves, but to all that are concerned with them, or come within the Reach of their Influence.</p>
                        <p>But yet to eſteem a Life thus retired and at a Diſtance from Evil, abſolutely the Beſt, and moſt Excellent; to think it better qualify'd than any other, for the Exerciſe and Perfection of Virtue; to call it more Difficult and Unpleaſant, more La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and Painful than any other, as ſome who extol a voluntary renouncing the World, would fain perſuade us to believe, is a mighty Error in themſelves, or a groſs Cheat upon other People. For, quite contrary, it is the moſt effectual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of throwing off the Cares and troubleſome Incumbrances of Life, and rendring it light and eaſie; and to ſay the very Beſt of it, is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean and moderate Attainment, an imperfect Beginning, or rather a mere Diſpoſition to be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. It is, not to meddle with Buſineſs, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon Difficulties and Troubles; But how is this done? It is not by engaging with, and bravely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming them, but by cowardly running away, declining the Combate, and hiding ones ſelf from
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:53648:275"/>them. It is to play leaſt in Sight, and be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive, for fear we ſhould not live well when we are ſeen. No Doubt is to be made, but a Prince, a Magiſtrate, or Parochial Prieſt, are more perfect, more valuable, when Good in their kind, than Monks and Hermits: For in truth, ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Seminaries were only deſign'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Men for Dignities and Buſineſs; to qualifie them for Society and the World. And Colleges and Cloiſters do not give, but only lead Men to Uſefulneſs and Perfection. He that maintains his Poſt in the World, and ſatisfies the Duty which the ſeveral Relations and Capacities he ſtands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from him; that converſes with Wife, and Children, and Servants, and Neighbours, and Friends; that manages his own Eſtate, and engages in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs fit for his Condition; He, I ſay, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to act ſo many different Parts, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſeveral Characters as becomes him, hath incomparably more Work upon his Hands, and is infinitely more Valuable, if he perform it, than the Recluſe, who is determined to one ſingle thing, and hath only the Duty to himſelf to take care of. For Company and Variety of Converſation is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more hazardous, than Solitude; and Plenty much harder to manage than Want. In a State of Abſtinence, and Freedom from Buſineſs, a Man hath but one Paſs to guard; in the Uſe and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral Things, many Conſiderations muſt be attended to, many Duties diſcharged, and he lyes open to Attacks from ſeveral Quarters at once. And there is no Doubt in the World to be made, but a Man may much more eaſily conquer Himſelf to diſclaim and refuſe Riches, and Honours, great Offices and gainful Preferments, than he can go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf in the Uſe, or come off with Virtue and juſt Commendation in the Diſcharge of them. It is no very difficult Matter to live without a Wife,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:53648:275"/>but to live with a Wiſe, and behave ones ſelf in all Reſpects, as a Husband ought to do; to order and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Children, and bear due Regard, and make fit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for a Family, and all its Dependencies; is a Task Men ſeldom give themſelves the trouble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. But They that do, and make a right Judgment of it, will be very far from extolling Caelibacy, as ſome do, or think it an Argument of higher Virtue, or a State of greater Difficulty than Marriage.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor are Men leſs miſtaken, when they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Solitude</hi> is a ſafe Shelter from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Vice; and that He, who takes Sanctuary in it, and ſequeſters himſelf from the World, rides in Harbour, and is out of the Reach of Tempeſts and Temptations; for Theſe find a way to purſue, and overtake us even There. This is indeed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Retreat from the Corruptions of ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; from the Clutter and Crowd of Cares and Buſineſs, and the Miſchiefs that threaten and come upon us from Without; but there are other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Dangers from Within, which we always carry about us, and cannot run away from, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Internal Difficulties, Domeſtick and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Evils; and the Scripture takes expreſs Notice, that the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> was the Place, where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was Aſſaulted, and <hi>Tempted by the Devil.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement is a dangerous Weapon in the Hands of Young Men; ſuch as are Hot and Imprudent, Raſh and Unskilful; and there is great Reaſon to fear, that, what <hi>Crates</hi> ſaid to a Young Man whom he found walking all alone, is generally true of ſuch Perſons; and that ſuch, when they are by Themſelves, are in very bad Company. This is the Place where Fools lay their wicked Projects; here they find Leiſure and Opportunities for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving their own Ruine; here they cheriſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge unlawful Deſires; file, and poliſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine upon their own Paſſions, without Obſervation,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:53648:276"/>without Controul. A Man had need be very Wiſe, to know how to make the beſt Uſe of Privacy; watchful and well fortify'd, before he is fit to be truſted with Himſelf; For many times ones Own Hands, are the very Worſt he can be put into. It is an excellent Petition, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe, even to a Proverb,<note n="*" place="bottom">Guarda mi, Dios de mi. Nemo eſt ex imprudentibus, qui ſibi relinqui debeat. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo omnia perſuadet.</note> 
                           <hi>O Lord, I beſeech thee, preſerve me from My Self. Very few indeed, have diſcretion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be left to Themſelves, and nothing is ſo bad, but Secrecy and Solitude, are powerful Temptations to comply with it.</hi> But for Men to take up their Heels, and skulk in a Corner, upon any Private and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Conſideration, though it be a lawful and commendable one in it ſelf, which yet is the beſt, and not always the Truth of the Caſe (for very often Cowardice, and Weakneſs of Spirit, Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pets, or ſome other diſcontented or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſion is at the Bottom of all this pompous and pretended Contempt of the World) is to turn Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not dare to ſtand to our Arms. There is a mighty Difference between forſaking the World, and falling out with it; between conquering, and not hazarding our Perſons in the Engagement. And when Men are in a Capacity of becoming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to Others, and may be Inſtruments of Great and General Good, to excuſe Themſelves from ſerving the Publick, and abandon all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when they might adorn and be uſeful in it, is to betray their Truſt, to <hi>bury their Talent in a Napkin;</hi> to <hi>hide the Candle,</hi> which God hath lighted, <hi>under a Buſhel,</hi> when the ſetting it on a Candle-Stick, might <hi>enlighten</hi> others, and do great Service to <hi>all that are in the Houſe.</hi> It requires then much Deliberation, and many uncommon Circumſtances, to give Men a
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53648:276"/>Right thus to diſpoſe of Themſelves. And they who preſume to do it merely out of private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and make the Publick no part of their Concern, are ſo far from deſerving to be applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Virtue and Reſignation, that they are guilty of a great Fault, and liable to very juſt and ſevere Cenſure.</p>

                        <p>SOme Perſons have been of Opinion, that a <hi>Life,</hi> where all Things are <hi>in Common,</hi> and there is no ſuch Diſtinction as <hi>Mine</hi> or <hi>Thine,</hi> hath the greateſt Tendency to Perfection, and is beſt accommodated for the cheriſhing and maintaining of Charity and Concord, and Union among Men. But Experience ſhews us daily, that whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies it may really have of this kind, yet are they not ſo great, nor ſo effectual to the Purpoſes before-mention'd, as thoſe Perſons have imagined. For in the firſt Place, whatever Appearance there may be outwardly of Kindneſs and good Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meent, yet there is no ſuch Thing as an entire and hearty Affection, nor the ſame tender Regards for That which is in Common, as a Man finds where he alone is concern'd. To this purpoſe it is, that we have two Proverbs, <hi>The College Horſe is always ill ſaddled,</hi> and <hi>Every Body's Buſineſs, is No Body's Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</hi> Men conſider, that Others are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Care, and in the Damage; that the Loſs is not immediately their own, and that each Member of the Society ſtands in that reſpect equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:53648:277"/>related to them, and that begets a Coldneſs and Indifferency among them. But, which is a great deal worſe, this State does naturally produce Quarrels and Diſcontents, Murmuring and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Hatred; every Community is but too full a Demonſtration of it, and the very Holieſt and Beſt that ever was, the Primitive Church it ſelf, could not, you ſee, be exempted from the Misfortune. For, though the Inſtitution deſign all Things ſhould be equal, yet unleſs you could make the Deſires of the Perſons ſo too, they will always be full of Complaints, and Jealous, that ſome are preferred, and others neglected;<note place="margin">Acts vi.</note> like the <hi>Grecians</hi> and their Widows in the Daily Diſtributions. The Nature of <hi>Love,</hi> is like that of Great Rivers; which, while they continue united in one Stream are Navigable, and carry Veſſels of Vaſt Burden; but if you cut them into freſh Channels, and divide the Water, they are no longer Serviceable in that kind; and thus, when Men's Affections are divided, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were among a great many Objects, not any one of thoſe Perſons or Things is of very tender Concern; for all the Force and Vigor of the Paſſion is ſcattered and broke to Pieces. Now, in a <hi>Life of Community,</hi> there are ſeveral Degrees; <hi>To live,</hi> that is, to eat and drink together at a common Table, is very decent and well, (Thus we find it practiſed in ſome of the beſt and moſt ancient Commonwealths, as <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> particularly) ſuch publick Meals are very uſeful for the teaching Men to be Modeſt and reſerved, and keeping up Dicipline, Society, and Good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and they do alſo miniſter occaſion for great variety of very uſeful and improving Diſcourſe. But to think of pulling up the Fences and Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and lay all in Common, is a wild Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Plato</hi> was once of this Opinion, but he thought better of it afterwards. And indeed the Project
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:53648:277"/>would be ſo far from reconciling and uniting All, that the certain Conſequence of it would be to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and confound All.</p>

                        <p>THis is a Compariſon very eaſie for any Man who is a true Lover of Wiſdom, to make; for almoſt all the Advantages lie on one ſide. The Pleaſures and Conveniences both of Body and Mind, Liberty, Contemplation, Innocence, Health, and Delight. In the <hi>Country</hi> a Man's Mind is free and eaſie; diſcharg'd, and at his own Diſpoſal: But in the <hi>City</hi> the Perſons of Friends and Acquaintance, one's own and other People's Buſineſs, fooliſh Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, ceremonious Viſits, impertinent Diſcourſe, and a Thouſand other Fopperies and Diverſions ſteal away the greateſt part of our Time, and leave no Leiſure for better and more neceſſary Employment. What infinite Perplexities, Avocations, Diſtractions of the Mind, and, which is worſt of all, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Debaucheries, and Depravation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners does ſuch a Life expoſe Men to? Great Towns are but a larger ſort of Priſons to the Soul, like Cages to Birds, or Pounds to Beaſts. This Celeſtial Fire within us will not endure to be ſhut up, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Air to brighten and make it burn clear; which made <hi>Columella</hi> ſay, that a Country Life is Couſin-German to Wiſdom: For a Man's Thoughts cannot be idle; and when they are ſet looſe from the World, they will range and expatiate freely in noble and profitable Meditations. But how ſhall a
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:53648:278"/>Man hope to command his Thoughts, or pretend to call them his Own, in the midſt of all the Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Buſineſs, the Amuſements, nay the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of the Town? A Country Life is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more plain, and innocent, and diſpoſed to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Virtue. In Cities Vice aſſembles in Troops; the very Commonneſs of it makes it unobſerv'd; it hardens and reconciles us to the Practice, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Cuſtom; and the meeting with it at every Turn, makes the thing familiar; and thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe ſeizes us ſtrongly and preſently, and we are gone all on the ſudden, by living in the midſt of the Inſection. Whereas in the Country, thoſe things are ſeen or heard with Abhorrence and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, which the Town ſees and does every Day without Remorſe or Concern. As for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Health, the clear Air, the Warmth and Brightneſs of the Sun, not polluted with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gleams, and loathſome Stenches of the Town; the Springs and Waters, the Flowers and Groves, and, in ſhort, All Nature is free, and eaſie, and gay; The Earth unlocks her Treaſures, refreſhes us with her Fruits, feaſts every Senſe, and gives us ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as Cities know nothing of, in the ſtifling preſs of Houſes; ſo that to live there, is to ſhut one's ſelf up, and be baniſh'd from the World. Beſides all this, a Country Retirement is more active, and ſit for Exerciſe; and this creates an Appetite, preſerves and reſtores Health and Vigour, hardens the Body, and makes it luſty and ſtrong. The greateſt Commendation of the Town is, Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience for Buſineſs and Profit. It is indeed the Seat of Trade and private Gain, and therefore fit to be the Darling of Merchants and Artificers: And it is the Place accommodated to Publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; but this latter but a very ſmall part of Mankind are call'd to, or capable of. And Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory tells us, that heretofore excellent Perſons
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53648:278"/>were fetch'd out of the Country, to undertake Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the greateſt Importance; and aſſoon as they had finiſh'd theſe, they retir'd again with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Delight, and made the Town not a Matter of Choice, but Neceſſity and Conſtraint: This was the ſhort Scene of Labour and Buſineſs to them; but the Country was the Seat of their Pleaſure, and more conſtant Reſidence.</p>

                        <p>THE Profeſſion and Employment of a <hi>Soldier,</hi> if we reſpect the Cauſe and Original Deſign of it, is very worthy and honourable; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to protect the Safety, and promote the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of one's native Country; to preſerve it in Peace, and guard it from the Inſults of Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and turbulent Spirits at home; than which nothing can be more juſt, nothing more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally beneficial. It is alſo noble and great in the Execution of this Deſign: For <hi>Courage,</hi> which is its proper Quality and Character, is the braveſt, moſt generous, moſt Heroick of all Virtues; And of all Humane Actions and Exploits, Thoſe of War are the moſt celebrated and pompous; inſomuch that the Titles and Enſigns of Honour, borrow their Names from, and are aſſign'd as Rewards to Them. It hath alſo many Pleaſures peculiar to it; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Men of the firſt Quality, in heat of Youth, and full of Fire and Activity; the being familiarly acquainted with ſtrange Accidents, and wonderful entertaining Sights; freedom of Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and Converſe without Trick or Art; a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53648:279"/>and hardy way of living, above Ceremony or Form; Variety of Attempts and Succeſſes: The moving Harmony of warlike Muſick, which entertains the Ears, charms all the Senſes, warms the Soul, and inſpires it with Valour; the Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Motion and Diſcipline, that tranſport and delight us with a pleaſing Horrour; that Storm of Shouts and Alarms, which the louder it grows, the more raviſhing and animating it is; and the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance of ſo many Thouſand Men that fall on with incredible fury and eagerneſs.</p>

Nothing is a ſtronger Evidence againſt Mankind, of their Weakneſs, and Imperfection, and foul Degeneracy; for it ſets us below the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brutes themſelves, in the moſt ſavage of which the Original Impreſſions of Nature are not defac'd to this ſcandalous Degree. What an infinite Folly, what an execrable Rage is it, to create all this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, and turn the World upſide-down, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and run thro' ſo many Hazards by Sea and Land, for a Prize ſo very doubtful and full of Chance, as the event of a Battle? Why ſhould we make Campaigns abroad, and turn Volunteers to foreign Princes, to run with ſo much eagerneſs and appetite after Death, (which may be found, nay which of its own accord meets us at home, and offers it ſelf every where) and that without propoſing to our ſelves ſo much as decent Burial?

                        <p>THis Laſt Diſtinction is abundantly notorious, and viſible to every Eye; It hath indeed ſeveral Branches and Conſiderations included under it; but all I think may be conveniently enough reduced to Two General Heads; which, according to the vulgar way of Expreſſion, may be termed, Happineſs and Unhappineſs; being High or Low in the World. To that of Happineſs or Greatneſs, belong Health, Beauty, and other Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Advantages of Body and Perſon, Liberty, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Honour, Authority, Learning, Riches, Reputation, Friends. In Unhappineſs or Meanneſs of Condition are comprehended the Contraries of all Theſe, which, without naming particularly, we eaſily underſtand to be the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or want of the foremention'd Advantages. Now theſe Particulars are the occaſion of infinite variety in Men's Circumſtances and Conditions of Life; for a Man may be happy in the Enjoyment of One, or Two, or Three of theſe Qualities, and yet not ſo in the reſt; and even in
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:53648:280"/>Thoſe he hath, he may be happy in a greater or leſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and thoſe Degrees are capable of being ſo many, that it is not eaſie, if at all poſſible, to expreſs or conceive them. But upon the whole Matter, in the Diſtribution and Diſpoſal of our Fortunes and Affairs, Providence hath ſo ordered it, that Few or None ſhould be either hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or unhappy in every one of theſe Reſpects. He then that partakes of moſt, and particularly thoſe Three Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, of Nobility, Dignity or Authority, and Riches, is eſteem'd Great; and he that hath none of thoſe Three is reckoned among the mean Men. But ſeveral Perſons have only One or Two of the Three; and ſo they ſtand in a ſort of middle Capacity, between the two Extremes, and are neither High nor Low. We will ſpeak very briefly to each of them.</p>

                           <hi>LIberty</hi> paſſes in the Eſteem of many for a moſt eminent Advantage, and <hi>Servitude</hi> for a very grievous Evil; ſo exceeding great, that ſome have rather choſen to Die, and that after a very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and painful manner, than to be made Slaves or Captives; nay, rather than come into any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſeeing their own, or their Countrey's Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Properties infringed, or uſurp'd upon. But as in all Other Caſes of the like Nature, ſo in This alſo, there may be a very Criminal Exceſs of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:53648:281"/>Partiality, and a fanciful Fondneſs of what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly have a high eſteem for. There is in truth a <hi>Twofold Liberty:</hi> The true and proper ſort is That of the Mind; for This is in every Man's own Keeping and Diſpoſal, no body can wreſt it out of our Hands, nothing can impair or encroach upon it, not even the Tyranny of Fortune it ſelf. On the other ſide, The <hi>Bondage of the Mind</hi> is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt, and moſt wretched of all others; to live a Slave to one's Appetites and Luſts; to lie down in our Chains, and let our Paſſions prey upon us; to be led by the Noſe by Prejudice, and Error, and Superſtition: Oh This! This is a miſerable Captivity indeed. The <hi>Liberty of one's Perſon</hi> is really valuable, but ſtill that lies at the Mercy of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And as valuable as it is, yet (unleſs it be attended with ſome very uncommon Circumſtance to enhance its Worth) there can never be Juſtice or Reaſon in giving it the Preference above Life it ſelf; as ſome of the Ancients have done, who choſe to ſuffer, nay, to inflict Death, and make it the Work of their Own Hands upon Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather than not die free: And even of this (to me ſeeming) Extravagance we find large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, as if it were a more exalted Virtue than ordinary, ſo very dreadful Notions had they then of <hi>Slavery.</hi>

                           <hi>NObility</hi> is a Quality or Diſtinction receiv'd and valu'd in all parts of the World: It is a Mark and an Attractive of Honour and Reſpect, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought into Uſe for very good Reaſons, and much to the Benefit of the Publick.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is not every where the ſame; but differently reputed, and taken in divers Senſes,<note place="margin">Deſcription of it.</note> according to the different Judgments of Men, and the Cuſtoms of the Countries where they live. From hence we find ſeveral Sorts or Species of it pretended to; but according to the common and moſt general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing, it is the Quality of a Man's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, the <hi>Antiquity of the Family, and the long Continuance of an Eſtate in it. Plutarch</hi> terms it the <hi>Virtue of the Family;</hi> meaning by this, ſome certain Character, and particular good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for which our Anceſtors were eminent, and which hath been propagated in Succeſſion, and is continu'd in the ſeveral Deſcendents of that Houſe. Now what this Quality is in particular, which ſhould merit ſuch a Diſtinction, hath not been agreed on all hands. Some, and indeed the greater part, will have it to be Atchievements in War; others add, or equal to this, Politick and Civil Prudence; whereby Men become neceſſary to the State by their Counſels, as the former do in
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53648:282"/>the Field: To Theſe have likewiſe been added Eminence in Learning, and particular Offices in the Courts of Princes, as Accompliſhments thought fit and ſufficient to diſtinguiſh a Man's Family, and deriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I think it muſt be acknowledg'd by all conſidering Perſons, that the Military Honours have the Advantage, and deſerve a Preference above all the reſt, both becauſe the Qualities of this kind are moſt ſerviceable to the State in its greateſt Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Diſtreſſes; and becauſe it is the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and laborious, and expoſes Men's Perſons to the greateſt and moſt apparent Dangers. From whence it is, that a particular Veneration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a louder Applauſe and Commendation is allowed univerſally to Them; and that Theſe by way of Eminence and Privilege, have attain'd to that diſtinguiſhing Character of Valour or Worth. Now according to this Opinion, Two things are neceſſary, and muſt both contribute as Ingredients to the Compoſition of that which is the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Perfect Nobility.</hi> Firſt, There muſt be the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Appearance of this Virtue or good Quality ſerviceable to the Publick, and this is as it were the Form; and then there muſt be the Family, in which, as in the Matter or proper Subject, this Quality is inherent; that is, there is requir'd a long uninterrupted Continuation of it, thro' ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, and Time out of mind. Hence, according to the vulgar Jargon, they are ſtiled <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that is, Perſons who are Branches and Deſcendents of the ſame Blood, and Houſe; Bearing the ſame Name, and the ſame Profeſſion of this diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality, for ſeveral Generations. That Perſon then is truly, properly, and entirely Noble, who makes ſingular Profeſſion of ſome Publick Virtue; that renders himſelf uſeful and remarkable in the Service of his Prince and his Country; and is

                        <p>IT is the Notion of ſome, but a very miſtaken Notion ſure it is, That Honour is the proper Price and Recompenſe of Virtue. Others have a little corrected this Notion, by calling it, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Virtue in the Perſons to whom we pay it, or the Prerogative of a good Opinion firſt, and then of thoſe outward Reſpects, whereby we te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſie that good Opinion; for it is moſt certainly a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege that derives its Eſſence and Nature Principally from Virtue. Others call it Virtue's Shadow, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or goes before it; as the Shadow does the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Body from whence it is reflected. But, to ſpeak more properly, it is the Splendor or Fame of brave and virtuous Actions, darted out from the Soul upon the Eyes of the World, and then rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again upon our ſelves, by that Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration it gives of what others think of us, and the mighty Satisfaction of the Mind reſulting from this Senſe of their Good Eſteem.</p>
                        <p>Now, <hi>Honour</hi> is ſo very highly eſteemed, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eagerly ſought, that we generally balk no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to come at it. We endure any thing for its ſake, deſpiſe every thing in Compariſon of it; even Life it ſelf is not thought a Purchaſe too
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:53648:286"/>Dear to compaſs it. And yet after All, This is but a thin, airy Buſineſs, uncertain and ſickle; foreign and at ſome diſtance from the Perſon receiving it, and the things for which it is paid. It is not only not Eſſential to him, not any part or Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Perſon, and Subſtance, but it ſearce ever comes home to him. For generally ſpeaking, this Deference is given to Perſons either Abſent or Dead; and if Living, it is not accounted good Manners to praiſe them to their Faces; ſo that it waits without, and belongs to a Man's Name only; which bears all his Commendations and Diſgraces, his Scandal, and his Reſpects; from whence one is ſaid to bear a <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Wicked Name.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, the <hi>Name</hi> is no part of the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> but only the Image which gives us a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it.

For it is applied to the Subſtance, and whatever is ſaid of it, Good, or Fad, falls upon This; and is born by it. Now <hi>Honour,</hi> before it reſts upon the Name fetches a kind of Circular Flight; and makes ſome ſtay upon the Action, the Heart and the Tongue. Whatever gallant, commendable Action is Atchieved, is, as it were, the Root, the Source, the Parent which gives birth and Being to Honour; for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next Advance is made into the Mind, where it firſt begins to live, and is form'd into good Opinions,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:53648:286"/>and Venerable Eſteem. Then it comes abroad in the laſt Place, and rides Triumphant upon Men's Tongues and Pens; and ſo reflects and returns back again, upon the Name of the Perſon, who did that Celebrated Action, from whence it firſt ſet out (As the Sun returns Daily to the Point from whence his Motion began,) and when it hath finiſh'd this Courſe, it from thenceforch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Name of <hi>Honour,</hi> Praiſe, Glory, Renown, or the like.</p>
                        <p>But to what Sorts of Performances this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is due, hath been a Queſtion much diſputed. Some Perſons have delivered their Opinion, that Honour does not only, nor properly conſiſt in a Man's behaving himſelf well, where great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Poſts are to be filled and managed by him (for every Man's Circumſtances will not furniſh him with Opportunities of weighty Adminiſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) but in the faithful Diſcharge of the Duties of each Perſon's particular Profeſſion, be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Man what it will. For all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is the Effect and Reward of a Man's performing commendably, that which is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs to do. Thus we find Reaſon and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, determine us in publick Theatres, which are but ſo many Images in little of this Great Theatre of the Univerſe. The Condition and Splendor of the Character is not enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor weighs at all with our Judgments; but He, who upon the Stage, plays the Part of a Servant or Buſſoon, if he do it well, and to the Life, meets with as much Applauſe, as if he had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a General, or an Emperour. And he that cannot work in Gold, if he ſhew the Perfection of his Art, and carve the Poſtures and Proportions well, in Copper, or in Plaiſter, is reputed a good Statuary; becauſe this Excellence depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fineneſs or Value of the Materials, but in
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:53648:287"/>the Skill ſhewed upon them. But yet it ſeems more reaſonable to think, that Honour is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for ſomething more Noble and Sublime than Ordinary; and that no Actions, but ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which have Difficulty or Danger in them, can make juſt Pretenſions to it. Thoſe that are but juſt what they ought to be, ſuch as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Stations require, and proceeding from a Senſe of Obligation and Duty, cannot aſpire to ſo great Worth, nor put in for ſo ample a Reward; a Reward which is diſparaged by being made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Ordinary, and not ſuited to all Degrees of Perſons and Performances. Thus every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and chaſte Wife, and every Man of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and good Conduct, is not therefore a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Honour. For there muſt go more than Probity to the denominating them ſo; there muſt be Pains, and Difficulty, and Danger; nay, and, ſome will tell you, there muſt be ſomewhat of general Good, and Advantage to the Publick, to juſtifie that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in its full and true Extent. Let a Man's Actions be never ſo Good, never ſo Uſeful, if they be private and the Advantage redound to himſelf alone, another ſort of Payment belongs to them. They will have the Approbation of his own Conſcience; they will procure the Love, and Favour, and good Word of his Neighbours and Acquaintance; they will enſure his Safety, and put him under the Protection of the Law; but except the Influence and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them be large and diffuſive, they cannot come up to Honour; for Honour is a publick Thing, and implyes more of Dignity; and comprehends Splendor and Noiſe, Admiration, and Common Fame in the Nature and Notion of it. Others add farther, that an Honourable Action muſt not be a part of our Duty, but perfectly free and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogating; for if Men were obliged to it, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Of the Marks of Honour there is great Variety; but the moſt deſirable and charming, are Thoſe, where there are no Mixtures of private Gain and Intereſt; ſuch as nothing can be drawn out of, nor any Share lie in Common, for the Advantage of a Vicious Man; or of ſuch low and inferiour People, as ſhall pretend to ſerve the Publick by mean and diſhonourable Offices. The leſs of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they bring with them, the more Valuable they are. And accordingly we find the Ancients infinitely fond of, and with all their Induſtry and Pains, aſpiring after thoſe, which had nothing elſe
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:53648:288"/>to recommend them, but purely their being Marks of Diſtinction, and Characteriſtical Notes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Virtue. Of this Nature in the ſeveral Republicks of old, were the Garlands of Laurel and Oaken-Leaves, (and ſo are the particular <q>Bearings in Coats of Arms at this Day, added to the former Charges of the Field, upon ſome ſpecial piece of Service) diſtinct Habits,</q> and Robes; the Prerogative of ſome Sirname, as <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the like: Precedence and Place in publick Aſſemblies, and Orders of Knighthood. It may alſo fall out, that, when a Man's Deſerts are Notorious and Celebrated, it ſhall be more for his Honour, not to have theſe Enſigns and Marks, than to have them. And therefore <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid well, that it would make more for the Glory of his Name and Virtues, that People ſhould ask why the City had not erected a Statue to his Memory in the Forum, than that they ſhould enquire, why they had done it.</p>

                        <p>LEarning is, without all Diſpute, a Noble and Beautiful Ornament; an Inſtrument of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſe, when in the Hands of one, that hath the Skill to uſe it aright. But what Place and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it deſerves in our Eſteem, is a Matter not ſo generally agreed upon. And here, as in all Caſes of the like Nature, Men fall into Extremes, and are to blame in both; Some in overvalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Others in diſparaging and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing it. Some run it up to that Extravagant
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:53648:288"/>Height, that they will not allow any other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to come near, or be thought comparable to it; They look upon it, as the Supreme Happineſs; a Ray and Efflux of the Divinity; they hunt after it with Eagerneſs and inſatiable Appetite; with vaſt expence, and indefatigable Labour and Pains; and are content to part with Eaſe, and Health, and every Thing in exchange for it. Others as much diminiſh and deſpiſe it; treat Thoſe with Scorn who make it their Buſineſs and Profeſſion. And when we have obſerved this of either ſide, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Reader will make no Difficulty to allow, that a Moderation between both is beſt, moſt ſafe, moſt juſt and reaſonable. I, for my own part, were I to execute the Herald's Office in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, ſhould think that Place is without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion due to Integrity and Prudence, to Health and Wiſdom, and Virtue, nay,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Now, as Sciences differ from each other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Subjects of which they treat, and the Matters they are employed about; and alſo in the Manner of acquiring, and attaining to a Maſtery in them; ſo do they likewiſe in the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, the Reputableneſs, the Neceſſity, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the Fame, and the Gain of them. Some are purely Speculative, and aim at nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than merely Contemplation, the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, informing, improving, brightening our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculties. Others are Practical, and lead us directly on to Action. Some again are Real,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:53648:289"/>and Converſant in Things; they bring us acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Matters that are without us, either Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Supernatural Objects; Others are Nominal, They concern Diſcourſe only, teach us Languages, explain Terms of Arts, help us to expreſs our ſelves properly, and to reaſon regularly and cloſely. Now, from this ſhort Account, we may boldly ſay, That upon a Review of the foregoing Diſtinctions, Thoſe Sciences, which are moſt Manly and Reputable, moſt Uſeful, moſt Neceſſary, and have leaſt of Glory, and Vanity, and ſordid mercenary Profit attending them, are infinitely Preferable to the reſt. By the ſame reaſon then it follows beyond all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that the Practical Sciences are of all others the moſt excellent; ſuch as propoſe the Good and Happineſs of Man for their End, and direct all their Inſtructions thither; that teach us to live, and to die well; to command and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, to ſubmit and obey as becomes us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Theſe are worthy our moſt Serious Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Who ever pretends to Wiſdom, muſt lay out his Study and his Time here; and of ſuch, this Book is deſign'd to be a Compendious Summary and Abridgment: that is, of Morals, Oeconomicks, and Politicks; the Firſt for governing our Selves well; the Second for mannaging our domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and preſiding over our Families well; and the Third for diſcharging our publick Offices well, if we be call'd to any part in the Adminiſtration of the Government; or if we be private and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate only in both the laſt Capacities, then to conſider and make good the Duties incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any the meaneſt and moſt inferior Character. Next to theſe Practical Sciences, the Natural are to be regarded and eſteemed, which let us into the Knowledge of this Syſtem, and Fabrick of the Univerſe, and the infinite Variety of Creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:53648:289"/>in it; and that, both for our own Uſe and Benefit, ſo far as they can be ſerviceable to us, and alſo to excite our Wonder, and Praiſe, and moſt Humble Adoration of His incomprehenſible Majeſty, and Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Power, who is the Great Maſter-Builder, the conſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and Governour of All, and every Part of it. As for all the reſt, they are empty and frothy Things in Compariſon; and though we may call in upon them by the by, and for a little while, yet ought we not to ſet up our Reſt there, nor make them the Buſineſs of our Lives; becauſe the Uſe and Effect of them is of no great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and they contribute nothing at all towards the making us one whit better Men. To what purpoſe then is all that Time, and Trouble, and Expence, and how can we think it otherwiſe than loſt, or miſemploy'd, which we ſee Studious Men ſometimes lay out ſo liberally upon them? It is true, they may ſerve to get Money, or to raiſe ſomething of a Reputation among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but it is where Men are Ignorant or ill-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only: For otherwiſe they will ſeek and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch Studies, as bring ſolid Comforts and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and are built upon a firm Bottom.</p>

                        <p>THeſe are the two Foundations and Beginnings, the Root and Source of all the Troubles and Calamities, the Diſorders and Diſturbances, that confound, and put the World out of Courſe: For exceſs of Plenty and Riches exalts and puffs up the Poſſeſſors, renders them haughty and inſolent, ſwells them with Pride and Diſdain, prompts them to, Luxury and Extravagance, to Senſuality and all manner of unlawful Pleaſures; encourages them to uſe their Inferiours contemptuouſly, and to inſult over their Wants and their Miſeries; makes them bold and daring, and in con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The extreme Poverty of Others ſubdues and dejects their Spirits, poyſons them with Envy and reſtleſs Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, with Indignation and Spight, Diſcontent and Deſpair; and, ſince Matters, they think, cannot be worſe, provokes them to try their Fortunes, and make a deſperate Puſh, in hopes they may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Plato</hi> calls the Poor the <hi>Bane and Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53648:290"/>upon the account of that Wealth, gives them Power and Opportunities to be very troubleſome. <hi>Plato</hi> thinks Poverty the worſe; for when Poor People are grown deſperate, they are furious and terrible Creatures; when they are irritated and enrag'd with want of Bread, and cannot live upon their Work; when Trading is dead, and they are overburden'd with Taxe; then Neceſſity, (which is a great Miſtreſs, and finds her Scholars very apt) teaches them That, which they would never have ventur'd upon in better and more eaſie Circumſtances; and this makes them bold as Lions: For tho' each of them ſingle can do little or no hurt, yet their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are always great, and theſe give them Confidence. But whatever the Diſeaſe be, 'tis certain the Remedy is more ready at hand, and the Cure eaſier, for the Poor than for the Rich; this Miſchief is quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, and may be timely prevented. For ſo long as they have Neceſſaries, ſo long as they can carry on their Trades, and maintain their Families by them, they are generally contented. And therefore it highly concerns all Governours to preſerve and encourage Trade, becauſe in ſo doing they are ſure to keep good Order among the laborious, and hardy, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous; which to be ſure are generally the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous part of their Subjects. In the mean while, we may obſerve this very remarkable Difference between them, that the Rich have the Temptation within Themſelves, and are formidable upon the account of their own Perſonal Vices, and the Circumſtances they are in; but the Poor are not ſo from Themſelves, nor their Condition, but if ever They min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now ſeveral Lawgivers, and eminent Politicians have apply'd their Minds to contrive proper Methods for the keeping off, and ſecuring the States they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:53648:291"/>or preſided over, from the Inconveniences atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding each of theſe Extremes; and ſuch as ſo vaſt a Diſproportion of Eſtates and Fortunes will naturally expoſe the Publick to. They have been therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bring all nearer to a Level, to reduce the one, and raiſe the other; ſo that there ſhould be a kind of univerſal Mediocrity, and pretty near an equal Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: When Things ſtood upon this Foot, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Themſelves a ſure Foundation of Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and good Correſpondence, by removing all the Grounds of Contempt on the one hand, and of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Jealouſie on the other, quite out of the way. Others have ſtretched this Project yet further; they are for introducing a common Stock, and leaving no peculiar Rights or Properties at all. But this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and fantaſtical, and never can exiſt long any where, but in Men's own Brains and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nor is that other Deſign of Equality any more practicable, or indeed at all poſſible. For tho' Men's Income be alike, yet their Expences and Occaſions will be far from being ſo. Theſe may vary upon a Thouſand Accidents; but it is enough that every body is able to ſee and inſtance in one, which is perfectly unanſwerable; and that is the Number of Children, which we all know neither do, nor ever can increaſe in every Family alike. And therefore it muſt needs be inſufficient, and the Deſign loſt, where the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are not, nor ever can be equal. All the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have been at any time made toward the putting in practice this Levelling Principle, have ſcarce ever been able to ſet it on Foot: It coſts more than the Thing is worth to come to it; and if Men could arrive at it, yet it is highly inexpedient, and not at all to their Purpoſe. The End they aim at is never thus to be compaſſed; for after all, this is at laſt but to open another Door, and let the very Miſchief in the back way, which we take ſo much Pains to keep out. For if Hatred and Contention be the Evils we are afraid of, where do we find Theſe more frequent
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:53648:291"/>and fierce than between Equals? How can we indeed reaſonably expect it otherwiſe, where Men think Themſelves a Match for one another, where there is no Diſtance or Reſpect to Temper, no Fear to curb and bind them to the Peace and their good Behaviour? If Envy and Jealouſies ariſe againſt Superiours, ſo do they likewiſe among Equals; and this latter ſort is the Seed of Diſturbances and Confuſions, Seditions and Civil Wars. Some Diſproportion therefore is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, but ſuch as is moderate, and may keep the Balance even and ſteady. Order is like Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if all Sounds wee the ſame, there could be no Muſick; but yet it is neceſſary theſe different Notes ſhould agree in general Cords, and retain ſome Proportion to make the Compoſition regular and ſweet. But a perfect Level is like a continu'd Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and nothing is more flat,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nihil eſt aequalitate inaequalius.</note> 
                           <hi>nothing more unequal than an exact Equality.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This ſo very great Diſparity of Eſtates and Poſſeſſions prceeds from ſeveral very different Cauſes; but more eſpecially from Two. The One is unjuſt Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and hard Loans; when Men are forced and content to take up Money at any rate, and ſubmit to all the unconſcionable Intereſts that Griping Uſurers put upon them; by which means thoſe Unjuſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors eat into their Eſtates, gnaw out their very Heart and Bowels, and by degrees ſwallow all, and ſo grow fat upon the Subſtance of other People. To ſuch as Theſe may that Complaint of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> not improperly be apply'd,<note place="margin">Pſal. liii. 5</note> 
                           <hi>They eat up my People as they would eat Bread.</hi> The Other is by Diſpoſals of Eſtates, and that either by Men during their own Life-time, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienations, Dowries, and Portioning of Children when they Marry, or ſet up in the World; or elſe by laſt Will, and Bequeſt at the time of their Death. By all which Means, and by the Frugality and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſome, and the extravagant Profuſeneſs
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:53648:292"/>of Others, it comes to paſs, that ſome Men's Fortunes are prodigiouſly increaſed, and others ſunk and crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into nothing. A Prodigal Heir makes all fly, and his Poſterity continue poor after him: A great Fortune marries with a vaſt Eſtate; and here one Heap is pil'd upon another: A rich Heireſs carries off the Eſtate and Paternal Seat, incorporates it into another Houſe, and ſo the Wealth and Name of her own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is either dreadfully maim'd and enfeebl'd, or cut off and quite extinct at once. Theſe are plain and obvious Reaſons, why ſome Men gain ſuch mighty Advantages over Others; and ſhew us how ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are reduced to nothing, and others again flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh as much, and are wonderfully ſtrengthen'd and exalted. Now all theſe things ſhould be taken into Conſideration, and other Meaſures taken to regulate and reform the Miſchiefs that grow from them. For tho' a perfect Equality be impracticable, yet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Moderation is not: And if all be not Even, yet there is no neceſſity that all ſhould be in Extremes; we may, and it is reaſonable we ſhould bring Matters nearer together, and make ſome tolerable Approaches towards ſuch a Mediocrity as is reaſonable. Such an one as is reaſonable, I ſay; for an entire and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough one is neither reaſonable, nor expedient, nor honeſt. This may be effected in ſome good Degree by private Perſons, in the management and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of their Own Affairs: And it may be advanc'd higher by the wholſom Conſtitutions and Counſels of Thoſe in a publick Capacity: And both are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have Regard to it. But of this we ſhall have ſome occaſion to ſpeak more at large, when the Virtue of <hi>Juſtice</hi> comes to be treated of.</p>

                  <p>Where Providence confers the External Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Life only, the Greater and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable part is ſtill behind. Very few are more than half-bleſt; and of Them who are, or call themſelves unhappy, the Generality are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not from real Want of what they need, but from an Incapacity of enjoying what they have. Hence it is ſtill accounted a Moot-point in Philoſophy, whether Proſperity or Adverſity, Plenty or Penury, require greater management and addreſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Crates.</note> One of ſome Name, we know, among thoſe Sages durſt not ſo much as truſt himſelf with the Temptation of Riches. You, Sir, very juſtly reproach his behaviour with Raſhneſs and Folly, by ſhewing, that not the Sea, but a Soul large and diffuſive as the Sea rather, is neceſſary to deliver a man from the danger of a plentiful Fortune. This does not only ſecure, but render Him and It a publick Bleſſing, by Acts of Goodneſs, Munificence, Hoſpitality; By cultivating thoſe Social Virtues whereby Mankind are ſuſtained, cemented, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to one another, and all thoſe important and beneficial Ends accompliſhed, to which the <hi>Giver of</hi> theſe <hi>Good Gifts</hi> deſigns they ſhould be ſerviceable.</p>

                  <p> The Difficulties, under which moſt Men miſcarry, are not avoided by abandoning the World, but by uſing it in ſo maſterly a manner, as always to keep above it. Ambition and Avarice ſometimes inhabit the moſt retired Cloiſters; and are (no doubt) ſometimes too abſolute Strangers to Quality, and Buſineſs, and Fortune. Every one is valuable in proportion as he is Uſeful; but Uſeful They can be but very little, who induſtriouſly decline the occaſions of being ſo. The Man of Converſation and Civil Society is therefore that Pattern of Wiſdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and drawn by this Author. And to the ſame purpoſe, all perfect Syſtems of Morality enlarge upon the different Capacities of Men; becauſe the Offices reſulting from thence make the chief part of Chriſtian, as well as Human Prudence. Theſe are the Talents peculiar to each perſon, and his proper Buſineſs diſtinct from the reſt of the World.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, when <hi>Charron</hi> accordingly treats of The true and genuine Uſe of Riches, of a Mind capable of Stemming a full tide of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; of the Integrity of Magiſtrates in Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, of the Fidelity and Vigilance of Wiſe and Worthy Patriots in the Service of their Country, and Defence of its juſt Rights; of the Tenderneſs and Prudence of Parents, and the affectionate Deference and Duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; when, I ſay, Theſe and other Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paſſed through my hands, there needed

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>HAVING in the former Book explained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the ſeveral Methods, by which Man may be let into a competent knowledge of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Condition of Humane Nature; which is the firſt part of our Undertaking, and a very proper Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Wiſdom: The next thing in order, is to enter upon the Doctrines and Precepts of Wiſdom it ſelf. Now That ſhall be done in this Second Book, by laying down ſome General Rules and Directions, reſerving for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of our Third and Laſt, thoſe that are more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and appropriated to ſpecial Perſons and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, according to which their Duties vary in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their reſpective Conditions. It was a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preamble in the mean while, to call Mens thoughts home, and fix them upon themſelves; to exhort and inſtruct them to handle, probe, and nicely to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Nature; that ſo being thus brought to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable knowledge and ſenſe of their Infirmities and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and ſadly convinced of the miſerable Condition they are by nature in, they may be put into a better Capacity of having thoſe healing and wholſome Remedies applied, which are neceſſary, in order to their Recovery and Amendment. And theſe Remedies are no other than the Inſtructions and Exhortations, proper for the attaining true Wiſdom.</p>
                  <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:53648:297"/>
                  <p> But alas! It is a prodigious, and a melancholy thing to conſider, how ſtupid and regardleſs Mankind are of their Happineſs and Amendment. What a ſtrange Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is it for a Man, not to be at all ſollicitous, to have the very Errand and Buſineſs he was ſent into the World about, well done? Every body is infinitely fond and covetous of Living, but ſcarce any body is concerned, or takes any manner of Thought, for Living as becomes him. This is the very Art which ſhould be our Chief, our only Study; and yet it is that which we are leaſt Maſters of, leaſt diſpoſed to learn. Our Inclinations, and Deſigns, our Studies, and Endeavours are (as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily ſhews) vaſtly different, even from our very Cradles, or as ſoon as we began to be capable of any. They vary according to the Temper and Conſtitution of our Bodies, the Company we keep, the Education we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by, the infinite Accidents and Occaſions of our Lives; but ſtill none of us caſts his Eyes that way, none makes it his Endeavour to manage theſe to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, none attempts heartily to improve in Wiſdom; nay, we do not at all lay this moſt neceſſary Matter to heart, we ſcarce allow it ſo much as a ſingle Thought. Or if at any time it comes in our way, accidentally, and by the by; we hear and attend to it, juſt as we would to a Tale that is told; or a piece of News, that in no degree concerns us. The Diſcourſe perhaps is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and entertaining to ſome (and but to ſome neither, for many will not endure, nor give it a patient hearing) but even thoſe who are contented, nay delighted to hear it, yet hear to very little purpoſe. The words and ſound tickle their Senſes, and that's all they do. For as to the thing it ſelf, That makes no impreſſion, gains no eſteem, kindles no deſires, at leaſt in this ſo univerſally Corrupt, and Degenerate Age of ours. In order to the being made duly ſenſible of the true worth of Wiſdom, and how much it deſerves from us, there ſeems to be ſome particular Turn in our firſt Frame, ſome Original Aptitude and Air in our
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:53648:297"/>Nature and Complexion. If Men muſt take pains, they will much more willingly employ their time, and exert their Strength and Parts in the purſuit of Things, whoſe Effects are gay, and glittering, external and ſenſible, ſuch as Ambition, and Avarice, and Paſſion, propoſe to them; But as for Wiſdom, whoſe Fruits are ſilent and gentle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and unſeen, it hath no Attractives at all for them. O wretched Men! what falſe Meaſures do we take, and how fatally are we deluded? We prefer Winds and Storms for the ſake of their Noiſe, where there is nothing but Air and Emptineſs, before Body and ſolid Subſtance, which is calm and ſtill; Opinion and Reputation, before Truth and Real Merit. Surely Man (as was ſaid in the Firſt Book) is no better than Vanity and Miſery, when ſo averſe from, ſo uncapable of Wiſdom. Every Man is tainted with the Air which he breathes and dwells in, goes in the beaten Road, and lives like his Neighbours; and when this is made a Rule, how can it be expected he ſhould take another Courſe? We follow the Track, and hunt by the Scent; nay we urge our own Vices upon other People, we are eager and warm in propagating them; we diſſemble our Paſſions, dreſs and trick them up, and then put them upon our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. None calls after us to ſtop our Career; we are not to expect it. We are all out of the way, and likely never to correct our Error, without the ſpecial favour of Heaven, and a great and generous ſtrength and firmneſs of Nature at the ſame time, diſcerning enough to obſerve the common Error in which all are intangled, but ſcarce any are ſenſible of it; daring enough, to be ſingular in minding that which no body elſe minds; and hardy and reſolute enough to judge and to live in a method quite different from the reſt of the World.</p>
                  <p>There have been indeed, ſome, though very few ſuch brave Men: I ſee them ſtill, their Memories and Names are ſweet to this day; and I ſmell their Aſhes like a rich Perfume, with incredible Admiration and Delight. But
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:53648:298"/>what hath been the effect of this uncommon Judgment? and how have they behaved themſelves with it? Truly they are for the moſt <hi>Democritus,</hi> or <hi>Heraclitus</hi> reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some ſee the Errors and Follies of Mankind, and when they have done, they only make a Jeſt of them; They divert and entertain themſelves and others, by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Repreſentation of a very Tragical thing; as if no more were neceſſary to teach Men Truth and Virtue, than merely to expoſe Falſhood and Vice. They laugh at the World; and the World is but too ridiculous; but while they make themſelves merry and good Company, they quite forget to be good-natur'd and charitable. Others are feeble and poor-ſpirited, they mince the matter, and dare not ſpeak out; they ſoften and diſguiſe their Language, mingle and ſweeten their Propoſitions to render them palatable, and make men ſwallow them before they are aware, and in a Maſs of other things, where they ſhall not taſte, or ſcarce ever be ſenſible of them.</p>
                  <p>They do not ſpeak home, diſtinctly and fully; but expreſs themſelves, like the Oracles of old, in Terms ambiguous, and ſubject to Evaſions. I, for my part, come long after them both in Time, and Merit; but I am blunt and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and deliver my ſenſe plainly and clearly. I give an Idea of Wiſdom, and Inſtructions for attaining it, ſuch as the World perhaps hath not been uſed to; and I ſhall not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if the newneſs of my Matter and Method expoſe this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tract to the Cenſures of ſuch Perſons, as have neither Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor Ability to judge calmly and maturely of the Matter, but accuſtom themſelves to condemn and run down every thing which does not hit their Humour, or agree with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have imbibed already. But who can help that, or ſecure himſelf from their Cenſures and Diſpleaſure? Let Them take their courſe; I queſtion not in the mean while, but the meek and tractable, and honeſtly diſpoſed, and likewiſe the Sublime and Celeſtial Spirits will paſs an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſtruction upon my Writings. Theſe two Extremes
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:53648:298"/>are the Seats of Quiet and Serenity; The middle Region is the place where all the Diſorders, and Storms, and Meteors are formed, as was obſerved before; and therefore thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Men act in agreement with their Principles, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what their Capacity and Condition diſpoſes them to.</p>
                  <p>Now in order to give a rough and general Draught of Wiſdom, and particularly of that part, which is the Subject of this preſent Book; we may divide the Matter of it into four Points, or general Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt conſiſts of ſuch things as are Preparatives or proper Prediſpoſitions to Wiſdom; and They are Two. <hi>1.</hi> Firſt a diſentangling the Mind from all thoſe Obſtructions that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or retard its Improvement; and of theſe ſome are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſuch as the Errors and Vices of the World, which we derive and ſuck in from abroad; and others Internal, which have their Birth and Beginning from our Selves; of which Nature are our own Appetites and Paſſions; <hi>2.</hi> The Other is a full, entire, and univerſal Liberty of the Mind; whereby it thinks and judges freely.</p>
                  <p>The Second is concerned in laying the Foundations of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom firm and durable; and Theſe are alſo Two; <hi>1.</hi> True and Eſſential Integrity, and <hi>2.</hi> The Fixing to our ſelves ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain End firſt, and then chalking out a convenient Rule for our Lives and Actions, by the keeping cloſe to which, we may be conducted to, and arrive at that End.</p>
                  <p>The Third contributes to the raiſing this Building upon thoſe Foundations; that is, laying on and finiſhing the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Functions and Duties of Wiſdom, which are Six. Three whereof principally regard our ſelves, and concern every man conſidered ſingly, and as a Man; and theſe are <hi>1.</hi> Piety; <hi>2.</hi> an Inward and due Maſtery over his Thoughts and Deſires; and <hi>3.</hi> a decent deportment and equal Temper of Mind, in all Accidents, whether of proſperous or adverſe Fortune; The
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:53648:299"/>other Three regard him as a Member of Society, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to others as well as himſelf; which are, <hi>1.</hi> A Due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Laws, and Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies; <hi>2.</hi> A modeſt and obliging Converſation with others; and <hi>3.</hi> Prudence in the management of all kind of Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is made up of the Fruits, and good Effects of Wiſdom, which are Two, <hi>1.</hi> The being conſtantly fit, and in a readineſs to die; and <hi>2.</hi> The maintaining a true and uninterrupted Tranquility of Spirit; which is indeed the Crown and Glory of Wiſdom, and the very Supreme Good and Happineſs, of which Humane Nature is Capable. Theſe taken all together make Twelve Points in the whole, and each being allowed a diſtinct Conſideration by it ſelf, this Book will accordingly contain juſt ſo many Chapters.</p>

                        <p>THE firſt ſtep towards the Knowledge of any thing being a diſtinct and adequate Idea and Comprehenſion of the Subject to be Treated of, I ſhould, according to this Rule, lay down for the firſt Rudiment of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Knowledge of a Man's Self in particular, and of the Condition of Human Nature in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. But This, having been the Subject of the entire Firſt Book, I have Reaſon to hope is ſufficiently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53648:300"/>provided for already. All therefore which I think neceſſary to repeat upon this occaſion, is, That every Perſon who makes Wiſdom his Aim and End, ought in the firſt place to be throughly well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Himſelf, and with Mankind. The true Knowledge whereof is a very important and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Study, of wonderful Efficacy and Advantage. For Man is the Subject proper for the Philoſophers Conſideration; none but the Wiſe underſtand it, and every man that does really underſtand it, is Wiſe. But at the ſame time it is a matter of great Intricacy and Difficulty; for Man is extremely addicted to fallacy and diſguiſe; ſo full of it, as to impoſe very often, not only upon other People, but upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too. Every one takes a pleaſure in cheating himſelf, is induſtrious to flatter his own Conſcience, ſolicitous to hide and extenuate his own Failings, and diligent to magnify his few commendable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Qualities; ſhutting his Eyes, and fearful to ſee the worſt of himſelf; and therefore, ſince Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, even at home, is ſo very little regarded, we cannot reaſonably think it ſtrange, that Wiſdom is ſo very rarely to be met with. For how can we expect it ſhould be otherwiſe, when ſo very few are perfect, ſo few indeed give any attention to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Leſſon in this Science, and Men are ſo far from undertaking to Inſtruct others, that they are wretchedly Ignorant and take no care of informing themſelves! How many profeſs'd Maſters, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny zealous Learners do we ſee in other matters, which are foreign, and of little or no moment, while every body neglects the buſineſs which moſt nearly concerns him; and while he is taken up with other matters abroad, is abſolutely in the dark at home! What an Unhappineſs! What an exquiſite Folly is this! How great a Reproach to the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind!</p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53648:300"/>
                        <p> Now in order to the being competently skill'd in this point, we ſhould get acquainted with all ſorts of Men, Thoſe of the moſt diſtant Countries and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, the moſt differing Tempers and Ages, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Profeſſions; (in which Hiſtory and Travelling are very conſiderable Helps) we ſhould obſerve their Motions, their Inclinations, and their ſeveral Dealings and Behaviour, not only in publick, (for theſe are full of Artifice, and conſequently leſs improving) but their moſt ſecret and reſerved Actions, the moſt natural and freeſt from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, ſuch as may let us into the dark and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious part of Human Nature, and diſcover ſome of the hidden Springs by which Men are moved. And particularly, great regard ſhould be had to thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages wherein Mens Intereſts, or particular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours come to be nearly touch'd; becauſe there the Man will be ſure to ſhew himſelf in his own true Colours.</p>
                        <p>When theſe Remarks are made, a man muſt draw them together, and form ſome general Notions and judicious Reflections from them. But particularly one muſt be very careful to deſcend into Himſelf, to try and found his own Breaſt to the bottom; that no lurking Deceit eſcape him there; but every Thought, and Word, and Action, be juſtly and nicely weighed.</p>
                        <p>The Reſult of ſuch Obſervations would certainly be, a ſad but ſerious Senſe, how miſerable and weak, how defective and poor a Creature Man is, on the one hand; and yet how vain and arrogant, how proud and preſumptuous, how bloated and big with Air and Wind, what a mere Tumour, a Bladder, a Bubble he is, on the other. The former of theſe Repreſentations will move our Compaſſion; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will raiſe our Horrour and Indignation. Now the former Book hath done him right in all theſe reſpects, by taking him to pieces, and examining every part
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53648:301"/>and feature by it ſelf; viewing him in all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Lights, and taking every Proſpect the Picture was capable of being drawn in. So that I ſhall trouble my Reader no further with any account of this nature at preſent: But hope he make a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the buſineſs of this Second Book, by the Aſſiſtances given him in the Firſt. And in order to it, we will proceed to warn him of the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in his way to Wiſdom, as They, who build, muſt firſt clear the Ground, and remove the Rubbiſh out of the way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Man, who deſires to become Wiſe, muſt at the very firſt entrance into this deſign, ſeriouſly ſet about, and ſtedfaſtly reſolve upon delivering, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and guarding himſelf effectually, from two Evils; which are directly oppoſite, and irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies to Wiſdom; and ſuch abſolute impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our progreſs in the ſtudies of it, that till They be got over, or taken out of the way, no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances can poſſibly be made. One of theſe is Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, conſiſting of the Vices, and the Opinions in common Vogue, which, by the advantage of being Popular, ſpread, and propagate Folly, like a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſeaſe; the other Internal, and conſiſts of a man's own Paſſions; ſo that in ſhort, the Two great Adverſaries we have to fear, and are moſt concerned to defend our ſelves againſt, are the World, and our Selves. And after ſuch an Advertiſement, there needs no more be ſaid to ſhew, how hard this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is: What courſe ſhall we take to get quit of theſe two, or how ſhall we run away from them? Wiſdom indeed is difficult and rare; but it is upon this account chiefly, that it is ſo; This is the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome part of it; This in a manner the ſole Conflict, we have to fear; when once This Combat is won, all the reſt is eaſy, and the Day our own. For the firſt thing, that can fit, or put us into any Capacity for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53648:301"/>Wiſdom, muſt be to get clear of that Evil, which obſtructs our whole Deſign, and will not admit Wiſdom to dwell with, or grow near it. Now this is the Benefit my Reader is expected to reap from the Firſt Book, which, as I ſaid, may furniſh him with ſufficient Inſtructions for the getting throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the World and Himſelf; and this Knowledge will poſſeſs him with ſo juſt a Character of Both, as cannot but aſſiſt and lead him on, to Conſideration and Care, and teach him to ſtand upon his guard, and diligently beware of both. Thus there is a ſtrict and natural Connection between the two parts of this Treatiſe; for the Beginning and Firſt Step of the Second Book, is the End and Fruit of the Former.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let us firſt then ſay ſomewhat to that Hindrance, which is External.<note place="margin">Popular Error.</note> Now we have heretofore given a large and lively Deſcription of the Temper of the Common People; the ſtrange unaccountable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of That,<note place="margin">Book I. Ch LII.</note> which is by much the moſt numerous part of Mankind; and it can be no hard matter to make a Judgment from thence, what monſtrous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thoſe humours muſt in all reaſon be expected to produce. For ſince the Vulgar are ſo bewitched with the love of Vanity, ſince they abound with Envy and Malice; ſince they are ſo totally void of Juſtice, and Judgment, and Diſcretion; ſince they are perfectly ſtrangers to Moderation and good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and what ſort of Deliberations, and Opinions, and Judgments, and Reſolutions, can we ſuppoſe them taken up with? How indeed is it poſſible that they ſhould think, or ſpeak, or act, according to Truth, and good Senſe? We have likewiſe before,<note place="margin">Book I. Ch. xxxix.</note> in that Chapter which undertook to repreſent the Miſery of Human Nature, given ſeveral remarkable, and but too notorious inſtances of the Faults and Failings, which the generality of the World are guilty of, both in point of Judgment and Choice;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53648:302"/>how miſerably their Underſtandings are darken'd, and their Wills depraved; which may very eaſily convince us, how fix'd, and deeply rooted they are in Error and Vice. To this purpoſe are thoſe Sayings common among Wiſe men, That <hi>the Greater part is always the worſe part of Mankind; There is not one of a Thouſand Good:</hi> That <hi>the Number of Fools is infinite.</hi> And that <hi>there is very great Danger of Infection in the Croud.</hi>
                        </p>

So contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the very Breath and Company of the People; ſo little ought even the wiſeſt and perſons beſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Virtue and Wiſdom, to truſt themſelves among them. For who indeed is ſtrong enough to ſuſtain the Attack of Vices, when they march up in form of Battel, and charge by whole Troops at once? We ſee what a world of Miſchief one ſingle Example of Avarice or Luxury does; The Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of One Effeminate Man ſoftens by degrees and enervates the Minds of them that live with him; One Rich Neighbour kindles our Deſires of Wealth; One Lewd Companion ſtrikes as it were his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and Debauchery into us ſo forcibly, that we may even feel the Impreſſion; it eats like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and nothing is ſo ſolid, ſo clean, to be free from the Ruſt of it. And if this be the Caſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances, what do we think muſt the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Power be, of thoſe Vices and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53648:302"/>that are become General, and ſuch as all the world run into with full Cry, and wild Career?</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And yet after all, as neceſſary as this keeping aloof off from Infection is, the thing is exceeding difficult, and but ſeldom put in practice. For to follow the beaten Track is ſomething very plauſible, and carries a great Appearance of Juſtice and Goodneſs, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Condeſcenſion in it. The Road is plain and large, and Travellers are eaſily ſeduced into it. Singularity is a By-path, and none but fanciful or conceited men are thought to take it. We go on after our Leaders, like Beaſts in a Herd: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs, and Worth, and Juſtice of a thing is rarely examined; but Example and Cuſtom are the moving Arguments; and thus we hurry on, and ſtumble at the ſame Stones, and fall upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaps; we preſs and puſh forward, and draw whole multitudes upon the ſame Precipice; and there we fall and periſh, merely upon the Credit of thoſe that go before us. Now the Man that would be wiſe indeed, muſt take quite contrary Meaſures. He muſt receive nothing upon Content and Example on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but be very jealous and conſiderate, and ſuſpect every thing which he finds the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind agreed in, and fond of; and inſtead of count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Numbers, and practiſing by the Poll, he muſt weigh the Goodneſs of the thing; not ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be deluded with fair Appearances, with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Approbations, or common uſe, or doing as the reſt of the world do, but nicely examine the real intrinſick worth of Things and Actions, and reſolve to ſtand alone, where this will not juſtify his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> is a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt, a prudent, a neceſſary Precept; and a moſt vicious and miſtaken Modeſty That is, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with us to diſobey it. When therefore any one would cut us ſhort, and thinks to knock all our Arguments on the head, by ſaying, <hi>All the world is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53648:303"/>of this Opinion, or all the world does thus,</hi> a conſiderate Man will anſwer to himſelf at leaſt, <hi>I like it ſo much the worſe for that; this is but a very ſcurvy Caution,</hi> for <hi>their Approbation makes me ſuſpect it the more.</hi> Thus the Wiſe <hi>Phocion,</hi> when he ſaw the whole Auditory highly applaud ſomething he had ſpoken, turned about, and asked his Friends that ſtood by, What was the matter; whether he had let fall ſomewhat which ought not to have been ſaid, or been guilty of ſome egregious Impertinence, that all the People were ſo mightily pleaſed with him. The wiſeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod then, is to decline, as much as poſſibly we can, any Familiarity or frequent Converſation with the People, who are generally fooliſh, ignorant, and a very odd Medley of Men: But, if our affairs will not permit that, yet at leaſt it muſt be our conſtant Care to avoid their received opinions, not to be born down with their Judgments, nor conform our ſelves to their Temper and Complexion, nor be corrupted by their vicious Diſpoſitions and Practices: But at the ſame time we live in the world, we muſt not be of the world. And This indeed is the Reaſon why Solitude is ſo much and ſo earneſtly recommended by Philoſophers and Wiſe men; a Solitude, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſetting the Soul free, and diſcarding all popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions, and reigning Vices; delivering the Mind from the Bondage and Confuſion, which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and Example, and the Common Cry ſubject it to; that ſo itmay have leiſure to retire into it ſelf, and take its full Range without Interruption or Reſtraint.</p>

And This is that Slavery and Perplexity which our own Paſſions and diſorderly Affections put us into. And againſt Theſe there ought to be a ſtrict and ſtrong guard, to prevent their Tumults
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53648:303"/>and Inſurrections; or rather indeed we ought, if that were poſſible, to diſpoſſeſs them quite, that ſo our Mind might be clean, and open, and unſullied, like a Blank Paper, ready to receive any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, any Tincture of Wiſdom, againſt which the Paſſions are formal and declared Enemies, by the Stains and Prejudices they leave upon it.

Wiſdom is a regular conduct of the Soul; it proceeds in number, and weight, and meaſure; it is an evenneſs and ſmoothneſs, a ſweet and pleaſing Harmony of our Judgments and Wills, and well-proportioned Diſpoſitions. A conſtant health and ſoundneſs of the Mind; whereas the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions quite contrary, are the Ague-ſits of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Soul, the Boundings and Reboundings of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the wild Skips, and wanton Sallies, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Emotions, and raſh unguided Flights of the Man, without any Aim, or Order, or Meaſure.</p>

I do not here reckon that Happineſs of Conſtitution and Natural Bleſſedneſs,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53648:304"/>which renders the Man ſo well tempered, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him calm and ſerene; not ſubject to any ſtrong Paſſions, or violent Emotions of Soul; and keeps him in a conſtant, ſmooth, even, uniform compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Spirit, harden'd and impenetrable, and proof againſt all Attacks. This indeed is an uncommon Excellency; but it is not ſo properly a Remedy againſt Evil, as an Exemption from it; it is not a Medicine or an Inſtrument of Recovery, but it is an effectual Prevention of Sickneſs, and the State of Health it ſelf. This therefore falls not within the compaſs of our Subject and Deſign in this place, which is to preſcribe Remedies truly ſo called; and of Them I ſhall propoſe Four to the Reader's Obſervation.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Firſt, which in truth is not at all adviſable, nor hath any real Goodneſs to recommend it,<note place="margin">Stupidity.</note> is a ſort of Stupidity or Inſenſibility of Mind, which does not feel, nor apprehend at all. A Brutiſh Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, incident to mean Souls, ſuch as are either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſeared and dead, or have their Apprehenſions in great meaſure blunted and dulled; a ſort of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs and Cruſt upon the Senſitive parts; a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lethargy, and conſtant Heavineſs, which though it have ſome Air of Health and Eaſe, yet what we think ſo is in effect its Diſeaſe. For there can be no ſuch thing as Wiſdom and Conſtancy, where there is no Knowledge, no Senſe, no Activity at all. And therefore this does not cure the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but only render the Patient inſenſible of his Illneſs. But yet This, as bad as it is, is better, and much rather to be choſen, than the knowing, and feeling, and ſuffering ones ſelf to be vanquiſhed and preyed upon by the painful Impreſſion: What <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſays of his Writings, is thus far applicable to the Affections and Follies of Mankind;

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The Second Remedy is very little or nothing better than the Diſeaſe it ſelf, and yet it is more uſed, <note place="margin">A Counter-Paſſion.</note> and oftner applied, than any other. This is, when a man vanquiſhes one Paſſion, and ſtifles it by the more prevailing Force of another. For the Paſſions are never equally poized, but one or other of them will always caſt the Scales. Now we are frequently guilty of a great Error, in attributing things to Virtue and Wiſdom, in which They never had the leaſt hand or concern, but they are purely the Effects of Paſſion. And it happens very well for Perſons under theſe Circumſtances, when thoſe which ride higheſt, and have got the Dominion in their Souls, are not of the worſt ſort of Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The Third, which is indeed a Good Remedy, though not the very Beſt,<note place="margin">Prevention.</note> is a matter of Prudence and Artifice, by which a Man ſteals out of the way, runs, hides himſelf, and keeps at a diſtance from the Occaſions and Accidents, which he knows, or hath found by Experience, apt to provoke and put him out of Temper; ſuch as wake the ſleeping Lion, and give Fire to his Paſſions. This is a Study, and a Knack men have of putting themſelves upon a poſture of Defence; or rather of keeping good Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards: upon the alarming whereof they may have leiſure to retreat, or ſo to ſecure the Paſſes and Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, that the Approach of Evils may be intercepted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53648:305"/>and prevented. Of this kind is that common Story of a Prince, who immediately broke a Rich Cup that was preſented to him, for fear it ſhould provoke his Anger, if by Chance or Negligence it ſhould happen to be broken by another hand. The proper and conſtant Prayer of theſe men is, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation.</hi> Thus it is, that Men reſolve againſt Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, who feel themſelves unable to command their Temper, and cannot play without Paſſion. And thus Men of nice Honour, and prone to Anger, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Diſputes in Company, and cruſh the very firſt motions to Strife in the birth. For when a man is once engaged, it is difficult to make a good Retreat; and the After-Game of Wiſdom and Diſcretion is very hard and hazardous to play. In the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we manage things as we pleaſe, and have them at our mercy; but when once the fire is kindled, and we are grown warm, they manage and carry Us how and whither they will. It is certainly much eaſier wholly to decline a Paſſion, than to keep it within juſt bounds and meaſures; and that which few can moderate, almoſt any body may prevent. And the Reaſon is plainly this; Becauſe all things in their infancy and at firſt, are ſmall and feeble, flexible and tender. But the misfortune is, that while they are weak we are not ſenſible of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and when they are grown ſtubborn and ſtrong, we are not capable of a Remedy. This any man may obſerve in common Converſation. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances could every one of my Readers recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of perſons, who upon every ſlight occaſion fall into Quarrels, commence Law-ſuits, engage in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes and Controverſies, and are at laſt forced to give out with Diſgrace; come to ſhameful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Accommodations; take Sanctuary in mean and equivocating Interpretations; belye and contradict themſelves; betray their want of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; go againſt their own Senſe; palliate, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53648:305"/>diſguiſe, and colour over matters of Fact; which are all of them miſerable Refuges, and Remedies ten thouſand times worſe, than the Diſeaſe they would cure? In all theſe caſes it were much better not to begin at all, than to bring matters to ſuch a Concluſion. For, for want of timely Prudence and good Conduct, they fall into want of Integrity and Good Senſe. And ſo in all their Proceedings they run directly counter to that wiſe Advice of <hi>Bias,</hi> which is to ſet out and undertake things coolly and conſiderately; but, when we are well ſatisfied of the Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of our Enterprize, then to proſecute it warmly and vigorouſly. It is in this manner, that thoſe fooliſh Men expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who out of a vicious Eaſineſs and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, are aſhamed to deny any requeſt made to them; but after this mighty Liberality in promiſing, are every whit as apt and eaſy to break their word again, and proſtitute that Honour vilely, which was engaged with ſo much Levity. And therefore in all our Affairs, in all our dealings and Converſation with men, nothing is more requiſite, than to look before us, to make true ſteps at firſt, and be well adviſed, before we begin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The Fourth, and infinitely the Beſt Remedy of all is a ſtanch and Vigorous Virtue;<note place="margin">Virtue.</note> a Reſolution and Firmneſs of Mind, by which a man is qualified to look any Accidents in the Face; to meet and come up cloſe to them, without Starting, or Diſorder, or Confuſion; to enter into the Liſts, and encounter them gallantly. This is a brave, a noble, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impaſſibility indeed; which ſets the Mind above Trouble, directly contrary to the firſt of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which conſiſted in an impenetrable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a heavy, ſottiſh, ſenſleſs Stupidity. And there is nothing will Contribute more to the working us up into this generous Gallantry of Spirit, than the furniſhing and forming our Judgments with good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53648:306"/>Inſtructions; digeſting them thoroughly, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them Seaſonably; but eſpecially the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves with Thought and Deliberation, that ſo we never fall under the Terrors of Surprize; but be prepared to defend our Poſt, whenever they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us. For Reaſoning and Diſcourſe maſters the Paſſions, and Premeditation is the thing, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the Soul, and renders it proof, againſt all the Evils that would ſoften and ſubdue it. And one great help towards the preſerving us impregnable, will be a ſerious Reflection upon what hath already been delivered in the foregoing parts of this Book; For the proper method of calming and ſweetning the Paſſions, is to get well acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them; to examine them nicely, and know exactly, what Influence they have upon Us, and what Command we have over them. But eſpecially we ſhould guard our ſelves againſt too eaſy a Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and not ſuffer any raſh Surmiſe or Opinion, to foment or inflame our Paſſions; for Falſhood, and Folly, and Uncertainty, tranſport Fools only; a Wiſe Man will weigh things calmly, and coolly, and ſuffer himſelf to be carried no farther than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment, and meaſured Truth lead him: For Reaſon is his only Guide, and every Impreſſion is brought to this Standard, and ſtrictly examined by it. But of This, beſides the light given us already, we ſhall be more fully and particularly qualified to make a Judgment, both from what follows in this Second Book, and from the Inſtructions to be added in the Third, when we come to enlarge there upon the Virtues of <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> But above all other Paſſions, That of Self-Love, and Preſumption, and inordinate Fondneſs of our own Imaginations, Opinions, and Actions, requires a ſtrict and watchful Eye, and the ſtrongeſt guard we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſet over it. For this is the very Peſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the moſt mortal and irreconcilable Enemy to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53648:306"/>Wiſdom; the very Corruption and Gangrene of the Soul, by which it mortifies, and grows abſolutely incurable. This ſwells us with vain Conceits, and falſe Satisfactions and Confidences; we make undue eſtimates of our ſelves, and are marvellouſly pleaſed with our own ſuppoſed Sufficiency; nay we perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Idolize, fall down and worſhip our Selves, and neither believe, nor hear, any body but our Selves. Now indeed we can never be in worſe hands than our own, and that Prayer of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is a very ſignificant and ſenſible one, <hi>O God preſerve me from my ſelf.</hi> Such Preſumption and fooliſh Self-Love proceeds from miſtake; and Ignorance, is not ſo truly the Mother of any Devotion, as of this. Were men but duly ſenſible, how weak and wretched, how impotent and little, how full of Infirmities and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Human Nature is in general; and were each Man duly ſo of his own perſonal Defects and Frailties in particular,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.16.</note> that Divine Counſel of <hi>not being wiſe in our own Conceits,</hi> would be much better obeyed: And obeyed it is neceſſary it ſhould be; for till we are free of this Vanity, we can never arrive at true and ſound Wiſdom. It ſtops our Ears againſt all Advice and Inſtruction, and ſuffers us not to ſee our own Wants, nor the Abilities of others to direct and improve us. Honeſty and Integrity, Modeſty and Diligence, a meek and teachable Temper, a ſerious, and hearty, and humble acknowledgment of our Deficiency; Theſe are not only the firſt and ſureſt Steps to Virtue, but the greateſt Evidence of a ſolid Judgment, a clear Underſtanding, a rightly-diſpoſed Will, and unbiaſſed Affections; and conſequently, a moſt hopeful and promiſing, as well as it is an indiſpenſably Requiſite Preparation, to the Study and Attainment of Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>

                        <p>The Former of theſe, which regards the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſts in conſidering, judging, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all things; yet not Tying ones ſelf up to any, but remaining ſtill free, and at ones own diſpoſal; of a large univerſal Spirit, open and ready to hear any thing that ſhall be offered. This is the higheſt pitch of Soul, the moſt peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Priviledge of a truly Great and Wiſe Man; but ſuch a one I confeſs it is, as all People are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding, and much leſs ſtill of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it.

                        <p>Then again, <hi>By not eſpouſing, or being bound up to any thing,</hi> I do not intend ſtopping ſhort of the Truth, affecting Uncertainty, and floating in the Air; ſometimes talking and acting one way, and ſometimes the direct contrary; and ſo never proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reſolving any thing after ſuch Deliberations as are requiſite for a Man of Conſtancy and Prudence, nor venturing to Act, becauſe he cannot be poſitive, that his Judgment is right; For I would have my Philoſopher conform to the Cuſtoms of the World, and in all the external and common Paſſages of Human Life, act like other Men. The Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed here have nothing at all to do with any Man's Commerce or outward Behaviour; their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is only to regulate the Mind; and to ſet the Thoughts and Judgment right within. Nay, and even in this Inward Regulation too, I am content, that Men ſhould readily aſſent to probable Evidence; That they ſhould ſtick to that ſide, where they find the greateſt Appearance, of Honeſty and Juſtice,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53648:308"/>of Convenience and Advantage. But ſtill that This ſhould be done with ſome ſort of Modeſty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; avoiding all Poſitiveneſs, and Stiffneſs; all indecent Cenſures and Contemptuous Uſage of thoſe who think otherwiſe: Treating the Contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, be they never ſo diſtant, be they New, or Old, with Candour and Caution; diſdaining no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be offered, but ready and content to hear the Arguments of thoſe that oppoſe us. Nay, not only content, but deſirous, that they ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us, and alledge whatever they have to ſay againſt our Notions; Becauſe This will put us upon a more Accurate Exerciſe of the Firſt of theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, and oblige us to conſider and weigh things more cautiouſly.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe Three Qualities I affirm to preſerve, and mutually to ſupport each other; For He that examines things carefully and without Paſſion, will find ſomewhat of Reaſon and Probability on every ſide; ſo much at leaſt as will preſerve him, not only from Raſhneſs and Precipitation, but from Perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorineſs and Obſtinacy; and this puts the Mind in that State of Ingenuity, and Indifference, which I mean by Openneſs, and Univerſality of Soul. Whereas on the contrary, the Man who fixes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, hath cut himſelf out from farther Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is faſten'd down to the Notions already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by him; and makes himſelf of a Party, reſolved to maintain his Opinion, in deſpight of all Senſe and Reaſon to the Contrary.</p>
                        <p>Simple and Credulous and Fooliſh Men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the Firſt of theſe Qualifications; Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Dogmatical Arguers are faulty in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Point; and both the one and the other Sort, when they turn factious, and eſpouſe a Party, offend againſt the Third. But a Philoſopher indeed, whoſe only aim is Truth, and whoſe Purſuits of it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and diſcreet, is Wiſe, and Modeſt, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53648:308"/>and ſo an exact Obſerver of all theſe Rules.</p>
                        <p>It is farther neceſſary, for the giving a true State of the Matter I am now upon, to add, that by the <hi>All things</hi> to be nicely examined, and the <hi>No one thing</hi> to be reſolutely eſpouſed, I mean ſuch Objects only, as are merely humane, and Matters proper for a Philoſophical Enquiry. So that This Direction muſt by no means be thought to concern Revealed and Divine Truths. For Theſe we are obliged, not in Duty only, but by the ſtricteſt Reaſon too, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with an entire ſubmiſſion and moſt profound humility. Theſe are not Matters for Diſcuſſion and Controverſy; we have nothing to do here, but to bow down the Head and Worſhip; to reſtrain the Inſolence of Reaſon, when it would ſawcily pry into the Ark; to check and captivate our Minds, and reſign our Underſtandings to the Obedience of Faith. But, theſe Religious and Sacred Objects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, none of the reſt need diſdain to come within thoſe Conditions, and ought not to be received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eaſier terms.</p>
                        <p>This ſhort Exaplanation of the Terms might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuffice for Men of Equity and Good Senſe, and ſave me the Trouble of any farther Enlargement; but becauſe I ſee plainly that there are a Party of Men in the world, of a poſitive, fierce and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Spirit, who are for leading all Mankind after them in a very Magiſterial manner; and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt inviolably engaged in ſome particular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Opinions themſelves, take the Confidence to expect, that every Body elſe ſhould come in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Their Authority; and for that reaſon will not endure any thing that looks like aſſerting Liberty of Thinking; In oppoſition to theſe ſtiff, aſſuming Gentlemen; and to prevent, or at leaſt to defeat their Outcries upon this Occaſion, I think my ſelf under ſome neceſſity to prove, and confirm what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53648:309"/>hath been here advanced; and will therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Branch of this Propoſition diſtinctly, as the parts lye before us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Firſt of Theſe is <hi>Judging every thing;</hi> which is the peculiar Character of the Wiſeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Underſtandings, The proper Office of a Man; the moſt natural, moſt becoming employment of a Rational Soul. To what purpoſe, I would fain know, were thoſe Noble Faculties of Diſcourſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us; why have we that penetrating Wit, that Diſcerning and Acute Spirit? Is it to build Caſtles in the Air with, and feed our ſelves with Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Fancies, or to laviſh it away upon uſeleſs Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Trifles, as the greateſt part of Mankind do? Eyes certainly were made to take Advantage of the Light; and theſe Powers to exert themſelves in that Judicial Authority, which this Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the lower world, hath over the Works of Nature and Providence. To entrench upon this Prerogative, were to maim his very Eſſence; to unman, and to degrade him into Beaſt. And to exerciſe this Right is the Property of a Man, and to do it in an Eminent and Uncommon Manner, is the very Mark and Diſtinction of a Wiſe Man. If then the Neglect of this Power be ſo great a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nature and Privileges of Mankind in general, the giving up an Original Right, which ought not by any means to be parted with; how much more inexcuſable is it in a Wiſe-man, who is ſo much better qualified for it, and hath ſtronger pretenſions to that Authority, than thoſe of meaner Abilities can have? It is therefore, in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, a moſt amazing thing, that ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even among thoſe, who either have, or at leaſt ſet up for Learning and Good Senſe, ſhould of their own accord give up ſo juſt a Right, and tamely ſubmit to what comes next; nay, approve whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath the leaſt Colour of a Probability; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53648:309"/>nothing but Cuſtom and common Credit to keep it in Countenance; without ever going about to call the Cauſe, and examine whether there be any Merits in it or no. Nay, not only to ſubmit, but to think themſelves bound to do ſo; and that they are not at liberty to ſatisfy their own Reaſon. What a Horrible Indignity, what a Degradation of Humane Nature is This? In other Caſes we find them bold and aſſuming, extremely jealous of their Honour, and tenacious of their Privileges: But here they are deſpicably tame, and poor-ſpirited, which is the juſteſt, the moſt indiſputable, the moſt inherent Property of any that belongs to them.</p>
                        <p>'Tis certain, that there can be but One Truth, but Falſhood is infinite: A Thouſand differing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſame Thing, and but One of all theſe in the right; and ſhall I in the midſt of all this Doubt and Confuſion, be forbidden to uſe the Means God hath put into my hands, for the finding out which That is? Shall it be thought Taking more upon me than becomes me, if I endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the beſt Appearance of Truth, or Equity, or Profit, or Convenience, for a Rule and Meaſure to my own Actions? Is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many diſagreeing, nay oppoſite Laws and Cuſtoms of the World, none but Ours ſhould be good for any thing? Are all Mankind out of their Senſes, and hath every other Nation taken wrong Meaſures? Who can have the Confidence to aſſert this? Or who makes any Queſtion, but other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are even with us, and think every whit as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Our Conſtitutions, as we do of Theirs Nay, there is no diſpute, but this very Perſon, whoever he be, that is ſo blindly fond of his Native Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, would have had the ſame partial Liking for thoſe of any other place, where it had been his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have been born and bred: He would have been as warm in preferring Thoſe, above ſuch as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53648:310"/>he now thinks beſt, for no other reaſon 'tis plain, but becauſe he hath been uſed to them.</p>
                        <p>If any Man ſhall venture to aſſert the Contrary, I muſt beg leave at leaſt to anſwer him; that This Liberty of Judging is a good Rule however for all Foreigners to make Uſe of; that ſo They by the Practice of it may convince themſelves, how much Our methods of Living excel Theirs. This he muſt grant me ſure; and if he do, it will follow, that a Wiſe Man will think it adviſable to do this upon All Occaſions; and paſs Sentence upon nothing, till he have allowed it a fair hearing, and weighed the Matter impartially. To be led thus like Oxen, and follow the Herd, is fit for none but Brutes, or Men but one Remove above them. I would by all means have a man behave and expreſs himſelf, and make his Figure in compliance with the reſt of the World; but I would not have him conform his Judgment to Theirs, nay I would have him even ſit in Judgment upon Theirs. What Privilege do you leave the greateſt Philoſopher above the moſt ignorant Clown, if the nobleſt part of him, his Mind, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to common Vogue? Methinks the World ſhould be very well ſatisfied with a Man's Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in outward Behaviour: But all Within is <hi>my Own;</hi> And what hath the World to do with my Thoughts? They ſhall give Rules if they pleaſe to my Tongue, and my Hand; but my Mind, by their good Leave, is out of their Juriſdiction, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to another Maſter. <hi>The Liberty of the Mind</hi> is what no body can actually take away; and if any Attempt it, they are of all Tyrants and Uſurpers, the moſt unreaſonable, the moſt inſupportable. Every Wiſe Man will be ſure to be tender of it, and offend in neither Extreme, for he will neither endure to part with his own Freedom, nor offer to invade any other Man's.</p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53648:310"/>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now I own, that while a Wiſe Man aſſerts this Liberty to himſelf, it cannot be expected, that he ſhould be always of a piece: For at this rate his Hand and his Opinion, his Body and his Mind will be frequently put upon contradictions to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and there is no avoiding it: becauſe Prudence governs his outward Actions, and private Judgment the Sentiments of his Soul. So that here are two different Characters to be maintained, and he muſt play both, or be unjuſt either to the World, or to himſelf. The Common Remark, that all Mankind act a part upon this Stage of the World, is as ſtrictly true of the Wiſeſt Men, as of any others whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: for they are quite other ſort of perſons within than they appear to the Spectators; and if they ſhould not play thus, but ſhew themſelves without any manner of diſguiſe, the difference would never be endured, all their Behaviour would be ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: And yet at the ſame time were their real Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in agreement with their Practice, this would involve them in ſo many Errors and Corruptions, that they would not be able to endure themſelves. Many Compliances muſt be indulged out of Reſpect to the Opinion of the World, and the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, which prevail abroad; and particularly, in the places where we dwell: But then a man owes it to himſelf too, not to make Theſe the Standard of his Opinions, but form Them upon the Dictates of Nature, and the Rules of Univerſal Equity and Reaſon. And he who does thus, muſt content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with many things which he does not ſtrictly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and while he lives among Men, muſt act as They do, but with this Reſerve to himſelf, that theſe things are not done by him, in the Quality of a Wiſe Man, but merely under the general Character of a Man, and a Member of Society. Thus He in his Actions, will be like <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Expreſſions; who declared he referred the Uſage of Words to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53648:311"/>but the proper meaning of them he reſerved the right of judging in to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>To inſtance now in a few particulars; and thoſe ſome of them very frivolous, and of little or no Conſequence. I make no Scruple to pull off my Hat in Civility and Deference to a Man of Quality, becauſe this part of the World expreſs their Reſpect that way; but at the ſame time I am free to think, the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Cuſtom better, who expreſs their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by laying their hand upon their Breaſt; and never hazard their health, nor expoſe themſelves to any of the other Inconveniences incident to frequent Uncovering of the Head. So again, were I an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Oriental parts of the World, I would eat my Meals upon the ground, or leaning, or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along, as they do, and as great part of the World did heretofore, particularly the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we find by the Deſcription of our Lord's laſt Supper; but ſtill I could not forbear in my own private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preferring the ſitting upright at Table, as our preſent manner is, for the much more commodious way of Eating. Again, to mention a Matter of ſomewhat greater Importance, I am ſatisfied, that the Dead Bodies of my Friends ſhould be interred, and given as a Prey to the Worms; but ſtill I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think the old way of burning, and preſerving their Aſhes in Urns, much more cleanly, and more noble; that Fire is more reſpectful than Putrefaction and Stench; an Element, which even Religion hath given ſome Countenance to, by commanding the Remainders of the Paſchal Lamb heretofore to be burnt: But what can we do worſe than to caſt our Friends to rot in the ground, and be eaten by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and Inſects; an Indignity, which to Me ſeems fit to be offered, only to thoſe Scandalous Wretches, who dye by the Hands of Common Executioners; but the Remains of Perſons of Honour and Virtue (in my poor Apprehenſion) ſhould be otherwiſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53648:311"/>For of the five ſeveral ways by which dead Bodies are capable of being diſpoſed of, (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the mercy of the four ſeveral Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ſuffering them to be devoured by Beaſts;) that of Burning ſeems to me much the moſt eligible.</p>
                        <p>Once more. I am well enough pleaſed to have the Wiſe Man of my forming look out of Countenance, and take care to decline and conceal every thing that paſſes for Immodeſt in the Eſteem of the World; and muſt have a very ill Opinion of him, ſhould he do otherwiſe: But then I deſire he ſhould be ſatisfied, that this is due from him in regard to the Cuſtoms and common Sentiments of other people; not to any ſhame in the Nature of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For Nature, that is, the God of Nature, never made any thing which was reproachful, and theſe Ignominies are purely accidental; the product of Sin, which is the Greateſt Enemy and Corrupter of Nature. Even Religion it ſelf, which is much more Chaſte and Reſerv'd than Philoſophy, aſſures us, that while Man continued in his Original Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Perfection, there was no ſuch thing as Shame; but That and Guilt entred the World at once.</p>
                        <p>I comply with the Mode of my own Countrey, in point of Cloaths and Dreſs; and ſo I would have gone Naked too, if my Lot had caſt me in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where it is uſual to do ſo. But to Me both theſe Faſhions appear ſo inconvenient, that, were I left to my own Choice entirely, I ſhould do neither. The manner of thoſe Nations, which uſe ſome One ſlight Garment, plain and light, without Conſtraint, or Ceremony, or Great Expence, is much the beſt in my apprehenſion. For the multitude of Cloaths, and the different Sorts of them, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Vanity and abominable Extravagance the World is guilty of in them, is a thouſand times worſe than going Naked. Theſe Inſtances I content
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53648:312"/>my ſelf with the mention of at preſent; my Reader may multiply them to himſelf at pleaſure, upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the infinite Variety of Laws and Cuſtoms, and Modes, and Matters of Fact; and the as great Variety in Opinions too, and conteſts in Matter of Right, and what is fit to be done, as well as what is actually done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If any ſhall ſuppoſe me in the wrong, as to the foregoing Inſtances, or object againſt this Liberty in general, as an Indulgence of dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; That by this means mens minds will never ſettle, but they will be eternally loſt in a Wood, and fill their heads with idle and phantaſtical Notions: I anſwer, as to the former part, which relates more immediately to my ſelf; that it is very poſſible I may lye under a miſtake in ſome or all of thoſe Caſes; but then it argues great Confidence thus to charge any man with being in the wrong; for ſuch a one does in effect aſſume to himſelf the knowledge of Exact Truth, and ſeems to ſay, that He is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it, though others be not. Nor ſhould I much be mortified, though the Charge were true: for the not hitting upon the Right, is no certain Argument, that a man judges amiſs. For This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in not giving Arguments their due weight, not confronting them fairly, nor holding the Scales even; not meaſuring by the Level and Standard of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reaſon, and Nature in her primitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Now a man may diſcharge the examining part very faithfully and diligently, and yet he may not attain to the Truth notwithſtanding. But, to deal plainly, I give no Credit to any thing till it be proved to me. If the Objector brings me ſtronger and more weighty Reaſons againſt my Opinion, than any I have to urge in defence of it, I bid him heartily welcome; and ſhall thank him for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which his Contradiction gives me, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this Judicial Authority with ſo much greater
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53648:312"/>accuracy. I only take up with my preſent Thoughts, till better Information give me Cauſe to change them; and therefore they are only upon good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; ready to be diſmiſſed, when more rational ones may ſucceed in their ſtead.</p>
                        <p>But, as to the more general part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which regards the dangerous Conſequences and pernicious Effects of ſuch a Liberty; beſides what hath been urged already, and will be more at large hereafter, (That the Rule, by which our Judgments are to be directed, is Nature and Univerſal Reaſon, which ſo long as we keep cloſe to, we are ſecure from Error:) the Second Branch of this Judicious Liberty, will provide us with Remedies againſt this ſuppoſed Miſchief; and That is what I ſhall now apply my ſelf to treat of particularly and fully.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Other branch then of this Abſolute Liberty of Soul, conſiſts in a ſort of Indifference, and a Suſpending one's Judgment and Final Reſolution. By This the Wiſe Man preſerves his Temper; his Affections are not engaged, and ſo he can conſider every thing without Heat or Paſſion: He is not at all provoked by Oppoſition, not ſtaked down to any one Notion; but keeps an Ear always open for the Contrary Party, and is ready to receive either the Truth, or that which ſeems to make a nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and carry greater Reſemblance to it, than the Ideas he hath entertain'd already. When he ſeems moſt determined, his ſecret Senſe goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than <hi>This is my preſent Opinion;</hi> and <hi>I have reaſon to embrace it above any other:</hi> but ſtill he can hear it contradicted without any Diſorder, and ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to know all that can be ſaid againſt it; and if what is offered preponderates, he makes no ſcruple to change his Mind; and conſtantly, even of That Opinion which ſtuck laſt by him, he goes no farther in vindication, than that poſſibly there may be ſome other better grounded, but this is the Beſt that he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53648:313"/>hath met with. Now this Suſpenſion and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I ſpeak of, is built upon ſeveral famous Maxims entertained and propagated by the Greateſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and likewiſe upon the Freedom they uſed in their Writings and Behaviour. For this Quality muſt be confeſs'd to have been the concurrent Practice, and avowed Principle of Wiſe Men in all Ages; the Moſt, and moſt conſpicuous among them have made no ſcruple openly to confeſs their Ignorance, and their Doubts; ſaying, <hi>That all Nature was full of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Dilemma's;</hi> That <hi>nothing was more certain than Uncertainty;</hi> That <hi>there was ſcarce any thing ſo plain, but an Ingenious Man might bring plauſible and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal Arguments for Either ſide of the Queſtion;</hi> and a thouſand other ſuch Sayings; by which they remarkably argued a diſtruſt of their own Judgments. The reſt of them, though upon ſome occaſions they have proceeded ſomewhat dogmatically, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Minds boldly and poſitively; yet ſeem rather to have diſſembled their Doubts, than not to have had any; and to put the beſt face they could upon the matter, that the World might ſee how far their Wit would carry them, in the Search of Truth; a Thing<note n="*" place="bottom">Quam Docti fingunt, magis quàm nôrunt.</note> 
                           <hi>which Learned Men ſeem rather to have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Idea of to themſelves, than to have known her as ſhe is.</hi> For after all their boaſts of attaining her, their Courage fails them at laſt, and the Things ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by them they dare not venture to beſtow any more honourable Titles upon, than that of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and Appearances of Truth; and while they repreſent them variouſly, ſometimes in one proſpect, and form; and ſometimes in another; by Queſtions, and Problems, and Ambiguous Diſputes; as if their deſign was rather to enquire, than to teach; and that they ſought Information themſelves, while they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53648:313"/>pretend to give it to others; from all this I ſay, and the whole current of their Style, we may reaſonably gather, that they wrote and ſpoke, not ſo much with a deſign to eſtabliſh a Notion, or render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, as for Diverſion, and to Exerciſe their Wits; as one ſays, We cannot be ſure what their opinions were, or that they really believed their own Writings, for indeed<note n="*" place="bottom">No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53648:314"/>more poſitive and magiſterial way of Writing, and from thence got the Title of Dogmatiſts, were Men of a Pedantick, and preſumptuous Temper. They, it is true, condemn and deteſt this Rule of Wiſdom; and were fonder of a Hot-headed peremptory Fellow, though contrary to their own Party and Judgment; than of a peaceable, ſedate. and modeſt Man, who contents himſelf with Doubting, and declines the pronouncing any thing definitively; that is, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they eſteem a raſh Fool, more than a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Wiſe Man. (Like Women, who take it ill not to be contradicted, and had rather be anſwered rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than not at all. Becauſe they think the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indifference of Silence argues greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Diſdain, than it is poſſible for the moſt injurious Language to expreſs.) In which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray great perverſeneſs and injuſtice. For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given, why a Man ſhould not be allowed to ſuſpend his Judgment, and ſtill to deliberate upon things as Doubtful, without venturing to affirm on either ſide; when They at the ſame time take a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of determining as They ſee fit? Is not there the ſame Equity at leaſt, the ſame Right for the one, as for the other? and what mighty Crime is it frankly to confeſs one's ſelf Ignorant, when he is really ſo; and to ſay nothing, when he cannot ſpeak with good Aſſurance, and full Satisfaction?</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that all Philoſophers are agreed ſo much to our diſadvantage, as to pronounce, that we are Ignorant of a great deal more than we know; nay, that our Knowledge is not comparable, not fit to be mentioned in competition with our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The Cauſes of which are infinite; for we may be miſtaken in the Objects of our Enquiry, by reaſon of their being too near or too diſtant; too great or too ſmall; of too long, or too ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in perpetual Flux and Uncertainty. Theſe Cauſes of Error proceed from the Object,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53648:314"/>but then there are infinite Others owing to our Selves, and our Manner of Perception; which in truth is not yet univerſally agreed upon, nor perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well underſtood. What we think our ſelves ſure of we do not really know, nor can we be ſecure of continuing in our preſent Opinion any time. For how often do we ſee freſh Arguments extort it from us? or, if our Obſtinacy will hold it faſt, in deſpight of all Reaſons to the Contrary; yet at leaſt they raiſe a duſt, and diſturb us in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Now I would be glad to know, which way a man ſhall ever be capable of improving his Judgment, if he faſten himſelf down to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notions; reſolving to look and examine no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor enduring to hear any thing offered in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of an Opinion, which he fancieth himſelf abundantly ſatisfied in already. The plain Truth is; Men are aſham'd of this Suſpenſe I am treating of, becauſe they have a wrong Notion of it. They look upon it as a Sign of Want of Judgment; whereas in reality the Greateſt and moſt judicious Philoſophers that ever lived, were the moſt frank in this Point. The Idea of Poſitiveneſs and Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath taken ſuch faſt hold of them, and they think Dogmaticalneſs and Learning ſo inſeparable, that they are out of Countenance in any caſe to own their Ignorance, leſt This ſhould be thought a Reflection upon their Parts and Attainments. There is no perſuading them, that there is a ſort of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Doubt, more Learned, more Generous; and conſiſtent with better Aſſurance, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Knowledge, than all Their boaſted Science and Certainty. This gave that great renown to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and entitled him to the Character of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Man of his Age: This is the Fruit of Study, and deep enquiry; it is a modeſt, candid, innocent, and hearty acknowledgement, of the ſublime myſterious Nature of Truth; and the Defects and Poverty of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53648:315"/>our own Underſtanding; ſo weak within, ſo beſet with Miſts and Darkneſs without, and from Both ſo uncertain, and unſteady in its Reſolutions. <hi>The Lord knoweth the Thoughts of Man, that they are but vain,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt:</hi> And another Author, that,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cogitationes mortalium timidae, incertae adinventiones noſtrae &amp; Providentiae.</note> 
                           <hi>The thoughts of Mortal Men are full of Fears and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings; their Inventions uncertain, and all their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts Dark and Confuſed.</hi> And I, for my own part am ſo fully poſſeſs'd of this Truth, that I have order'd this Motto, <hi>I know not: Je ne ſcay;</hi> to be engraved over the Gate of my little Houſe which I built at <hi>Condom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now there are a ſort of Perſons, who take it ill, that Men ſhould not ſubmit themſelves abſolutely, and fix on ſome certain Principles; which ought, they tell you, never to be examined or controverted at all. Now I allow, that if Theſe be ſuch as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt themſelves to a Man's Reaſon, they ought to be received; but that merely upon the account of their Reaſonableneſs, and not for the pompous Name of Principles. To impoſe any thing unconditionally, is Tyranny and Uſurpation; and though upon due Conſideration, and the Approbation of my own Judgment, I allow them, yet if they will not admit me to try whether they be <hi>Sterling</hi> or <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take them for current Coin; this is a Condition full of Hardſhip and ſuch as I can never yield to. For who, I would fain know, hath power to give Law to our Thoughts, to enſlave our Minds, and ſet up Principles, which it ſhall not be lawful to enquire into; or admit any manner of doubt concerning them? I can own no ſuch Power in any but God; and He hath it upon the account of his being Truth it ſelf; the Supreme Spirit, and the only Principle
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53648:315"/>and Source of all things: which makes it as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe Him upon his bare word, as it is, not to believe other people barely upon Theirs. For this Foundation of our Belief being One of his Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Perfections, it will unavoidably follow, that no other thing is injured or diſparaged, by out refuſing the ſame entire Reſignation to it, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging our Right of Examining, before we yield our Aſſent.</p>
                        <p>If a Man requires my Belief to what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtiled by the Name of Principles, my Anſwer ſhall be the ſame with that of a late Prince to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects in his Kingdom, <hi>Agree among your ſelves firſt, and then I will give my Conſent too.</hi> Now the Controverſies are really as great about theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as they are concerning the Concluſions advanced upon them; as many doubts upon the Generals as the Particulars; ſo that in the midſt of ſo many contending Parties, there is no coming in to any One, without giving offence, and proclaiming War upon all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>They tell us farther, that it is a horrid uneaſy ſtate of Mind, to be always thus upon the Float; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coming to any ſetled Reſolution, to live in Eternal Doubt and Perplexity of Thought; nay, that it is not only painful, but very difficult, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impracticable, to continue long in ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. They ſpeak this, I ſuppoſe, from their own Experience; and tell us what they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But this is an Uneaſineſs peculiar to fooliſh and weak people. To the Former, becauſe Fools are preſumptuous, and paſſionate, and Violent eſpouſers of Parties and Opinions; full of Prejudices, and ſtrong Poſſeſſions; fierce Condemners of all that differ from them; never yielding the Cauſe, nor giving out the Diſpute, though they be really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and ſupplying the want of Reaſon by Heat and Anger, inſtead of ingenuous Acknowledgments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53648:316"/>of their Error. If they find themſelves obliged to change their Opinion, you have them then as peremptory and furious in their new Choice, as ever they were in their firſt Principles; in ſhort, They know not what it is to maintain an Argument, without Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when they diſpute, it is not for the ſake of Truth or Improvement, but purely for Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the Laſt Word, and to aſſert their own Notions. Theſe Men I make no Scruple to call Fools; for in truth they know nothing; not ſo much as what it is <hi>to know;</hi> ſo exceeding pert and confident are they; and inſult as if they carried Truth about in their <hi>Pockets,</hi> and it was their own incommunicable Property.</p>
                        <p>As for Men of Weak Judgments, and ſuch as are not able to ſtand upon their own Legs; it is very neceſſary they ſhould not be left alone, but ſeek a Support from perſons of better and more diſcerning Abilities: But Theſe are not concerned in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rule; it is their Misfortune to be born to Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and out of all Capacity to enjoy the Freedom I am treating of.</p>
                        <p>But as for Wiſe Men, who are qualified for it, Men of Modeſty and Reſerve, and prudent Candor, It is the moſt compoſed State of Mind that can be; and puts us into a Condition of Firmneſs, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of Stable and Uninterrupted Happineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoe liberiores &amp; ſolutiores ſumus, quia integra nobis judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi poteſtas manet.</note> 
                           <hi>We are ſo much leſs under Conſtraint than other Men, by how much more our Minds enlarge themſelves, and the Liberty of judging is preſerved entire.</hi> This is a ſafe courſe to ſteer, and keeps us off from many dangerous Rocks and Shelves; which Warmth, and Raſhneſs, and a Poſitive conceited Humour Drives Men upon. It delivers us from the vain prepoſſeſſions of Fancy,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53648:316"/>and Popular Miſtakes; from the Precipitation of thinking wrong at firſt, and the Shame of retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we come to think better afterwards; from Quarrels and Diſputes, and engaging in, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming offenſive to Parties: For, take which ſide you pleaſe, you are ſure to have a great many againſt you; And a Zealous Eſpouſer of any Cauſe muſt unavoidably live in a conſtant State of Wrangling and War. In a Word, This Suſpenſion of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment keeps us ſnug and under a Covert, where the Inconveniences and Calamities which affect the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick will ſeldom ſenſibly affect, and ſcarce can ever involve us; At a diſtance from thoſe Vices and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Agitations, which ruffle and diſcompoſe firſt Men's own Minds, and then Human Society in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

Theſe are all of the ſame lineage and deſcent. Theſe are begun, fomented, inflamed by your Hot, and Poſitive, and Opinionative Men; not by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and Doubting Men, who are cautious and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, never Over-confident of themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to believe, that others are at leaſt in a poſſibility of being in the right; all which are but ſo many other Names for Wife, and well-temper'd Men.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I will advance yet one Step farther, and venture to affirm, that the Temper of Mind I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending, is ſo far from having any ill Influence upon Piety, and Religion, that it is extremely well calculated to ſerve and promote it; whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the firſt Propagation among Unbelievers, or Preſerving a due Reverence of it, where it is already received. Divinity, and eſpecially that part of it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53648:317"/>which is Myſterious and Revealed, tells us plainly, that the Mind muſt be cleanſed and purified, in order to receive thoſe Heavenly Truths, and the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Spirit. That God will not inhabit our Souls, till all Corrupt Opinions as well as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are caſt out; for, with regard to both, we ſhall do well to underſtand thoſe Commands of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging away the old Leaven,</hi> and <hi>putting off the Old Man.</hi> From whence we may collect, that the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and ſucceſsful method of planting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion among Infidels, would be firſt to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in the Belief of theſe following Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <q>That all the Knowledge of this World hath a large embaſement of Vanity and Falſhood at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it: That the Generality of Mankind are deluded with fantaſtical Notions, the Forgeries of their own Brain: That God created Man to the End he might acquaint himſelf with the Divine Nature and Diſpenſations, and employ his Soul, and ſind his Happineſs in theſe noble Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But that, in this decayed and declining State, Man is not capable of diſcovering Truth by his own Strength: That there is conſequently a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of God (who is Truth) manifeſting it to him: That God hath in much Mercy vouchſafed to do this by particular Revelations: That it is He who inſpires Men with a Deſire of Truth, as well as he provides for the Gratifying that Deſire: That in order to diſpoſe and qualify our ſelves for being inſtructed in the Divine Revelations, we muſt abandon all worldly and carnal Opinions, and as it were, bring our Minds, a pure blank for God to write his Will in.</q> When theſe Points are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Men are in ſuch preparation to reſign themſelves to Truth, then it will be time to lay the foundations, and inſtil ſome of the firſt and plaineſt Principles of Chriſtianity: To ſhew them, <q>That theſe Doctrines came down from Heaven: That
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53648:317"/>the Perſon, who vouchſafed to bring them was a faithful Ambaſſador, and entire Confident of God: One who knew his whole Will exactly: That his Authority was abundantly confirmed, by infinite Teſtimonies, ſuch as were miraculous, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and ſo authentick proofs, becauſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of coming from no other Hand but God's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q> Thus this Innocent and candid Suſpenſe and Unreſolvedneſs of Mind, would prove a happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument toward the creating, and firſt begetting a Knowledge and Belief of the Truth where it is not: Nor would the Eſſicacy of it be leſs in preſerving it, where it is planted, and hath taken root already. For ſuch a Modeſt Caution and Deference would undoubtedly prevent all manner of Singularity, and Daring Extravagance in Opinions; but to be ſure, it would abſolutely put a Stop to Hereſies and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diviſions. You will anſwer me perhaps, that the Temper I am deſcribing, As it is too full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to make any Hereticks, So is it too, to make any good Catholicks; and that the Danger of it is, At laſt degenerating into Scepticiſm, and want of Zeal for all Religions. Were the Condition of Religion the ſame in all points with That of other Notions, and Philoſophy in general, I allow there would be force in this Objection. But as it is, this is not to argue from my Rules, but to pervert them. I have already ſaid, That Religion ſtands upon a firm undoubted bottom of its own. That God in this differs from all his Creatures; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He ſays is exempted from the Common Rules of Enquiry; and there can but one Queſtion lye before us, which is, Whether he hath ſaid it or no: When once this appears to us, there is no room for ſuſpending our Judgments any longer; no pretence for Neutrality, or Liberty of Thought, nor a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning <hi>How theſe things can be? God cannot lye,</hi> and we cannot err in believing Him; but for all things
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53648:318"/>elſe, the more cautious and curious, and the more looſe and diſengaged we keep our Mind with regard to Them, the Safer and Eaſier we ſhall be. I have made a ſort of Digreſſion here, in Honour of the Rule I am recommending, that thoſe who profeſs themſelves Enemies to it may find their great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection obviated. In which, if I have treſpaſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Reader's Patience, I ask his pardon: And now to our Buſineſs again.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53648:318"/>For Nature hath formed him to this very purpoſe, that he ſhould emulate the Gods, and like Them fill his own Infinite Space.</hi> This I confeſs is a ſort of Stoical Rant: But thus much is ſtrictly true; That the Braveſt, and moſt capacious Souls are always moſt of this Univerſal Temper; as on the Contrary, the meaneſt and moſt incapable, are moſt cramped, have the narroweſt Notions; and are always particular in their Judgments of Men and Things, apteſt to be poſitive themſelves, and to condemn all that diſſent from them. It is in Truth great Folly and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to imagine that all Nations are bound to think and act juſt as we do; and, that none live as they ought, who do not comply, and agree in every point with what obtains in our own little Village or our Native Countrey: to think, that the Accidents which happen to Us, are general and in common, and muſt needs affect and extend to the whole World equally. This Senſleſs Wretch, when you tell him of Opinions, and Cuſtoms, and Laws, directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to thoſe he hath been bred up in; without more ado, condemns and expreſſes the greateſt Deteſtation of them imaginable, and rails at the people, as Rude and Uncivilized; or elſe he gives no credit to theſe accounts, but looks upon them, as the Romantick Tales of Travellers, who take liberties of repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foreigners very oddly to thoſe that cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; ſo abſolutely enſlaved are his Judgment and Aſſections to his own Municipal Conſtitutions; ſo impoſſible is it, as he thinks, that any but Theſe ſhould be true, or agreeable to Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is verily perſuaded they muſt needs, or at leaſt ſhould be Univerſal too.

The juſt Idea of Nature is to conſider her, as the Common Mother of us all; an Univerſal Queen, whoſe Authority and Dominion hath the ſame limits with the World, (nay, extends to more Worlds, if (as ſome eminent perſons have thought) more Worlds there be). This would inſpire us with becoming and Great Apprehenſions of her Majeſty, and Beauty; There we ſhould behold, as in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite painting, a conſtant and endleſs variety of Things, and the longer we gazed, the more our Entertainment and our wonder would be. Infinite Difference in Humours, diſagreeing Judgments, Opinions, Cuſtoms and Laws; Innumerable Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Commotions, and Alterations in States and Kingdoms; ſurprizing turns of Fortune in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of private Men; a World of Victories and Triumphs buried and loſt in the Rubbiſh of Time; many Noble Entries and Proceſſions, Pomps, and Grandeurs utterly vaniſhed; and as if the Courts and Princes celebrated by them had never been at all.

The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> his time, as He and <hi>Cicero</hi> both ſay, kept a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter and Annals, comprehending the Space of Four
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53648:320"/>hundred thouſand years. <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Sais</hi> had Memorials in Manuſcript of Eight thouſand years ſtanding; and yet they owned, that the City of <hi>Athens</hi> was built a thouſand years before that of <hi>Sais. Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others, pretend that <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> lived Six thouſand years, before <hi>Plato</hi> was born: Some have advanced a Notion of the World's Exiſting from all Eternity, that it hath been deſtroyed and revived again ſeveral times, and hath, and will for ever hereafter, go through many ſuch Viciſſitudes. Others and Thoſe ſome of the moſt renowned Philoſophers, have held the World to be a God; but yet of ſo inferior a Quality, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Form and preſent Being from another, and much greater God; or elſe, as <hi>Plato,</hi> and ſome others have been induced by the Motions of it, to affirm, with ſome degree of Confidence, that it is certainly an Animal, conſiſting of Body and Spirit: That the Soul or Spirit is lodged in the Centre of the Univerſe; but though its chief Reſidence be there, yet it expands it ſelf all over, to the very utmoſt parts of the Circumference, and that its Influences are conveyed and communicated in Muſical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: That the ſeveral parts of it too, thus animated and directed, as the Heaven and the Stars for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, are made up of a Body and Soul; and theſe, though Mortal in reſpect of their compounded Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are yet Immortal by the determination of their Almighty Creator. <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, That the World puts on quite another face; that the whole Scene is ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the Heaven and Stars vary ſo much in their motions, as quite to change ſides; ſo that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall be Behind, and the Point which is <hi>Eaſt</hi> at one time, comes to be the <hi>Weſt</hi> at another. There hath alſo been an Opinion of great Authority, much countenanced and promoted by the moſt eminent Philoſophers, ſuitable to the Power and Majeſty of God; and grounded upon fair and probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53648:320"/>that there is a Plurality of Worlds; for we ſee no other thing ſingle or ſolitary but This, if This be ſo; All Species are multiplied in numbers, and therefore it is not unlikely, that God hath not left this part of his Workmanſhip quite deſolate and alone; nor exhauſted his whole power and skill in the forming of an Individual. Nay, even Divinity aſſures us, that God can make as many Worlds as he pleaſes; for upon a Suppoſition of the Contrary, we muſt affirm his Power to be but finite, becauſe this World is ſo. And That were a Notion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the abſolute Perfection of his Nature.

If any man ſhall take the Confidence to be poſitive in this point, I ſhall take my liberty in believing him. Secondly, We find the <hi>Zones,</hi> which were look'd on as uninhabitable, are very plentifully peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. Thirdly, We find by experience, that the things which we profeſs to value our ſelves moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and pretend to have had the earlieſt Intelligence of, have been received and practiſed in theſe lately-diſcovered Countries for a long time, and perhaps as ſoon and as long as we our ſelves have obſerved, or had notice of them. I do not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whence they had it. And that, whether we regard Religious Matters, and ſuch as come to us by Revelation from Heaven; as for Inſtance, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of One Single Man at firſt, the Univerſal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor of all Mankind; the Univerſal Deluge; of a God that lived in human fleſh, and took the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a pure and holy Virgin; of a Day of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment; of the Reſurrection of the Dead; the Obſervation of Solemn Faſts; the Ornaments of thoſe that miniſter in Holy things; the Surplice and the Mitre particularly; the Reſpect paid to the Croſs; Circumciſion like that of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi> and Counter-Circumciſion, which makes it a point of Religion, to prevent all appearance of any ſuch thing upon their Bodies: Or, whether we regard Civil Conſtitutions; as That of the Eldeſt Son inheriting his Father's Eſtate; Patent Honours taking new Names, and Titles, and laying down that of their Families; Subſidies to Princes; Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Fortifications: Diverſions of Players and Mountebanks; Muſical Inſtruments, and all kinds of Diverſion, in uſe in theſe parts of the World; Artillery, and Printing. From all which it is very natural to deduce theſe following Inferences. That this huge Body, which we call the World, is very
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53648:321"/>different from the common Apprehenſions of Men concerning it. That it is not at all times, and in all places the ſame; but hath its Tides, its Ebbings and Flowings in perpetual Succeſſion: That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo confidently aſſerted and believed in one place, but is as generally received, as peremptorily maintained, nay, as fiercely contradicted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in another. And that the Original of all this, whether Agreement, or Difference, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve at laſt into the Nature of Man's Mind, which is ſuſceptible of Ideas of all ſorts: And that the World being in perpetual Motion, is ſometimes at greater, and ſometimes in leſs Agreement with it ſelf, in the ſeveral parts of it. That all things are comprehended within the general Courſe of Nature, and ſubject to the Great Director of Univerſal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that they ſpring up, are alter'd, decay, and are aboliſhed, according as He in his Wiſdom thinks fit to vary them, by the Change put upon Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Ages, Countries and Places, the Air, the Climate, the Soil, in which Men are born, and bred, and dwell. And laſtly, That, as our Predeceſſors were but Men, ſo We are no more; and ſince the Errors in Their Judgment of Things are manifeſt, this ſhould teach Us to diſtruſt and ſuſpect our own. And when Theſe Inferences are juſtly made, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of them muſt needs be, to be inſeparably wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to no Opinion, to eſpouſe none of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Speculations too eagerly; to be aſtoniſhed at nothing, though never ſo unuſual; not to loſe our Temper upon any Accident; But whatever happens, or how violent ſoever the Storm may be, to ſix upon this Reſolution, and ſatisfy our ſelves in it; That it is but according to the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that He who governs the World works as he pleaſes; and proceeds by the Rules of his own Wiſdom; and therefore all we have to do, is to take a prudent Care, that nothing may hurt us
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53648:322"/>through our own Weakneſs, or Inconſideration, or Dejection of Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Thus much I thought ſufficient and indeed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſaid upon this perfect Liberty of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſting of the Three Particulars ſo largely inſiſted on. And indeed ſo largely, by reaſon I am ſenſible, it is not ſuited to the Palate of the World; but denounces War againſt Pedants, and poſitive Pretenders; which are all of them Enemies to true Wiſdom, as well as to this Principle of Mine. The Advantages whereof have been ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented already, the Miſchiefs it prevents, and the Tranquillity it brings. This was the particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that Father and Chief of the Philoſophers, and univerſally acknowledged as ſuch: By This, (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays,) though he had no Off-ſpring of his own, yet he managed others ſo, as to make Them fruitful, and Midwif'd their Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the World. This Temper is in ſome ſenſe like that <hi>Ataraxie,</hi> which <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s Sceptical Followers called the Supreme Happineſs of Man: But if that reſemblance be a little over-ſtrained, yet it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well bear being compared to the Neutrality and Indifference, which the Sect of the Academicks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. And the Natural Effect of ſuch a Temper is to be diſcompoſed or aſtoniſhed at nothing; which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> thought the Sovereign Good, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called the True Greatneſs of Soul.

Now here I think it neceſſary to admoniſh my Reader, that the Matter under our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is not that Faculty and Privilege of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, which Philoſophers and Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtile Free-Will, nor ſhall we treat of it in the ſame Method with Them: But my meaning is, That a Wiſe Man ought to preſerve his own Eaſe and Quiet, to keep his Will and Affections free and diſengaged; and to lay them out upon very few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and thoſe ſuch as may juſtify his Choice; (For indeed the things that deſerve our Choice and challenge our Affections, if nicely examined, will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53648:323"/>be found but very few.) But this is not all; For even Thoſe, that deſerve them beſt, will not juſtify our Vehemence, and Eagerneſs, and immoderate Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. And here I find my ſelf under ſome neceſſity of encountring two very popular and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Opinions. The One is That which teaches us to be always forward to ſerve other people; to lay aſide all thoughts of one's ſelf, for the ſake of our Neighbours; and eſpecially, when the Publick Good is concerned, pretends that no private Intereſt ought to come in Competition with it; And the Other prompts us to eſpouſe ſuch Matters with all poſſible Zeal, and to the very utmoſt of our power. He that declines the Former, is accuſed of wanting Good nature, and a publick Spirit; and He that is remiſs in the Latter, is ſuſpected of Coldneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; want of Generoſity, and the Zeal that is required of a Good Man, and in ſhort, reputed incapable of making a Friend. Now whatever there may really be at the bottom of theſe Opinions, yet it is plain, the World have overloaded the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and built ſuch Notions upon it, as exceed all Reaſon and Meaſure; and nothing can be more Romantick and Extravagant, than what we ſind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon theſe Occaſions. For our Governors, who feel the Advantage of them, oftentimes infuſe Principles into us, not according to the true merits of the Cauſe, but in proportion as they perceive they may prove ſerviceable and beneficial: And it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently falls out, that thoſe Opinions, which are in themſelves moſt reaſonable and true, are not moſt convenient to be generally entertained. And beſides this, Obſerving how natural the Love of our Selves and our own private Advantage is, and what Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and unreaſonable Exceſſes it is apt to carry us into, they thought it neceſſary to divert and draw us off as far from This as poſſibly; and ſo took the Common Courſe of bending the Crooked Stick the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53648:323"/>Contrary way, that it might at laſt ſtand ſtrait by being forced toward the other Extreme.</p>

As we may plainly obſerve in thoſe perſons, that ſnap at every bait of this kind; let themſelves out to hire as it were; and devote all their Time and Pains to the ſervice of other people. Theſe men do not only ſuffer themſelves to be managed, and taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Poſſeſſion of by their Friends; but they thruſt themſelves forward of their own accord, and will have an Oar in every Boat: It is indifferent to Them, whether the Matter concerns them, or not; whether it be of greater conſequence, or of none at all; ſtill they Intereſs themſelves in all alike; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they often do it merely to keep themſelves in Motion and Employment; It ſtirs their Spirits, put their Soul into a pleaſing ſort of Agitation; and thus<note n="*" place="bottom">In Negotio ſunt negotij causà.</note> 
                           <hi>they are buſy purely becauſe they love to be ſo.</hi> They cannot bear the having nothing to do; nor can they confine their Thoughts to their own Affairs; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do not ſee, or careleſly overlook them: and ſo ſeek Employment abroad, and meddle and turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers in things that are foreign and diſtant, as if they had nothing at all to do at home; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns that are eſſential and neceſſary to be followed; no perſonal, no domeſtick Cares, that lye upon their hands; ſuch as ought to be firſt diſpatched; and which, if duly attended to, would leave no room for Sloth, nor leiſure ſo great, as ſhould prove a Temptation to us, to turn Managers for other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we may keep our ſelves in Action. Many
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53648:324"/>of theſe perſons are good husbands of their purſe, and careful not to part with a Penny of Money, but upon valuable conſiderations; but they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably prodigal of their Soul, their Life; ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away their Time and their Pains, their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and their Will, moſt profuſely and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; dedicate Themſelves and all their Powers, to any occaſions that calls for their Aſſiſtance; And yet when all is done, Theſe are the valuable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, of which we ought to be exceeding choice and ſparing; and in ſuch Inſtances it is chiefly, that Frugality and good Management are commendable. But alas! the Perſons we ſpeak of are ſo far from this, that they glory in their Extravagance; act all with ſuch Violence, and Paſſion, that they are loſt to Reaſon and common Senſe; and never think they do enough, till they have engaged as deep as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and given up their Perſons, and their Wits both, to the Cauſe they eſpouſe. Great Men make their Advantage of ſuch Tempers as theſe; Men that will be eager, and angry, and expoſe, nay loſe their lives upon pretences of Friendſhip, and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio's of Honour and Reſpect, are ſpecial Tools for Their purpoſe. And they are not wanting to countenance and careſs them, throw out large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and uſe a thouſand little Stratagems to draw them in, and ſix them to their Party; But though Fools believe and are caught by them, yet Wiſe Men know this is all Trick and Deſign; that there is Deceit in the Bait, and Death upon the Hook; and that all their fair Carriage and large Promiſes are deſigned not at all to ſerve Us, but to ſerve themſelves of us.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Now, Firſt of all, This Temper we have been deſcribing, puts all into confuſion, expoſes the Mind to perpetual uneaſineſs, and brings it into a State of abſolute Slavery. It argues Ignorance of that, which every one ought to know, and that is, how much
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53648:324"/>he owes to himſelf, and what the Obligations are, and the Offices ariſing from them, which are firſt and ſtrictly due at home. All which theſe perſons violate; for while they are ſo mighty officious, and liberal in the ſervice of other people, they injure and defraud themſelves; and ſpend that Stock of Eaſe and Comfort, which is their own due, and ought to be preſerved. Beſides; if we deſire Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Providence hath cut us out enough of our own; let us but look at home, and diſcharge the Duty of our reſpective Stations diligently; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, let us but look within; and we ſhall be far from finding any occaſion to ask for work of our Neighbours: The difficulty will then be to diſpatch that which they ask of Us; and inſtead of laying our ſelves out upon every bodies buſineſs beſides, we ſhall then find our hands Full, and a neceſſity of keeping cloſe to our own. He that takes care to live as becomes his Virtue and his Honour; ſo as may preſerve his health, and give him a contented and cheerful Enjoyment of the World, hath enough to do; and He that neglects or impairs any of theſe, merely to do another ſervice, is ill adviſed; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Good-nature to his Friend, is guilty of great Injuſtice and Ill-nature to himſelf. To oblige and aſſiſt others, ſo far as may be conſiſtent with the ſecuring theſe things to our ſelves, is ſufficient; but to go beyond that, is to break our Duty in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, while we ſupererogate in another. He is an unreaſonable Man, that expects one ſhould ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his Virtue, or his Happineſs to him; and He is a very fooliſh Man, that will do it, if it be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore I repeat again a Direction given juſt now, That a Man ought to eſpouſe and devote himſelf to but very few things; and to take care that theſe be ſuch, as will juſtify the ſetting his heart upon them; and They, to be ſure, can be but very few.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> This leads us to a Third Remark of very great Conſequence, which is, that this vehement and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Zeal infects the Mind, and corrupts the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For while Men are addicted to one Perſon or Party, and wholly ſet upon promoting Their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they go furiouſly to work, and ſtrain eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing beyond its due pitch. They extol their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites and Partners in the ſame Cauſe with unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Commendations; and load their Adverſaries with odious Characters, and falſe Accuſations; turn Superſtitious to the laſt degree; and interpret every Event as ominous, and a Prognoſtication of Good in favour of themſelves and Friends; and a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Providence, againſt thoſe that are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in oppoſition to them. Nay, they carry this Folly ſo far, as not to ſee or allow any Virtue or Good quality in their Adverſaries; repreſent them as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Villains, and would have us believe, that all who think, and act, and deſign otherwiſe, than They themſelves do, muſt be either Knave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53648:326"/>vindicating or excuſing, and not running into the ſame Exceſſe of Partiality and Prejudice, the ſame unreaſonable Cenſures and Condemnations, with theſe hot-headed Zealots. Whereas indeed nothing can be more extravagant, than to imagine that a Man who is not one of Us cannot poſſibly be a Good Man; and that he may not, for the main, or at leaſt in ſome caſes where the Point in difference is no way concerned, be very honeſt and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, though it be his unhappineſs, to be under a wrong perſuaſion, and in ſome particulars embarqued in the Intereſt or Opinions of thoſe who are very naughty Men. That Paſſion ſhould commit a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the Will, is but too much; but that it ſhould debauch and blind the Judgment, and deſtroy Charity and common Senſe, is abominable, and not to be endured. And Men ſhould by all means think themſelves obliged to proceed with Equity and Candor; to ſee and to acknowledge Goodneſs, whereever it is to be found, though in the worſt and moſt miſtaken Enemies; and not to palliate, or overlook, much leſs to defend and applaud the Vices and Follies of our Friends and Followers; but to lay aſide all private Conſiderations, and frankly to expreſs our Deteſtation of theſe things, let the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons guilty of them be who, or what they will. The contrary wicked practice (for a very wicked one it is) ſeems to proceed in great meaſure from want to conſidering and diſtinguiſhing aright, what the Points in difference are, and how far they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. For it is moſt certain, that where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy is no way concerned, we ought to behave our ſelves with all manner of Indifference; and paſs fair and equitable Judgments, as we would do, ſuppoſing no Diſpute or Diſagreement at all. And Reſentments ſhould never be carried beyond that particular Subject which provokes them; nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of all Paſſions, ſuffered to grow general and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53648:326"/>unlimited. And Theſe are ſome of the many Evils, which too great Eagerneſs and Intention of Mind naturally brings upon Men, let the Matter we ſet our hearts ſo much upon, be what it will; for this Diſpoſition is capable of Exceſs, and liable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, when fixed upon the very beſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and a Man may ſuffer by being too vehement and hot, in the purſuit even of Goodneſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Now in order to moderate this Affectionate Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and reduce the Mind to due Temper; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man ought to remember, that the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thing given us in charge by God and Nature, that to which we have the ſtrongeſt Obligations, and conſequently ſuch as ought to be firſt ſatisfied, is, That Every Man ſhould look well to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: This good management of our ſelves is the very buſineſs upon which we were ſent into the World at firſt, and are continued in it ſtill. And this Duty we do by no means diſcharge faithfully, except the Peace, and Tranquility, and Liberty of our Minds be conſulted and preſerved. And preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe cannot be, unleſs we make it our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Rule, to Lend our ſelves to a Friend, but to Give our ſelves up to none but our ſelves; to take buſineſs in hand, but not to lay it to heart; to bear it as a burden, and be content with ſuſtaining the weight of it upon our ſhoulders, but not to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate and unite with it, by making it inſeparable and a part of our ſelves; to beſtow all poſſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but not to miſplace and throw away our Affections, upon it; to faſten eagerly upon very few things, and to ſtick to them only ſo, as ſtill to continue at our own pleaſure. This is the true, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Remedy, againſt all the Inconveniences and Uneaſineſſes formerly mentioned; and this is not any ſuch ſelfiſh or narrow-ſpirited advice, as ſome
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53648:327"/>may imagine. It does not condemn or exclude any of thoſe Duties or good Offices required from us; it does not prejudice to the Publick, our Friends, or our Neighbours; ſo far from That, that it is moſt certain We are bound by all the Tyes of Honour and Religion, to be courteous and kind, aſſiſting and ſerviceable to one another; to comply with the Cuſtoms and Occaſions of the World, and apply our ſelves to the obſervance of the one, and the Supply of the other, as our Circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and in order hereunto, every man is obliged to contribute to the Common Good; and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to perform all thoſe Duties and mutual Offices, which any way concern him, as a Member of the Body Politick, and may conduce to the Benefit of Human Society.<note n="*" place="bottom">Qui ſibi amious eſt, hunc omnibus ſeito eſſe amicum.</note> 
                           <hi>He that is a Friend to himſelf, is a Friend to all Mankind;</hi> for the Love and Care of one's ſelf is ſo far from engroſſing, and confining all we can do to our own ſingle perſons; that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and puts us upon the being as univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and diſſuſing our Powers, as far and wide as we can. But ſtill, I muſt inſiſt upon it, that the moſt generous Inclinations and Endeavours of this kind ought to be tempered with Moderation and Prudence; and no Man is publick-ſpirited as he ſhould be, unleſs he be diſcreet withal; and That in theſe Two reſpects particularly. Firſt, Not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or lay himſelf out upon every occaſion that offers indifferently; but firſt to ſit down, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well the Juſtice, the Reaſonableneſs, and the Neceſſity of the thing; whether it will anſwer his deſign, and be worth his pains. And if this were done, a world of trouble might be ſpared. Then Secondly, That even thoſe occaſions, which have the beſt Title to his Application, may be followed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53648:327"/>without Violence and Vexation of Mind. A Man ſhould contract his Deſires, and bring them within as ſmall a Compaſs as he can; The Little he does deſire, ſhould be purſued with Temper, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired moderately; His application ſhould be free from Anxiety, and Diſtraction: And in any the moſt Important Matters that we undertake, we may be allowed to employ our Hands, our Feet, our Tongue, the Attention of our Thoughts, the Sweat of our Brows, all proper means in order to the effecting them, nay, to ſpend our Blood, and hazard our Lives, if the occaſion require it; but ſtill all this is to be done with a Reſerve; calmly and conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without Paſſion and Torment; without Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Impatience. A Man muſt always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Government and Command of himſelf; the Health of his Body, the Soundneſs of his Mind, the Tranquility, and Eaſe of both, ſo far as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For Succeſs does by no means depend upon Heat, and Forwardneſs, and an Impetuous Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Will; but is much oftner and better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without it; and the Cooler our proceedings are, the greater Expectations we may entertain from them. It is a vulgar and a very groſs Miſtake, that no Affair is undertaken heartily and to purpoſe, without a great deal of Noiſe, and Hurry, and Buſtle. For, as I have already ſhewed, theſe only diſorder and perplex the Cauſe; put Men beſide their Byaſs, and are ſo many freſh Obſtructions. How common a thing is it to obſerve vaſt numbers of Men, who venture their perſons in the Wars, and are in daily, hourly peril of their Lives; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any anxious Concern at all; they march up to the Cannon's mouth when their Poſt requires it, and puſh on to Action, and yet neither the Hazard, nor the Loſs of the Battels they fight, ever breaks them one Night's reſt; They conſider, This is their Duty, and upon that Conſideration they diſcharge
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53648:328"/>it chearfully. And yet at the ſame time that you ſee the Camp and the Field ſo eaſy, and void of Care; a Splenetick Politician, who never had the Courage to look Danger in the Face, ſhall ſit you at home, and teaze and afflict himſelf with the Event of this Engagement; and be a thouſand times more perplexed and mortified with any ill Succeſs, than thoſe very Soldiers, who ſpend their Blood, and ſtake down their Lives, in the Service.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> In a word; We muſt learn to underſtand our ſelves, and our Condition; and diſtinguiſh aright, between our private and perſonal, and our publick Capacities. For every one of us is under a double Character, and hath two parts to play. The one external, and viſible, but ſomewhat foreign and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; the other domeſtick, and proper, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to us. Now though our Shirt be next to our Skin, yet according to the Proverb, we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember, that how near ſoever our Shirt may be, our Skin is ſtill nearer to us. A Judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will diſcharge his Duty to the Publick, and fill an Office well; and yet at the ſame time will diſcern the Folly, and Wickedneſs, and Cheat, which a Publick Station expoſes him to the practice of. He will not decline the thing; becauſe it is agreeable to the Cuſtom and Conſtitution of his Countrey; it is neceſſary and uſeful to the Publick, and perhaps advantagious to himſelf: He will ſubmit in many things to do as the World does, becauſe the Reſt of Mankind live at the ſame rate; and ſince he cannot mend the World, it is to no purpoſe to diſturb it, by being ſingular. But ſtill he will look upon this, as a matter ſomewhat foreign, and conſider this Character as adventitious and accidental, not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him; it is what he is obliged to put on, and appear in; but he was not born with it, nor is it a part of him. And therefore he will always exerciſe it with all due Limitations and Reſervations; and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53648:328"/>not ſo embark in Buſineſs, as to be quite ſwallowed up in it: but manage Matters ſo, that he may ſtill enjoy himſelf; and be free and eaſy with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friend; or at leaſt, within his own Breaſt; not ſo ſerve the World, as to neglect, and be out of a Condition to ſerve himſelf; nor endeavour the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others, at the Expence or Loſs of a Good, that is truly and properly his own.</p>

The Two Firſt whereof, are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53648:329"/>ſtill in the nature of Prefaces to the Main Work; neceſſary to be laid in the Quality of Foundations, upon which to raiſe this Glorious Superſtructure. And the Former and Principal of theſe two, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Subject of This Chapter, is <hi>Probity,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That true Honeſty and Integrity of Heart and Life is the Firſt, the Chief, the Fundamental Point of True Wiſdom, is an Aſſertion, which it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be thought needleſs for me to give my ſelf any great trouble in proving. For in truth, all Mankind agree in highly extolling, and zealouſly pretending to it; (though it is but too manifeſt, that what ſome do in this kind ſeriouſly, and out of Conſcientious regard to their Duty, and the real Worth of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; others put on only, to ſet the beſt face upon the matter; and are compelled to diſſemble from Shame, and Fear, and the Ill-conſequences of avowing the contrary.) Thus far then the whole World is agreed; that Honeſty is recommended, and reſpected, and at leaſt complimented; every Man profeſſes to be paſſionately in love with it, and ſubſcribes himſelf its <hi>moſt Faithful, moſt Affectionate,</hi> and <hi>moſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Servant.</hi> So that I may ſpare my ſelf the pains of arguing in behalf of the Thing in general; but I am afraid notwithſtanding, it will prove no ſuch eaſy matter to make Men agree with the Notions of that, which in my eſteem is the True and Eſſential Honeſty, and to perſuade the as univerſal Love, but eſpecially the univerſal practice of That, which I think neceſſary upon this occaſion. For as to That, which is in common vogue, and uſually reputed ſuch; though the World I know are generally ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and trouble themſelves ſo little about under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or attaining to any thing better, that (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a very few Wiſe Men,) they have no Ideas, no Wiſhes beyond this; yet I make no difficulty to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is all but a ſpurious and counterfeit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53648:329"/>Virtue; Sham and Trick; and the product of Art and Study, Falſhood and Diſguiſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now firſt of all, We cannot but be ſenſible, <note place="margin">Falſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pcarances of it.</note> that Men are very often drawn on, and puſht forward to good Actions by ſeveral ſorts of Motives. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch as are by no means commendable; As Natural Defects, and Infirmities, Paſſion and Fancy, nay ſometimes by Vice, and Things in their own Nature Sinful. Thus Chaſtity, and Sobriety, and Temperance of all ſorts, may be, and often are, owing to a weak Body, and tender Conſtitution, which cannot ſupport Exceſs. Contempt of Death, to Peeviſhneſs and Diſcontent; Patience under Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, Reſolution and Preſence of Thought in Dangers, to Want of Apprehenſion and Judgment, and a due ſenſe, how great or imminent the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is. Valour, and Liberality, and Juſtice, are often inſpired and practiſed by Ambition and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory; the Effects of good Conduct, diſcreet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, of Fear, and Shame, and Avarice. And what a World of renowned and noble Exploits have been owing to Preſumption and Foolhardineſs; Raſhneſs and Inconſideration? Thus, what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call Actions and Inſtances of Virtue, are in reality no better than Masks, and counterfeit Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of it: They have the Air and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, but by no means the Subſtance of it. So much reſemblance there is, that the Vulgar, who are no Criticks in Faces, may eaſily miſtake the one for the other; and ſo much of good there is in the Effects and Conſequences of ſuch Actions, that other people may be allowed to call them Virtuous; but it is impoſſible the perſon himſelf who does them, ſhould eſteem them ſuch; or that any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Man can either allow them this Character, when nicely examined; or think one jot the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Man that does them. For Intereſt, or Honour, or Reputation, or Cuſtom and Compliance,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53648:330"/>or ſome other Cauſes altogether foreign to Virtue, will be found at the bottom; and however beautiful the Front may be, the Foundation is rotten and ſtark naught. Sometimes very great and ſurprizing things are the Reſult of nothing better, than mere Stupidity and Brutiſhneſs; which gave occaſion for that Reflection, That Wiſdom and Inſenſibility met together in the ſame Point, and both of them felt and hardened themſelves alike under Accidents and Misfortunes. From all which, and a great deal more, that might be ſaid, it appears, how exceeding dangerous and uncertain a method thoſe men take, who look no further than the outward Face of things, and from the actions, as we ſee them, form a peremptory Judgment of the Probity, or the Diſingenuity of the Perſon. Whereas, for a right underſtanding of this matter, we ought to take a diſtinct view of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; examine the whole Movement; and mark well what Springs they are, that ſet it on going. For it often happens, that very ill men do very good, and commendable, and beneficial Actions: And both Good and Bad men reſtrain themſelves, and avoid Evil; but though both abſtain alike, yet they do it out of very different Principles, as <hi>Horace</hi> hath obſerved pertinently enough to this purpoſe,

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That Integrity, which paſſes in common Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the True,<note place="margin">What noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the world have of it.</note> and is generally recommended and extolled,a nd which indeed is all, that thoſe who have the Character and Commendation of Juſt, and Honeſt, and Fair-dealing men pretend to, is at the beſt but a mean, and formal, and pedantick Virtue: Such as is a Slave to Laws, and takes its Meaſures from thence; is check'd and kept under by Hope and Fear; is acquired, learned, produced and practiced upon the account of, and in ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Religion we profeſs, the Government we live under, the Cuſtoms of our Country, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Superiors, the Examples of Them we converſe with, bound up in Forms, and limited by the Letter of the Law; an effeminate, poor-ſpirited Honeſty, perplexed with Doubts, and Scruples, and Terrors of Conſcience. For ſome People never think themſelves innocent, and as they ſhould be; when their Minds are quiet, and eaſy, and void of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53648:331"/>Fear. Now ſuch an Honeſty as this, muſt not only be mutable and manifold in ſeveral parts of the World, and vary as the Religion, and Laws, and Examples, and Forms and Modes of the Countries, where men happen to converſe, ſhall vary; (For where the Springs of Action change, the whole Movement muſt needs change proportionably). But, which is yet more to its diſparagement, it muſt needs be irregular, and unequal; inconſiſtent with it ſelf; floating and unſettled; full of Ebbings and Flowings, Intervals of Heat and Cold; inconſtant and precarious; depending on the Events and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Affairs; the Offering of Occaſions, and Interpoſition of ſudden Emergencies; the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Perſons and Circumſtances; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other unforeſeen Accidents, which move this Man and his Virtue, as a Boat is moved by Sails and Oars, by ſudden ſtrokes and ſpurts; and guſts and puſſs of Wind. In a word, Theſe Men are good purely by Chance, by fits and ſtarts; by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and very diſtant motives; and not in reality, and by virtue of a fix'd and governing Principle. This Defect of theirs is what not only ſtanders by, but even themſelves are inſenſible of; they never obſerve, nor diſcover their own imperfections, but it were eaſy to ſhew them to themſelves, and make the thing plain to them, by holding a ſtiff Rein, obſerving them more nicely and diſtinctly; and quickning their attention a little. And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be a more effectual Conviction of their Deficiency, than the mighty inequality of their Actions and Tempers, and their own Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with themſelves. For in one and the ſame caſe, you ſhall find them coming to quite different reſolutions and determinations; and acting in direct contradiction, to what they have done before. Sometimes they are ſo heavy and dull, that neither Whip nor Spur can get them forward; and preſently
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53648:331"/>upon the full ſpeed, that no Bit can ſtop them. Now this prodigious unevenneſs and difference of Behaviour is occaſioned by the difference of thoſe external Motives, by which they are governed and managed; And as Theſe ſometimes agitate and heat them violently, ſwell, and multiply; or grow lukewarm and cold, and flag and droop again; ſo muſt Their Virtue and Zeal needs increaſe and abate accordingly; and thus it diſtinguiſhes it ſelf from Real and Subſtantial Virtue, by that Property natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all Accidents; which is, the being capable of Augmentation and Diminution; and ſo of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Extract, than all thoſe Qualities, whoſe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it is, according to the Terms of the Schools, <hi>Recipere magis &amp; minus.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now That True and Subſtantial Integrity, which I inſiſt upon at preſent as a neceſſary qualification,<note place="margin">What it is in Truth.</note> in order to Wiſdom, is free, and eaſy; void of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and Conſtraint; maſculine and generous; pleaſant and chearful; equal and uniform; conſtant and ſteady; magnanimous and brave; keeping on its own courſe, and never looking to the right hand, or to the left; never ſtanding ſtill, or ſlackning, or quickning its pace; upon the account of Wind or Weather; Accidents and Occaſions may change, but This continues always the ſame. It is not in the power of any thing to alter or ſhake it; my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Man's Judgment and Will are fixed and immutable; and the Soul, where this Integrity hath taken up its Reſidence, is never to be corrupted, or diverted to diſhoneſt purpoſes. For the Sincerity of the Heart is the Virtue we are treating of; There it is lodged, by That we muſt judge; for External Actions, and thoſe eſpecially that are of a publick Capacity and Importance, are of a Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration very different from this; as I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew hereafter, when my Method brings me to treat of them diſtinctly.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Of this I ſhall give my Reader ſome deſcription, when I have firſt deſired him to recollect what was ſaid in the Preface; and that in agreement to the deſign of this Treatiſe, I ſpeak of Probity and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at preſent, as Virtues purely Human, ſuch as entitle a Man to the Character of an Honeſt or a prudent Man with regard to Civil Affairs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Converſation; without any reſpect at all to the Chriſtian and more exalted ſenſe of the thing. Of which nevertheleſs, though Foreign to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intent of my Book, I ſhall take occaſion to ſay ſome little matter, before I leave this Subject.</p>
                        <p>The true Spring and Source of this Probity is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which obliges a man to be ſuch as he ought to be; that is, to conform, and govern himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her Dictates and Directions. For Nature maintains a twofold Character, and is at once a Miſtreſs to Command, and a Law to teach, and ſet us out our Duty. With regard to the former of theſe Capacities, there is an Internal, Univerſal, that is, a natural Obligation incumbent upon every Man, to be an honeſt, ſincere Man, and ſo to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the End of his Creation. And This is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ſo ſtrong, an Inducement ſo weighty, that no one need look for any greater, any additional Motives; nor indeed is it poſſible, to find any that deſerve greater Deference and Regard; any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to it, ſince its Validity is of the ſame date with our Selves, and both It and We came into the World together. Every Man ought to make it his buſineſs and care to be a good Man, upon this very account, becauſe he is a Man; for he who is regardleſs of this point, is a Monſter, renounces himſelf, reproaches his Nature, and in effect ceaſes to be, what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and uſurps a Form, which of Right belongs not to him. This Probity muſt alſo be of its own growth, without Cultivating or Conſtraint; that is, It muſt proceed from an Internal Principle, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53648:332"/>God hath wrought into our Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not be the effect of Accident, or any foreign Inducement. No Man, whoſe Will is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, would chuſe a thing in its declenſion, as debaſed and fallen from its natural Perfection; It is a Contradiction to pretend a Man deſires a thing, and that he is indifferent at the ſame time, whether it be what it ought, and have all the Commendable Qualities of right belonging to it. A Man is ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to have all his parts in their true Perfection; his Head, his Eyes, his Judgment, his Memory, his whole Body; nay, the very Conveniences and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements belonging to that Body; and ſhall his Will and his Conſcience be the only neglected things about him? Shall it be no part of his Care whether Theſe have their due Integrity or not? I would have a Man reſolute in Goodneſs, though it were but purely upon his own account, and in regard to his Character as he is a Man; ſenſible, that to Act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is, as much as in him lies, to abandon and deſtroy himſelf; and thus Probity will be an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principle, as eſſential to, and of a piece with him, as He is with himſelf. No external Cauſe is capable of being a ſufficient Foundation for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all ſuch are foreign and accidental; and as ſuch are liable to Changes and Decays; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Foundation ſinks, the Superſtructure muſt of neceſſity tumble with it: If a Man be virtuous and juſt for the ſake of his Reputation, or any other Advantage, What Obligation will this be to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, to his Solitary Actions? Take off the Hopes of his Virtue being known, and you either take off the whole thing, or cool, and check his vigour in the practice of it. If fear of Laws and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſtrain him; put him but in a way to elude the Laws, and eſcape publick Diſcovery; and what ſhall ſecure his Honeſty then? So poor, ſo precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo uncertain a thing is this Occaſional Virtue:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53648:333"/>And yet This is the Virtue in vogue, and what very few riſe beyond. As the World goes, 'tis very well if all theſe Conſiderations will prevail upon Men to do what becomes them; nay if their Actions be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or blameleſs, whatever their ſecret Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are. Now I expect, in the perſon whom this Treatiſe undertakes to form, a Probity that will ſtand upon its own bottom; ſo firmly rooted, that you can no more ſeparate it from the Man, than you can his very human Nature it ſelf. I expect he ſhould never yield to do an Ill thing, though he could be aſſured it will never be known. For is it poſſible to conceal it from himſelf? And if his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be privy to it, what need any farther Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? This One is more than all the World beſides. By the ſame reaſon he muſt be as obſtinately good, notwithſtanding any Recompence which would bribe him to be otherwiſe; for it is impoſſible he ſhould receive a valuable Conſideration in this Caſe; and nothing can be ſo near to him, as his own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which Wickedneſs impairs and corrupts. To yield upon ſuch Temptations, is like the being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a very ill Horſe, provided a Man have an embroider'd Saddle. I muſt therefore inſiſt upon it, that being a Man, and taking care to live as becomes one, that is, taking care to be a ſincere good Man, ſhould always go together, and be above the power of all the World to ſeparate them. This particular I think is ſufficiently urged, let us now proceed to the next.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now the Model and Pattern, the Spring and Source of this Integrity, is the Law of Nature; by which I mean Univerſal Equity and Reaſon, that Candle of our Maker lighted up in every breaſt, to guide, and ſhine in us perpetually. For This is the Dictate and Direction of God himſelf; He is the King, and This the Fundamental Law of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, a Ray and Beam of the Divine Nature, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53648:333"/>flows from, and hath a neceſſary Connection and Dependence upon that Eternal and Immutable Law, which the Almighty preſcribes to his own Actions. A Man that proceeds upon this Principle, is his own Rule; for he acts in agreement with the nobleſt and moſt valuable part of his Nature. This Man's Honeſty is Eſſential to, and Inſeparable from him; not precarious and uncertain, and owing merely to Chance and Occaſion; For this Light and Law is born with, and bred in us; a piece of our Frame, and Original. Conſtitution; and from thence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Name of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>the Law of Nature.</hi> Such a Man by conſequence will be a good Man conſtantly, and at all times; his Virtue will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and even; every Place, every Emergency will find him the ſame. For this Law of Nature is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual; the Obligation of it is laſting and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Equity and Reaſon of it are Eternal; written in large and indelible Characters; no Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent can deface them, no length of time waſte or wear them out; even Wickedneſs it ſelf, by the Cuſtomary Habits whereof the poſitive and additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Improvements of this Law, are corrupted; yet cannot debauch, or exterminate theſe firſt and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions; no Place, no Time can alter or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe them; but they continue every where the ſame. The Collections inferred from them differ infinitely, but theſe firſt Principles themſelves, which are the Ground of all Moral Inſtitutions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no Change, no Increaſe, no Abatement; no Fits and Starts, no Ebbings and Flowings; but, as they are a part of our Subſtance, ſo do they agree with what the Schools ſay of all Subſtances in general,<note n="*" place="bottom">Subſtantia non recipit magis &amp; minùs.</note> that it is contrary to their nature <hi>to be more or leſs</hi> than they are. Why then, Vain Man, doſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53648:334"/>thou trouble thy ſelf, to ſeek abroad for ſome Law and Rule to Mankind? What can Books or Maſters tell thee, which thou mighteſt not tell thy ſelf? What can Study or Travel ſhew, which at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of much leſs pains thou might'ſt not ſee at home, by deſcending into thy own Conſcience, and hearkning attentively to its Admonitions? When Ignorance of this kind is pretended, the ſame Reply is fit for Thee, which would be given to a ſhuffling Debtor; who, when Payment is demanded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes not to know how the Money became due, when all the while he hath the Bill about him: For thou carrieſt the Bond, and the particulars of thy Debt in thy own Boſom; and what thou ſeekeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of from others, canſt not but know, if thou conſult thy Self.</p>
                        <p>To what purpoſe is all this Labour and Coſt; the toilſome tumbling over of Codes, and Inſtitutes; of Precedents, and Reports; of Statutes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, when all theſe are contained in one ſmall portable Volume? The Two Tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Twelve Tables of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 2.12.</note> the Law written in the hearts of Them who had no Law; and in ſhort, all the Rules of Equity, and Good Laws, that have any where been enacted, and obtained in the World, are nothing elſe but Copies and Tranſcripts produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in open Court, and publiſhed from that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which thou keepeſt cloſe within thee, and yet all the while pretendeſt to know nothing of the matter; ſtifling and ſuppreſſing, as much as in thee lies, the Brightneſs of that Light, which ſhines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and ſo falling under the Condemnation of thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> 
                           <hi>who hold,</hi> or detain <hi>the Truth of God in Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> If This have not been ſufficiently publiſhed, and promulged as loud, as clear, as intelligibly as other humane Laws, the only Reaſon is, that that Light which is really All-heavenly and Divine, hath been put under a Buſhel,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53648:334"/>that is, too much neglected, and induſtriouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. All other Inſtitutions are but ſo many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets and Streams derived from this common Source: And although they be more viſible, and obvious, and expreſs, yet is not the Water they carry ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, nor ſo lively and pure, as that of the unſeen Spring within thy own Breaſt; if thy own Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence did not ſuffer it to waſte and dry up. It is not, I ſay, ſo Copious; for as one well obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Quàm multa Pietas, Humanitas, Liberalitas, Fides exigunt, quae extra Tabulas ſunt?</note> 
                           <hi>What a world of Good Offices are there, which Prety, Humanity, Liberality, and Fidelity require from a Man, and yet no written or poſitive Law ever preſcribed?</hi> Alas! how poor and ſcanty a thing is that Honeſty of your Formal and Hypocritical Pretenders, who ſtick to the Letter of the Law, and think, when That is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they have fully diſcharged their Duty; whereas there are infinite Obligations incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man, which no human Law ever binds upon him.<note n="†" place="bottom">Quàm anguſta Innocentia ad Legem bonum eſſe; latiùs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiorum quàm Juris patet Regula.</note> 
                           <hi>He that is honeſt only in the Eye of the Law, hath but a very ſlender ſort of Innocence to boaſt; for the Meaſure of our Duty is of a much larger extent, than the Law can pretend to.</hi> 
                           <q>There are infinite Caſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen; ſudden Emergencies, and extraordinary Conjunctures; the Occaſions and Circumſtances whereof are too many and too intricate, for any human Wiſdom to foreſee; and much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for it to make any competent Proviſion for; ſo that a Man muſt often be left to his own Judgment and Diſcretion; and, even where he is not, a Good Man will ſometimes think the Rule too narrow; and diſdain to conſine or cramp up his Virtue within the Compaſs of that, which was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53648:335"/>thought neceſſary to be impoſed upon every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Man.</q> And as this inviſible Fountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is more exuberant and plenteous; ſo is it more lively, and pure, and ſtrong, than any of thoſe Streams derived from it. Of which we need but this ſingle Teſtimony; That, whenever any Diſputes ariſe about the Interpretation and right Execution of a poſitive Law, the conſtant and beſt Method of Underſtanding the Equity and true Intent of it, is by running it back to its firſt Head, and obſerving what is moſt agreeable to the Law of Nature in the Caſe; This is the Teſt and Touch, This the Level and the Truth, by which all the reſt are to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, as we commonly ſay,<note n="*" place="bottom">Anima Legis Ratio.</note> 
                           <hi>Reaſon is the Soul and Life of the Law;</hi> here we find things clear and limpid in their Source, which when drawn out into Rivulets, grow foul and ſullied, by all that Faction, and Intereſt, Ambition, and ſerving of Parties, which corrupt all human Sanctions and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have deſcribed to you a Real, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, Radical, Fundamental Honeſty; born with us; rooted in us; ſpringing from the Seed of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reaſon. This in the Soul, is like the Spring and Balance in a Clock, it regulates all its motions; like the Natural Warmth in the Body, which ſuſtains and preſerves it ſelf, and is both its own Strength and Safety, and the Perſon's to whom it belongs. The Man that proceeds according to This, acts in conformity to the Will of God, in conſiſtence and agreement with himſelf; in compliance with Nature; and obedience to thoſe Rules, upon which all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Civil Conſtitutions are founded; he proceeds ſmoothly, gently, ſilently; His Virtue draws little Obſervation perhaps, as it makes no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53648:335"/>Noiſe; but ſlides on, and keeps its Courſe, like a Boat carried down by the Courſe of the Water in a Calm day: Whereas all other ſorts of Virtue are the Products of Art and Accident, grafted into us by Diſcipline, and not of our own natural growth; fickle and out of Temper, like the Intermitting Heat and Cold of a Fever; they are acquired at firſt, and drawn out into exerciſe afterwards, by Chance and Occaſion, practiſed upon foreign and diſtant Conſiderations; acting by ſudden ſtarts, and ſhort ſpurts; with Clamour, and Noiſe, with Hurry and Clutter, with Oſtentation and Vainglory.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And from hence we are led to the true meaning of all thoſe Glorious things, which Philoſophers and Wiſe Men in all Ages have ſaid of Nature: For what Doctrines are more common in the mouths of every one of them, than theſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Naturam ſi ſequaris Ducem, nuſquam aberrabis.

                           <hi>That the way for a Man to live well, is to live agreeably to Nature; That a perfect Conformity with Nature is the Supreme Good, the moſt exquiſite Happineſs Mankind are capable of; That if we make Nature our Miſtreſs, and Guide, and conſtantly follow the Directions ſhe gives, we ſhall never go amiſs?</hi> By all which it is plain, that Nature is ſet to ſignify that Univerſal Reaſon and Equity, which is given for a Light to our Minds; and is both of that vaſt comprehenſion, as to contain under it the Seeds of all kind of Virtue, Probity, and Juſtice; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parent, that gives Birth to all wholſome and good Laws, all juſt and Equitable Judgments, that ever were or will be given; and alſo of that Clearneſs and Perſpicuity too, that Men of the meaneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Attainments, might determine themſelves, and be conducted by it. Whatever ſcandalous or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53648:336"/>diſparaging Reflections ſome may aſperſe Nature with, or how great a part of them ſoever this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted State of it may deſerve, yet there is no doubt to be made, if we look back to their Original, and primitive Conſtitution, but all things were created and diſpoſed in the beſt Order and Condition they were capable of; and had their firſt Motions toward Good infuſed and interwoven with their Being, and ſtrong Tendencies to the End they ought to aſpire after. This was the Work and Wiſdom of Nature; and from hence it is, that no Man who follows and obeys her Dictates, can ever fail of obtaining and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the End, and true Happineſs proper to his Species. For after all; Men are naturally and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Good; and when they follow Evil, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Nature, and are ſeduced by the falſe Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Profit, or of Pleaſure: And becauſe Theſe are the two governing Motives, and ſuch as will be ſure to bear a powerful Sway in the World; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Makers of Laws have always found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to propoſe two contrary Objects, that is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Puniſhment, to the Perſons whoſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they would engage.

                        <p>Nature without all Controverſy is a ſufficient Guide, a gentle Miſtreſs, capable of inſtructing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53648:336"/>every one of us, in all the Branches of our Duty, provided we would but be as careful to hearken to its Admonitions; to exert, and keep it awake and active. There is no need for Us to beg or to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from Art and Learning, thoſe Means, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and Rules, which are neceſſary for the good Government of our ſelves; for each of us can ſubſiſt and live by himſelf; his own proper Stock is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintain him. A Happy, and a Contented Life is indeed what every one does and ſhould aim at; but theſe are Bleſſings by no means entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Learning, or Parts, or Greatneſs, or Honour; a Man may attain them, and never ſee the face of a Court, or a City. There is a Proportion common and natural to all, which is enough for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and All beyond that, however valuable, as additional Advantages, are yet by no means neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we can do very well without them; and which is worſe, we are ſo far from doing very well upon their account, that they do but increaſe our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and our Difficulties, and do us more Hurt than Good. How many plain, and ignorant, and mean Men do we ſee, that live with more ſenſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Satisfaction, more ſedate and undiſturbed both in their Minds and Fortunes; and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can meet, and encounter Poverty or Pain, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Death, with a better Grace, and greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, than the moſt Learned, and celebrated Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers? And if one take the pains to obſerve it nicely, you will find more frequent Inſtances, more eminent Patterns of Patience, and Conſtancy, and Evenneſs of Temper, among plain Countrey Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe of mean Condition, than all the Schools can boaſt of. Theſe are ſimple and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they go on where Nature leads, are influenced by the Reaſons ſhe ſuggeſts, and the Impreſſions ſhe makes, without creating new and imaginary Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. They feel no more than is to be felt, and uſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53648:337"/>no Art and Induſtry to torment themſelves; Their Paſſions are low, and quiet, and ſmooth, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Theirs who take pains to rufflle them; and eſteem it a piece of Bravery to indulge and blow them up; and ſo they go on in all their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs more calmly and conſiderately, without Heat, or Diſorder; whereas others look big and bluſter, do every thing with Pomp and Hurry; are in perpetual Agitation and Alarm, and keep themſelves and all Mankind awake. One of the greateſt Maſters, and moſt exquiſite Improvers of Nature was <hi>Socrates,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was proportionably Eminent for Art and Learning.

My Complaint is, that whereas the Concurrent Advice of all Wiſe men hath been to follow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53648:337"/>the Generality of Mankind run away from it.

We have all of us a buſy turbulent Spirit, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be ever managing, and governing, and will have a hand in every thing; this is variable and humorſome, perpetually buſtling, and reſtleſs; fond of Novelty, and Diſguiſe; inventing, adding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; never pleaſed long with the ſame thing, nor ever content with pure Nature, and unaffected Simplicity; but a Contemner and Vilifier of Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if it were not poſſible for any thing to be Good, which is void of Art, and Cunning, and nice Contrivance. <hi>Thus</hi>

                           <hi>Virtue, which is genuine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Frankneſs and Openneſs peculiar to it, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and changed into dark and crafty Speculation.</hi> And beſides all this, One Fault more we are tainted with; which is, The Diſeſteem of every thing in general, which is the product of our own Soil; What we can have for nothing is worth nothing; it muſt be far fetched and dear bought, to recommend it: Foreign things only can pleaſe; and in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this Whimſey it is, that we prefer Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nature; which is in effect, To ſhut out the Sun when ſhining in its Strength, and to light up Candles at Mid-day. All which Follies and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant humours are owing to One more; which is a Weakneſs in a manner entail'd upon the whole World; That, I mean, of eſtimating things, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53648:338"/>to their real and intrinſick Value, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the Shew, and Figure, and Noiſe they make; which is to renounce our own Judgment and Experience, and in effect to give our ſelves up to be determined by the Common Opinion, of thoſe, who are leaſt qualified to know or judge at all.</p>
                        <p>Nor does this Folly ſtop here; but we proceed to yet higher degrees of Inſolence; we even trample Nature under foot, diſdain, deſpiſe, and are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed of it; are nice in Poſitive and National Laws, and diſregard thoſe that are Natural and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Nay, for the ſake of bringing Ceremony and Form into Reputation, (which is a moſt horrible Indignity, and very Contemptuous Treatment); We cancel and condemn a Law of God's making, to advance Laws of Civility and Good Manners of our own forging. Thus Art carries away Nature; the Shadow is of greater Conſideration with us than the Body; and the Air and Face of things, than the Solidity and Subſtance. We take great care to cover and conceal ſome things that are natural, that we may not give offence; we bluſh at the very ſound of ſome words in modeſty and good breeding; and yet we are under no Fears, no reſtraint of doing things unlawful, and unnatural. To keep us at as great a diſtance from ſome ſorts of Sins as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we are not allowed ſo much as to name the parts employed in them; and yet after all this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous ſhyneſs, How many are there who never boggle in the leaſt at abandoning themſelves to all manner of Debauchery and Laſciviouſneſs? It was an old Complaint of the Stoicks, that though ſome very natural and innocent Actions of Life were induſtriouſly concealed; yet Many others were named without a bluſh, which yet were in their own nature wicked and abominable; and what both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon deteſt; ſuch as Perjury, Treachery, Cheating, Lying, Murther, and the like. We may
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53648:338"/>improve the Complaint, by adding, that in Our days Men pretend to more nicety in Converſation; but theſe really wicked things, they do not only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Shame, but act without Fear. Nay, even in Treaſons and Aſſaſſinations, thoſe blackeſt of all Villains make pretenſions to Ceremony, and think themſelves obliged to Murther in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Duty; and when this is done, that it be done with ſome ſort of Decency. Prodigious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Folly! That Injuſtice ſhould complain of Incivility; and Malice think it ſelf wronged by Indiſcretion. Does not the Art of Ceremony then plainly prevail over Nature, and ſhew, that its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is much ſtronger upon corrupt Mankind? Ceremony forbids us to expreſs ſome things which Nature allows and juſtifies, and we ſubmit contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Nature and Reaſon would reſtrain us from wicked and miſchievous actions, and no body obeys, or at all regards them. This is manifeſtly to Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute our Conſciences, and abandon all diſtinctions, all common ſenſe of Good and Evil; and yet at the ſame time think our ſelves obliged to put on a modeſt Face, and look grave and demure. As if it mattered not, what we are within, ſo nothing appear amiſs in our Countenance; and the ſetting our looks in Form, were of more conſequence, than the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of our Souls. This Hypotheſis is moſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and Abſurd, and Nature cannot furniſh us with an Incongruity like it, in all the Creatures that ever God made. My meaning is not here, what ſome may maliciouſly repreſent it, to find fault with that Decency and Ceremony, which gives an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Beauty to our Actions, and ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſtrictly regarded.

Inſomuch that we are wonderfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and at a loſs, What and How many thoſe Laws are, which ſhe preſcribes to us. The peculiar Character, by which the Law of Nature uſed to be diſtinguiſhed from all others, is that of Univerſal Approbation and Conſent. For it muſt needs be ſuppoſed, that what this Common Mother and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of us All, had really enacted and appointed for our Rule, would be readily obeyed by all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that in This there would be, as it were, One Heart and One Soul; and not only every Nation and Countrey, but every private Man would come in, and live in perfect Agreement with it.</p>

'Tis plain, our own Species have little ſigns of it left; and if there be any Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kind ſtill unworn out, we muſt expect to meet with them only in Brutes, who want the Mercury we have, and ſo have not debauched and corrupted their primitive Conſtitution, by a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and reſtleſs Spirit, by the pretended Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Art, nor the Real Fopperies of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.

The reſt of the Creation however follow Nature entirely; they are content to ſtick and abide by that Firſt and Univerſal Order, and Rule, which the Great Author and Governor of all, thought ſit to eſtabliſh, and appoint. Man is the only factious and diſcontented Creature; he breaks in upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and good Government of the World; and while he profeſſes to mend and poliſh what Nature hath preſcribed, he confounds all with his Freedom of Will, and Gallantry of Spirit; ceaſes to be regular upon pretence of being more reſined; and deſtroys Nature, while he goes about to exalt and add to it.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> In a word then, True Honeſty and Integrity, That which is the very Foundation and Support of Wiſdom, conſiſts in following Nature, that is, to ſay, acting in agreement with right Reaſon. The Happineſs, the Aim, the End, That wherein all the Eaſe, the Liberty, the Contentment of the Mind is compriſed; and to be ſhort, the utmoſt perfection we are capable of in this World, is to govern our Lives
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53648:340"/>and Actions by the Rule; which Nature hath ſet us; and keeping the Order of our Creation. And that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſiſts in this, That the meaner and more groſs Appetites ſhould be kept in due Subjection, and that which is the moſt excellent part of our Nature, ſhould controul and bear ſway. That is, When Reaſon governs Senſe, and Truth is preferred before falſe and empty Appearances. And as the Needle, when touch'd with the Load-ſtone, reſts at no Point but the <hi>North;</hi> And by ſixing there becomes a Guide to Sailors in their Courſe: So Man is never in his due Poſition, when his Eyes are not ſixed upon this Primitive, this Divine, this Univerſal Law of Human Nature. For That is the proper Compaſs, to direct his Inclinations and Opinions by; and all the other helps he enjoys, are but ſo many freſh Lamps kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at this Original Light.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Now although This be a Power from which no Man is excluded, yet I cannot but acknowledge, that the putting it in practice, and bringing the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this kind to good effect, is not in every Man's power equally. Some do it with much greater Eaſe and Succeſs than others. There are a ſort of Perſons, who ſeem to be made for Virtue; their Complexion and whole Conſtitution diſpoſes and ſits them for it. Their Tempers are ſo well mixed, ſo naturally ſweet and gentle, that they feel in themſelves a ſtrong Inclination, and an Original Propenſity to Goodneſs and Integrity, without any pains to bend their Aſſections by Art, or to ſubdue and correct them by Diſcipline and Study. This happy Frame of Mind is what I conceive to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally owing to the firſt Formation of the Parts; the Proportions and Compoſition of the Spirits and Humours; and afterwards, to the proper and kindly Nouriſhment of a good Milk, and the Care and Management of their Infancy and firſt Beginnings of Education. And thoſe, who are thus inclined
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53648:340"/>to follow and comply with Nature and Reaſon, who bear a ſecret Reverence to its Dictates, and find little or no difficulty in ſubmitting, are the Perſons proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant, when we ſpeak of the Happineſs of good-tempered Men; and ſuch as we ſay, Nature hath been kind, or partial to. This natural and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Honeſty now, which comes as it were into the World with us, is properly called Good Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Quality of a Soul and Body well put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Humours duly moderated; It is a Sweetneſs, Eaſineſs, and Gentleneſs of Temper. By which I would not be ſo miſtaken, as to be thought to make no difference between this, and a Softneſs, which is indeed an effeminate, ſottiſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, and vitious Eaſineſs of Mind; which is managed and led by the Noſe; hath no Courage, no Choice of it's own; ſtrives to carry fair and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come agreeable to every body, and above all things declines giving offence to any; that will not do an Act of Virtue and Juſtice, if it be likely to diſpleaſe; nor dares refuſe the wickedeſt and moſt unbecoming Compliances, when the Favour and Opinion of Men lye at ſtake: Theſe Perſons have no regard in the Earth for Equity or Reaſon, the Merits of the Cauſe, or the Service of the Publick; but all their Conſiderations are fixed upon the Conſequences, as to their own private Intereſt, and they look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than who is like to be obliged or diſobliged, by what they do. It is of ſuch wretched, poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited, Complaiſant Perſons, that you hear People frequently give that falſe and moſt unjuſt Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; Oh he is a wonderful good Man! for he is kind even to the worſt and wickedeſt Men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed This Charge is much more deſerved and true of them; that ſuch a Man cannot be a Good Man, becauſe he is not ſevere to ill Men, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages their Villany by his Mildneſs, and falſe ſhew of Good nature. Such a Goodneſs as this is, ſhould
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53648:341"/>rather be called <hi>Harmleſsneſs,</hi> for it is juſt like that Quality of little Children, and Sheep, and ſuch other Beaſts, as we commonly call poor, innocent, ſimple Creatures. But the true Sincerity and Honeſty I am ſpeaking of, hath a very different Character; it is a maſculine, brave, vigorous, and active Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind; a ſtrong conſtant Affection, an eaſy, ready Inclination, by which the Soul embraces, and ſtands always bent to that which is conſonant to Reaſon and Nature; and Nature in this ſenſe is but another word for Goodneſs, and Equity, and Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Again: There are many Inſtances, on the other hand, of Perſons ſo croſs and ill contrived, that one would be tempted to think them Monſters in Human Form. They have a Diſpoſition ſingular and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo very rough and unmanageable, as if ſome evil Genius had ſhuffled them up together, in perfect Contradiction, and deſpight of Nature. In ſuch Circumſtances there is great difficulty; This vitious Diſpoſition muſt be cured and corrected; the Harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it ſweetned; its wild and bruitiſh Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tamed and made gentle; its crooked, and ſtiff, and irregular Humours bended and bowed down, and made flexible and complying with the ſtreight Rule and Plan of Univerſal Nature; which is the true Level and Standard, Men ſhould bring themſelves to. And the propereſt Remedy for effecting this Cure is for ſuch People to betake themſelves to the Study of Philoſophy (as <hi>Socrates</hi> did) and to the ſerious and reſolute practice of ſevere Virtue; which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Combat with Perverſeneſs of Temper; a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vigorous conflict with all manner of Vice; a laborious Study and Exerciſe of the Mind, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great deal of Time and Toil, indefatigable Diligence, and ſtrict Diſcipline. <hi>Virtue is attended with Hardſhip, and employed upon a ſubject, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be eaſy; Labour and Sweat wat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And again: <hi>The Gods have ſet a high price upon Virtue, and ſold it dear to Mankind, at the expence of great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trouble.</hi> Now the End of all this Severity and Pains, which I propoſe to Men of this unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Compoſition, is not to graft in a freſh Fruit upon the Crab-ſtock, not to introduce, I mean, a new, foreign, or artificial Honeſty, and conſequently ſuch a one, as (according to the account already given of this matter,) would at the beſt be but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional and accidental only, and ſo, far ſhort of that ſubſtantial and perfect Integrity I am aiming at: But the Deſign and effect of this Study muſt be to clear the Ruſt and Rubbiſh, to take away Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, not to create, but to awaken the Powers of Nature; to ſnuff and trim this Lamp within, which is foul, and burns dim; and to quicken all thoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Seeds of Goodneſs, that have been long kept down, and almoſt quite choaked and killed, either by any vitious Habit in particular, or by ſome perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indiſpoſition, and natural Defect. For the Eyes of the Mind are like thoſe of the Body; the viſive Faculty is formed with them, and inherent from the Beginning; and therefore the way of helping the Sight, is not to add any thing new, but to remove the Films that grow over the Pupil; as a Man wipes away the Duſt from a Looking-Glaſs, to make the Reflexion clear and ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> From this Repreſentation of the Caſe we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <note place="margin">Three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection.</note> that True Integrity may be diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts; The One Natural, eaſy, gentle, and even, which is properly called a Good Temper; The Other is acquired, full of difficulty, attained by labour and much pain, and This is termed Virtue; to both which we may add a Third, which is a kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the Two former, and ſo there will be Three Degrees of Perfection in the Caſe before us. The Firſt and Loweſt is an Eaſineſs of Temper, a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53648:342"/>Mind ſo well diſpoſed, as to have naturally and of its own accord, a diſreliſh and averſion to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Extravagance and Vice; and this we may call Goodneſs, or Innocence. The Second and next Stage, which we call Virtue, conſiſts in the Art and Labour of Prevention, ſetting it ſelf with all its Force and Vigour, to guard the Avenues, to hinder the Advances of Vice, and check the very firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Paſſions, when they grow mutinous; and if the Inſurrection be actually begun, to muſter and arm all a Man's Forces to ſtop, and quell, and reduce them. The Third and Higheſt degree of all is a Mixture of Noble Reſolution, and a Happy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo that the Man from both theſe met together, is ſo excellently well diſpoſed, as not only to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue impregnable, but to be free even from Attacks. Not ſo much as a Temptation riſes to give him Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the very Seeds of Vice are quite rooted out. Virtue is the only, the Natural Growth of this proſperous Soil; and becomes not the Habit, ſo much as the Complexion and Conſtitution of the Man. This Laſt may juſtly be ſtyled Perfection; This and the Firſt kind do thus far reſemble one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are both very differing from the Second; That they are ſilent and ſtill, without difficulty, and without ſtruggle, the natural Air, and conſtant Courſe of the Man, a cheap and eaſy Virtue, that coſts him little or nothing; whereas the Second is a perpetual Conflict, and dwells in the midſt of Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Alarms, and Battels. The laſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of theſe Degrees, is acquired by a long and painful Study, a ſerious and conſtant Exerciſe of the Rules of Philoſophy, added to a Good, and Generous, and Noble Nature, largely and liberally furniſhed; and a Mind enriched with all manner of good Diſpoſitions. For in this Caſe Both muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; Nature and Induſtry muſt each do their part; and it cannot be entirely the work of one of theſe,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53648:342"/>not all infuſed, nor all acquired. This is the End, which all the old Philoſophers propoſed to their Studies; but above all the reſt, the <hi>Stoick</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Sect, (I make no ſcruple of ſaying the latter did it as well as the former, though this I confeſs might ſeem ſtrange, had we not the Teſtimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and ſeveral other Ancient Writers in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it.) Theſe gallant Men look'd upon Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Contempt, Want and Sickneſs, Pains, and Tortures, nay even Death it ſelf, to be Toys and Trifles, fit for none but Fools and Children to be anxious or concerned about. They did not only deſpiſe them, and endure them with Patience and Conſtancy, and gain an abſolute Conqueſt over all the Troubles and Difficulties of them, whenever they made the Aſſault; but they went out into the Field, they ſought and provoked them, Rejoiced in, as well as Triumphed over them. They look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Encounters as neceſſary Breathings for their Virtue, to keep it in Exerciſe and Vigour; and by the frequency of ſuch Engagements, did not only ſecure and eſtabliſh that Virtue, and render it Firm, and Steady, and Severe, (as <hi>Cato</hi> and ſome other renowned Stoicks for inſtance did) but even Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Gay; and if that be not an improper expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wanton and full of play, by the perfect Maſtery they had got over all external Accidents and Things.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53648:343"/>the Doing Well, where it is without the expence of Trouble and Hazard, is look'd upon by theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as too vulgar and cheap a thing; but the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting and going through with it, in deſpight of Hazards and Troubleſome Oppoſitions, and where theſe attack us in great number, and labour hard to obſtruct, and deter us from our Duty; This is the Commendation of a Good, and a Virtuous Perſon indeed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Difficilia quae pulchra <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Whatever is excellent is Difficult,</hi> was, we know, the uſual Saying of the Nobleſt Philoſopher. But to deal plainly, and ſpeak the Truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Difficulty of obtaining any thing does by no means alter the nature, or add to the real and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick value of the thing it ſelf; nor is it, as I have taken occaſion formerly to obſerve, any juſt and warrantable Cauſe for raiſing it in our Eſteem. Nay it is beyond all Controverſy certain on the other ſide, that Natural Excellencies are much more deſirable, and better than thoſe that are ſtudied and acquired. That it is much more Brave, and Great, and Divine to act by the motions and ſpontaneous Perfections of Nature, than with the moſt exquiſite Dexterity and niceſt Improvements of Art; in an eaſy, free, equal, and uniform manner, than with laborious Efforts, uncertainly, and with Doubt, and Danger, and Perplexity of Thought. It is in the former of theſe two Senſes, that we term Almighty God Good, His Excellencies are his Nature, Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to him; and if They could ceaſe, he muſt ceaſe to Be. And therefore to call not Him only, but even the Bleſſed Angels, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, Virtuous; is a Diminution and Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them. Theirs is properly Goodneſs too, but Virtue is a Title too low for the Happineſs of unſinning Perfection, a State of Indefectibility,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53648:343"/>and above the reach of all Temptation. 'Tis true indeed, in the Condition we now live, where Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſurround, and threaten, and Frailties betray us perpetually; Virtue makes ſomewhat of noiſe and clutter, and is forced to act with ſome Vehemence; and this gives it the Preference before Smooth and Still Goodneſs. For the generality of people always meaſure the Excellence of a Thing by the Shew, and the Difficulty; and admire that moſt, which coſts deareſt; but this is a falſe method of judging; and we are not much to wonder, if They are wrong here, who indeed are generally ſo in all their Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Men and Things. For theſe great Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Performances, that look ſo big, and ſeem to be all zeal and fire, are not ſubſantial, nor to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; They are no part of true Honeſty, nor the Products of that fix'd Principle we are ſpeaking of; but rather intemperate Heats, and Feveriſh Fits, very different from that Wiſdom we are now in queſt of, which is healthful and moderate, gentle and calm, equal and uniform.</p>
                        <p>Thus much may ſuffice to be ſaid of Honeſty or Sincerity in general; For as to the ſeveral parts of it, and the particular Duties reſulting from thence, they will come under our Conſideration in the Third Book, and particularly, when we ſhall treat of the Virtue of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> And here I find my ſelf under an Obligation, of diſcharging my Promiſe,<note place="margin">Of Grace.</note> in the neceſſary Addition of what follows in this Paragraph. To ſilence (if it be poſſible) the unjuſt Malice, and diſadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Character caſt upon me by ſome who find fault with my (as they think them) Extravagant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of Nature; as if This were able to do every thing, and no other Aſſiſtances were required. To theſe perſons it might ſuffice to reply, that by <hi>Nature</hi> I underſtand (as was obſerved before) the God of Nature, and the Dictates of Eternal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53648:344"/>written and engraved in every Heart by His Almighty Hand. I might alſo alledge, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Book is only Natural, and Human; and that the Author is not obliged by his Deſign to concern himſelf with any Virtues properly Divine, or the Advantages above the power of Nature to confer. But waving all this, I readily acknowledge, that to render the Virtue and Integrity I have been deſcribing compleat, and give it all the Perfections it is capable of, one thing more is neceſſary: The <hi>Grace of God</hi> I mean; which muſt animate and invigorate this Goodneſs and Probity; ſhew it in all its luſtre; give the finiſhing ſtroke, refine and exalt it from a mere Moral to a Chriſtian Virtue. This renders it accepted at the Throne of Heaven, approved of God, capable of an Eternal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and ſo crowns it both with Perfection here, and a Reward hereafter. It is not eaſy to find Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Reſemblances for Things which cannot preſent themſelves to us by any ſenſible Ideas: But if you will pardon the meanneſs of the Compariſon, I ſhould almoſt venture, to compare the Probity here inſiſted on, to a Skilful Maſter, who touches the Keys of an Organ, with abſolute Accuracy and Art; but all to no purpoſe, the Inſtrument is dumb, till the Wind expreſs the Excellence of his Hand, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sound to the Inſtrument; and making that Melody, which all his Maſtery in playing was not able to do without it. Thus Moral Virtue is but a ſort of Speculative Perfection, till the Grace of God inſpire, and enable us to put it in Practice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Fruits of it.</p>
                        <p>Now This is a Bleſſing, which does not conſiſt in refined Thought, nice Notions, and long or learned Diſcourſes; it is not to be acquired by Rule, or the methods of Human Induſtry and Art, nor can we attain to it by our own Labour and Toil; the utmoſt we can do is to prepare, and endeavour to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53648:344"/>qualify our ſelves duly for the receiving it; for after All, Receive it we muſt; It is a Gift that comes down from on high, and the very Name of <hi>Grace</hi> is deſigned to repreſent to us the Good Will of the Donor, and that the Gift is entirely free. Our part is to ask, to ſeek, to implore it, with all imaginable Humility, and the moſt fervent Deſires we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. To proſtrate our ſelves before the Throne of Grace, and with the utmoſt Contention of Heart and Voice to ſay, <q>Vouchſafe, O my God, in thy Infinite Goodneſs to look down with an Eye of Mercy and Pity upon thy poor Servant; Accept and grant my Deſires, aſſiſt my weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and crown thoſe good Inclinations, which are originally derived from Thee: The Law by which I ſtand obliged, the Light by which I am inſtructed in my Duty, are of thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; thou haſt ſtamped our Nature with theſe Impreſſions of Good and Evil, and ſhined in our hearts by thy Precepts; O give Succeſs to thy own Inſtitution, and finiſh the work thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; that ſo the Glory and the Fruit may redound to the Planters uſe, and thou may'ſt be firſt and laſt in all my Actions and Deſigns, my Thoughts and my Deſires. Water me abundantly with thy Grace, and take me for thy own, that I who am of my ſelf miſerable, and poor, and naked, and blind, and weak, may be able to do even all things, through Chriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are proper Addreſſes upon ſuch an occaſion, but the propereſt and moſt probable method to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, that is, to incline the Compaſſion of God, and diſpoſe him to gratify ſuch Deſires, will be ſtrict Moral Honeſty, and a Conſcientious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law of Nature to the beſt of our power. For this, though it be not an abſolutely Meritorious Cauſe, is yet a Conditional one, and a good Preparation for the receiving Supernatural Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53648:345"/>as Matter ready diſpoſed is cloathed with the Form, and the Vegetative and Senſitive Soul deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Parents, lead the way, and put all things in readineſs, for the Acceſſion of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Intellectual one, which proceeds from God. Thus Human Wiſdom is the Introduction to Divine, Philoſophy the Handmaid to Religion, the Natural and Moral Duties of a Man ſubſervient and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Liberty of a Chriſtian, the Light, and Favour of the Children of God. He who does his beſt in the matters of Reaſon, and Morality, gives God an occaſion of exerciſing his Bounty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing larger and nobler Virtues upon him. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an equitable Method, and ſuch as our Bleſſed Saviour aſſures us, God himſelf proceeds by, to truſt that Man with more and greater Talents, who hath approved himſelf diligent and faithful in the good management of leſs. To this purpoſe are all thoſe Holy Aphoriſms. <hi>Thou haſt been faithful in a very little, be thou ruler over much. God giveth the Holy Spirit to all them that ask him. To Him that hath ſhall be given, and He ſhall have abundance. God denies no man Grace, who does his utmoſt. God is wanting to no Man in neceſſary Supplies;</hi> and the like.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, To live in Contradiction and Defiance to Men's Natural Light, is to put one's ſelf out of all Capacity of God's Favour, and, as much as in us lies, to make it impoſſible for Grace to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us. Since He, who gives it, hath expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared upon what Conditions Men are allowed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it; and if He exceeds thoſe Meaſures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it upon perſons wholly unqualified, This is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Common Method, and an excepted Caſe from his regular Diſpenſations. This obſtinacy and perverſeneſs is expreſly mentioned, as the Reaſon why our Saviour refuſed to preach in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places; and, ſince the Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St. <hi>Chry oſlem,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and other of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53648:345"/>have largely diſcourſed upon that matter to this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>By all which it appears evidently, that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> are not contrary Principles; for (in the Senſe I have all along uſed the Term in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) Grace is ſo far from forcing or deſtroying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is a gentle and ſeaſonable Relief to it; nay, it ſtrengthens, and crowns, and perfects Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We muſt not therefore ſet theſe two in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to each other, but join both together, and put on the One as the Ornament, the Fulneſs, and juſt Finiſhing of the Other. Both proceed from God, though after different manners; and therefore we muſt neither put them at variance, nor confound them for want of duly diſtinguiſhing them aſunder; for each hath its proper Springs, and peculiar Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They neither ſet out together, nor operate alike; though both came from the ſame place; and lead to the ſame End at laſt.</p>
                        <p>Nature may be without Grace, and when duly followed hath its commendation even then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe Circumſtances which admitted of no more. Thus it was with the Philoſophers and Great Men heretofore, Perſons whoſe Proficiency under this Firſt and General Law, and their Attainments in all ſorts of Moral Virtue, may be allowed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our Wonder, as well as challenge our Praiſe. Such likewiſe is the Caſe of all Infidels at this day; becauſe the Grace we ſpeak of is a Goſpel-Bleſſing, and They who are not under the Evangelical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, have no Title to it. But Grace cannot be without Nature; becauſe This is the Matter for it to work upon; for the buſineſs of Grace is to reform and perfect; and therefore This as neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Nature, as the raiſing of a Roof ſuppoſes a Foundation to be laid, and Walls already car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up. The Organiſt may exerciſe his Fingers, 'tis true, upon the dumb Keys, and make his Hand;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53648:346"/>but the Harmony muſt come from the Breath; or if it could ſound, yet would it be but like St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>tinkling Cymbal,</hi> of no worth or ſignificancy at all: But all the Air in the World will never make Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Inſtrument, without a Hand to ſtrike the Keys. In This I have been the more particular, and deſcended to familiar Compariſons, becauſe Some I find have ſuffered themſelves to be led into very groſs Miſtakes upon the matter. Perſons, who have never conceived a right and worthy Notion of that true Probity and entirely Honeſt Principle we have been recommending; but are blown up with ſtrange Romantick Conceits of Grace; which they doubt not to attain, and practiſe eminently well, without any regard to Morality; and by a Scheme of Phariſaical Accompliſhments; ſome eaſy, lazy, ſormal Performances, which carry a great appearance of Sanctity to the World; but as for the real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and inward Power of Goodneſs and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, they give themſelves no trouble at all about it. I ſee great ſtore of theſe Men in the World every day; but alas! I can find but very few ſuch as <hi>Ariſtides, Phocion, Cato, Regulus, Socrates;</hi> no <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minonda</hi>'s, no <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, no Strict and Conſcientious Profeſſors, I mean, of ſtanch and ſolid Virtue; and Philoſophical, or if you pleaſe, common Juſtice, and downright Moral Honeſty. The Reproaches and Complaints ſo liberally beſtowed by our Saviour upon the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and Hypocrites, will never be out of ſeaſon; for the perſons obnoxious to theſe always abound; and even thoſe who ſet up for the Great Cenſors of Manners, the Zealous Railers at Vice, and Grave Reformers of the World, are not all exempt from this Charge themſelves. But enough of this. I have ſpoken largely of the Virtue it ſelf; now before I cloſe this Chapter, I muſt take leave to add one word, concerning the diſpoſition of Mind contrary to it.</p>

                           <hi>Wickedneſs is ſaid to drink the greateſt part of its own Poyſon; the bitterneſs and the dregs fall to its own ſhare. Evil Counſel turns moſt to the prejudice of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that gives it.</hi> As the Waſp, though ſhe may hurt and occaſion ſome ſmart to the perſon ſtung by her,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53648:347"/>yet does it ſelf the greateſt harm; and ſuffers more by the loſs of its Sting, and being diſabled for ever after. It is true, Vice is attended with ſome Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for were there not this to recommend it, Wickedneſs would never find any entertainment in the World. No Man ever was, or can be vitious, merely for the ſake, or ſatisfaction of being ſo. But ſtill, when we have allowed this Advantage of a ſhort and ſenſible Satisfaction; yet we muſt not forget what follows, and how poor a buſineſs this is, in compariſon of that laſting Diſpleaſure, and Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it begets afterwards. So that, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays truly, The Puniſhment conſtantly follows the Sin; or rather indeed, as <hi>Heſiod</hi> yet more nicely obſerves, They are Twin-Children, and come into the World together. Now the Caſe of Virtue is juſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of This; It gratifies, and ſooths us; leaves ſweet and pleaſing Remembrances behind: Fills us with inward Complacencies, ſecret Congratulations of our own Happineſs, and inexpreſſible Satisfaction, in having done what becomes us. This is the true Reward of a virtuous Mind, a Happineſs inherent and Eſſential to it. And the Applauſes, and Joys, and Tranſports of a Good Conſcience, as they are ſure to us, and cannot be withheld by any who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy our Virtue, or our Fame; ſo are they likewiſe, ſo large, and full; ſo generous and noble, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as may very well encourage, and ſatisfy us, during our continuance in this preſent World.</p>

But ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may be made, whether we are obliged to be ſo general, and irreconcilable in our Hatred, that it ſhould be impoſſible for any Pleaſure or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſo deſirable to offer it ſelf, for the proſpect of which the committing of any Vice might not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, at leaſt excuſable in us. Many people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53648:347"/>are but too apt to think, that there are ſeveral ſuch reſerved Caſes, wherein the common Rules of Morality may be very fairly diſpenſed with. And, if we allow the Advantage to be publick, the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Politicks make no doubt of it, (provided the proceedings be ſo qualified, as I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to adviſe, when I come to treat of the Virtue of Prudence in point of Government.) But ſome have not been content to reſtrain this Liberty to the neceſſities of State; but have enlarged its bounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their juſt extent; and given the ſame Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Private Pleaſure and Profit of ſingle Men. Now This is a thing not poſſible to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in favour of their Aſſertion, without the Caſe were ſtated in all its Circumſtances; and both the Perſon, the Quality of the Fact, and the Nature of the Advantage propoſed, particularly ſpecified. But otherwiſe, while we treat of the Matter ſimply, and abſtractedly, it is a general Rule, not only in Religion, but in mere Morality too, That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of no Advantage or Pleaſure whatſoever, will juſtify a Man in doing any thing Ill in it ſelf, or which is contrary to his Duty and Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Again; It is paſt a doubt, <note place="margin">Whether all Sin beget Repentance.</note> that Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath it not in its power to furniſh out Pleaſures and Satisfactions ſo ſolid and agreeable, as Virtue and the Conſciouſneſs of one's own Sincerity, is able and wont to do; nay, it is moſt certain, that Vices are their own Tormentors, and execute ſevere Vengeance upon the Authors. But yet this is not univerſally, and in all Caſes true; and therefore it is neceſſary to make ſome diſtinction of Perſons and Circumſtances. Now Wickedneſs, and Wicked Men may be diſtributed into three ſorts. Some, <hi>firſt,</hi> are perfectly incorporated with Evil, they Reaſon themſelves into it; their Reſolutions and the whole Bent of their Wills are fixed entirely in its Intereſts; or elſe long Cuſtom hath got ſuch a perfect Maſtery
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53648:348"/>over them, that they cannot Diſengage themſelves. Theſe miſerable Wretches are utterly abandoned; their very Underſtanding is vitiated, ſees, conſents to, and approves the Evil: And This uſually is the Caſe, when Vice and Debauchery meets with a Strong and Vigorous Mind, and hath taken ſuch deep root in it, that it comes at laſt to be naturalized, and of a piece with it; all the Faculties are tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is corrupted throughout, and Vice ſo cloſely interwoven, as to become a part of its Temper and Conſtitution. Others, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> have their Intervals of Folly only; They are wicked now and then by fits, juſt as any violent Guſh of a Temptation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs or puts them out of their Courſe; or ſome impetuous Paſſion drives them headlong upon the Rocks; ſo that theſe Men are ſurprized, and carried away forcibly, by a Current too ſtrong for them to ſtem. The <hi>Third</hi> ſort are betwixt theſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes: They have a right Notion of Vice, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in it ſelf; and when they reflect upon their Fault abſtractedly, do ſeverely accuſe and condemn themſelves for it; and thus they differ from the Firſt Sort, who are advanced even to the deſperate degree of a good liking of Wickedneſs: But then they have not the violence or ſurprize of Paſſions or Temptations to qualify and extenuate their Crime; and in this reſpect they differ from the Second ſort too. But theſe Men go to work in cold blood, and with great deliberation; they weigh Circumſtances, and drive a Bargain as it were; obſerve well the Heinouſneſs of the Sin; and then put the Pleaſure or Profit it brings, into the contrary Scale; and thus they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter away their Souls, and are content to be wicked at a certain Price, and for ſuch as they think a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Conſideration. They lend themſelves to the Devil, for ſo much Intereſt to be paid for the uſe of their Perſons; and are ſo fooliſh to think, that there is a great deal to be ſaid, in excuſe for ſuch a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53648:348"/>Commerce as this. Of this kind we may reckon Extortion, and Oppreſſion, and Covetouſneſs for Gain; and the Exceſſes and Debaucheries of Wine and Women for the ſake of Pleaſure; and indeed ſeveral other Sins committed upon occaſions, though they be not reigning and habitual; ſuch as Men think, and conſult upon, and at laſt reſolve wrong; where the Will is manifeſtly concerned, or where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Man is apt, againſt his Reaſon and better Senſe, to determine him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Now the Firſt of theſe Three ſorts are paſt repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ordinary Means, <note place="margin">Theſe Thr comparea.</note> and nothing leſs than an unuſual, and almoſt miraculous Impreſſion from Heaven can be ſuppoſed to reclaim them. For <hi>they are</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and <hi>commit</hi> evil even <hi>with Greedineſs.</hi> The Stings and Prickings of Wickedneſs are very ſharp and piercing indeed, but theſe Men's Conſciences are ſo tough and harden'd, that nothing can enter them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, The Underſtanding, as was obſerved, is brought over to an Approbation of the thing; and ſo all Senſe of Remorſe muſt be loſt, which proceeds chiefly from acting againſt our better Judgment; The Soul is entirely corrupted, the Diſtinctions of Good and Evil obliterated and worn away; and conſequently the Will can be under no ſollicitude to reſtrain, or refuſe. The Third ſort of Men, though they may appear in ſome meaſure to repent, and condemn themſelves, yet in reality, and properly ſpeaking, they do not. Take the Fact by it ſelf, as a matter unlawful and unbecoming, and ſo they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow it; but view it dreſt up in all its gay Attire, with all the Circumſtances of Pleaſure and Profit, that recommend, and ſet it off, and you ſhall find them of another Opinion. They think the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Sin, a ſufficient Compenſation for the Guilt; and cannot be ſaid to repent of That, which had the full and free Conſent of their Reaſon and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53648:349"/>Conſcience; and with which they are always ready to cloſe, as often as it ſhall proffer it ſelf upon the ſame Terms. So that in Truth the Second ſort ſeem to be the only perſons, that are ſeriouſly concerned to repent, and reform. And ſince we are now upon the mention of Repentance, I ſhall take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſay one word upon that Subject.</p>

                           <hi>Repentance,</hi> is a Diſpoſition, or rather an Act of the Will,<note place="margin">Repentance.</note> whereby the Man diſclaims, and ſo far as in him lies, undoes again what he had done before. It is a Grief and Sadneſs of Heart, but differing in this one reſpect from all other Pains and Paſſions of that kind, ariſing from external Cauſes, That Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon begets, and heightens This, whereas it mitigates and expels Thoſe. Repentance is wholly internal; the Ground and Foundation of it is from within, and upon that account it is more violent than any other: As the Cold of Agues and Heat of Fevers is more fierce and inſupportable to the Patient, than any, which is ever occaſioned by Objects from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Repentance is the Phyſick of the Soul; the Death of Vice; the only Health of Wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and Depraved Wills. But though all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt agree in the Excellent Effects and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the thing, yet many miſtake it; and therefore good care ſhould be taken to diſtinguiſh aright, and be perfectly informed in this matter. As Firſt; There are ſome ſorts of ſin, of which Men very hardly, and ſeldom repent; as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved juſt now concerning old inveterate Vices, ſuch as Cuſtom hath made in a manner natural and neceſſary, and the Corruption of the Judgment hath given Authority to, by determining in their Favour. For while a Man continues under the power of ſuch Habits, and the Blindneſs of ſuch an erroneous Choice; the ſenſe of his Mind is with him; and he feels no Check or Reluctancy at all; ſo that Repentance, which implies ſuch Regret, is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53648:349"/>(uſually ſpeaking) terminated in Accidental and Occaſional Miſcarriages; the ſudden and ſurprizing Faults, where there is not leiſure for Deliberation to interpoſe; or the Violent Sallies of Paſſion, where the Judgment is over-power'd, and under ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to do amiſs. Another ſort of things there are, which a Man cannot be ſaid with any Truth or Propriety of Speech to repent of; and thoſe are, Such as are out of a Man's own Power: At theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we may conceive a Juſt Indignation, or be much concerned, and extremely ſorry for them; but we cannot be ſaid to Repent of them, becauſe This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not only Sorrow, but the blaming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our ſelves, and failing in what we might have done better. Nor does That diſpleaſure of Mind deſerve this Name, which proceeds from the diſappointment of our Expectations, or Events con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Wiſhes and Intentions. We laid, as we thought, a very wiſe Project, and had a very fair proſpect of Succeſs; but Matters have happen'd quite otherwiſe, than we imagined it likely or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to do; and ſome unforeſeen Accident ſteps in betwixt, and blaſts the whole Deſign. Now pray, What is all this to the Matter in hand? or what ground can here poſſibly be for Repentance? The Deſign, and the Method, were well and juſtly contrived; every wiſe and good Man would have taken the ſame Courſe. You have done your Duty; but you have not ſucceeded in it. And is that any fault of Yours? You adviſed well, and proceeded regularly; and this is the utmoſt Man can do. For we can neither command Events, nor have any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive knowledge before-hand what they will be. The Uncertainty of the Iſſue is the foundation of all Prudence and good Conduct, for were This ſixt and foreknown, no place could be left for Deliberation and Management; And therefore there is not a greater weakneſs, nor a more unreaſonable pretence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53648:350"/>in the world, either for tormenting our ſelves, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining meaner thoughts of others, than Want of Succeſs. Advice, and Conduct are by no means to be judged by the Event; for there is an unſeen, and an unaccountable Providence, that directs all the Chances, that ſometimes defeats the wiſeſt, and proſpers the weakeſt and moſt unpromiſing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Undertakings. Again; Repentance is not, as ſome fondly ſuppoſe, that Change of Mind, which proceeds from Old Age, Impotence, want of Opportunity, or want of Inclination, or any ſuch Diſreliſh, as either Satiety and Exceſs, or a natural Alteration of Palate, brings upon us. For there is a mighty Diſſerence between forſaking Vice, and being forſaken of it; between denying our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites when they are keen and eager; and gratifying them by a pleaſing Abſtinence from what they are cloyed with already. Beſides, To like any thing the worſe upon theſe accounts, is really a Corruption of, and a Reflection upon our Judgment. For the things are ſtill the ſame; the ſame Approbation, or the ſame Diſlike, was due to them heretofore, no leſs than now; All the Change is in our Selves only, and that too is a Change in no degree voluntary or choſen, but purely neceſſary or accidental, the effect of Age or Sickneſs. We ſpeak moſt improperly, when we ſay that a Man is grown wiſer or better in ſuch caſes; for all the Reformation, that proceeds from humour or diſcontent; from diſreliſh or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability; is Fear, and Phlegm, Coldneſs, and Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs. There is oftentimes not the leaſt of Real Conviction, or any Principle of Conſcience in it. And ſure a feeble Body is a very unfit Conveyance, to carry us to God, and drive us to Repentance and our Duty. For true Repentance is ſomewhat very different from all this; it is a particular Gift of God, by which we grow wiſe in good earneſt; a Remorſe, which checks our hotteſt Career, even in the midſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53648:350"/>of Springhtlineſs and Courage; and this is what muſt be created and cheriſhed in us, not by the want of opportunities, or of power to uſe them, not by the weakneſs of a Body broken, and worn out, and grown unſerviceable to Vice any longer; but by the Strength of Reaſon and Thought, and the better conſideration of a Reſolute and Vigorous Mind. For nothing more argues Greatneſs of Soul, than the Correcting our former Follies, and Steadineſs in a new Courſe of Life; notwithſtanding all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Diſcouragements of an entire Reformation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Now One fruit of true Repentance, is a frank, and conſcientious Confeſſion of one's Faults;<note place="margin">Of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Excuſing Faults.</note> This is uſually the Sign, the Conſequence, and in ſome Caſes ſo neceſſary a Qualification, that all Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Penitence without it are Hypocritical and vain. It is with the Mind in theſe Reſpects, as with our Bodies. For, as in Bodily Diſtempers there are two ſorts of Remedies made uſe of, One, that make a perfect Cure, by going to the very Root, and removing the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; Another, which only ſooth the Patient, conſult his preſent Eaſe; and are properly termed Quieting Medicines; and, as in this caſe, that former Application is much more painful, but withal more powerful and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and better for the perſon, than the latter; So likewiſe in the Wounds and Sickneſſes of the Soul, the true Remedy is of a ſearching and a cleanſing quality; and This is ſuch an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Faults, as is full of Seriouſneſs and Shame; a being content to take the Scandal, and the Folly of them upon our ſelves. But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceitful Remedy, which only covers, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes them; its deſign is not to heal, ſo much as to conceal the Diſeaſe; and this conſiſts in Extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Excuſes; from whence we commonly ſay, That <hi>Wickedneſs makes it ſelf a Garment, to cover its own Shame.</hi> This is a Remedy invented by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53648:351"/>of Evil himſelf; and it anſwers the Malice of his Nature and his purpoſes, by rendring the Party ſo much the worſe, and obſtructing the Methods of his Recovery. Such were the Shifts, and Shufflings, ſuch the Covering of their Nakedneſs, which the Firſt Tranſgreſſors made; the Fig-leaves and the Excuſes were both alike, and made the Matter but ſo much the worſe, while they laboured to mend it.</p>
                        <p>We ſhould therefore by all means learn to accuſe our ſelves; and get that neceſſary Conqueſt over our Pride and Self-love, as frankly and fully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the very worſt of our Thoughts and Actions, and not allow our ſelves in any reſerves of this kind. For, beſides, that this would beget a brave and generous Openneſs of Soul; it would likewiſe be a wonderful Check, and effectual Preſervative, againſt all ſuch Actions and Thoughts, as are not fit to be publickly known, and what a Man would be aſhamed of, if they were ſo. For He that obliges himſelf to tell all he does, will be ſure to take care not to do any thing which ſhall need to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. But alas! the Common Practice of this naughty World is the direct contrary to the Advice I am giving. Every Man is diſcreet, and modeſt, and ſecret in the Confeſſing; but bold, and free from all reſtraint, in the Committing part. For as indeed the Confidence and Hardineſs of the Crime, would be very much curbed and abated; ſo likewiſe would it be in ſome meaſure compenſated, by an equal frankneſs and hardineſs in the accuſing of our Selves, and acknowledging what we have done amiſs. For whatever Indecency there may be in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ill thing, not to dare to confeſs our ſelves in the wrong, is ten thouſand times more odious and baſe. To this purpoſe we may obſerve, that there are ſeveral Inſtances of Perſons eminent for Piety, and Learning; ſuch as St. <hi>Auguſtin, Origen, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and the like; who have taken pains to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53648:351"/>the World, and to publiſh Books, wherein they confeſs and retract their own Miſtakes and erroneous Opinions; and well were it, if People could be brought to ſuch a Degree of Sincerity, as to do the ſame in point of Morals, and Misbehaviour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, they oftentimes incur a greater Guilt, by endeavouring to hide and ſmother a leſs; for a publick premeditated Lye ſeems to Carry ſome Aggravations along with it, which render it more abominable and more Vicious, than ſome other Facts commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſecret; though theſe be ſuch as in their own Nature, are apt to raiſe a greater Abhorrence and Deteſtation in us. All This does but inflame the Reckoning; it either makes the firſt Fault worſe, or adds a freſh one to it; and in either caſe the Guilt of the Man is not abated, but increaſed; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we count this Increaſe by way of Addition, or of Multiplication, the Matter comes all to one.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53648:352"/>upon, and Drawing out to one's ſelf ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Method or Courſe of Life, that we may not live at large, and at random; but betake our ſelves to ſome particular ſort of Buſineſs, or Profeſſion, which may be proper and convenient for us. My meaning is, ſuch as a Man's own Temper and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſpoſition qualifies him for, and applies it ſelf chearfully to; (with this Caution only, that, while we follow our own Nature in particular, there be a conſtant Regard had to the Dictates of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general, which is and ought to be the Great, the General, the Governing Miſtreſs of us all, as you were told in the laſt Chapter.)

                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:53648:352"/>
                     <p> Others again are in the contrary Extreme, the moſt unhappy and ill-ſuited with their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that can poſſibly be imagined. They made a falſe Step at firſt, and have never been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve it ſince. Either they wanted the Judgment to know themſelves, or the diligence and care which was neceſſary, to take right Meaſures, or to think better, and knock off in time, when they found they had taken wrong. For the beſt thing left for Them to do, had been to recede quietly; whereas for want of this prudent retiring, they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afterwards engaged too far, and beyond all poſſibility of a Retreat. Which being now cut off, they are forced to drudge on, through infinite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; and lead a Life made up of nothing elſe, but Trouble and Conſtraint, Repentance and Diſcontents.</p>
                     <p>But then This frequently happens too, from ſome failure in the perſon, that deliberates about it, and conſiders amiſs; as well as from the Ignorance or the Raſhneſs, of ſuch as conſider very little, or not at all. And That may be, from a Man's miſtaking his own Genius, or Capacity; and thinking too highly of his own Abilities. And when upon theſe falſe Preſumptions he hath undertaken any thing above his management, the Conſequence of it is; Either to lay it down again with Diſgrace; Or elſe to live in perpetual pain, and torment, by obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in an Attempt too much for him. We ſhould always remember, that he that lifts a Burden, muſt be ſtronger than his Burden; for elſe there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but he muſt let alone, what he cannot carry; or ſink under the weight of it. And a wiſe Man will always be Maſter of his own Buſineſs, and not undertake more than it is poſſible for him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another Obſtruction of this kind, no leſs common and fatal, than the Former; which is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53648:353"/>a ſtrange Levity of Temper, that never ſticks to any thing, but is every day forming ſome new Project; Thus we ſee abundance of People that are never pleaſed or ſatisfied with any thing; every thing gives them uneaſineſs and diſcontent; Tired of Buſineſs, and Sick of Leiſure; Governing and being Governed makes them equally reſtleſs, and they can neither lead nor follow quietly. Such Creatures as theſe are doom'd to Wretchedneſs irrecoverable; for they are always under Conſtraint, and Miſery; every thing they do is grievous, and againſt the grain: And, which adds yet more to their Unhappineſs, they can never reſt in quiet, but are always in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and buſtle, and all the while without any deſign; conſtantly buſy, and nothing done; Whereas the Actions of a wiſe Man have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Aim, to direct and determine them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnam rem puta unum hominem agere; praeter ſapientem nemo unum agit, multiformes ſumus.</note> 
                        <hi>And you muſt know 'tis no ſmall commendation for a Man to be conſtantly the ſame; for all of us are of a thouſand different forms and ſhapes, and none but the Wiſe Man is all of a piece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the grater part of Mankind never beſtow any ſerious thought upon the matter; and if you ask why they are of this Profeſſion rather than any other, the only account they are able to give is, that their Father was of it, or that they took a ſudden fancy to it; they are carried by Inſtinct, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, their own blind inclination, or the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Friends and Relations. And as they enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it without Thinking, ſo they are at a loſs how to diſengage again.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now in order to a Man's managing himſelf in this Affair as he ought; that both his Choice may be wiſely mae, and the Diſcharge of the Employment
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53648:353"/>he hath choſen, may prove ſucceſsful; there are Two things which require a very particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and theſe are, The true Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, both of Himſelf, and of his Buſineſs.
<list>
                           <item>1. Firſt, It is abſolutely requiſite, he ſhould be perfectly well acquainted with his own Mind; the Conſtitution, Inclination, Capacity, and Temper of Soul and Body both; Wherein it is, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency lies; and Which are his weak and blind Sides: What he is qualified for, and of What he is uncapable, or leſs diſpoſed to. For a Man that goes againſt Nature, does in effect tempt God, and bid defiance to Providence; he cuts himſelf out a great deal of work, which he can never finiſh; and by breaking that known Rule, of<note n="†" place="bottom">Nec quidquam ſequi quod aſſequi nequeas.</note> 
                              <hi>attempting nothing which we cannot maſter;</hi> expoſes himſelf to Scorn and Deriſion, and becomes the Jeſt of all that know him.</item>
                           <item>2. After this Knowledge of himſelf, it is, in the next place, as neceſſary, that he ſhould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Buſineſs; that is, with That Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Truſt, or particular Condition of Life, which he propoſes to fix in. For there are ſome Profeſſions incumbred with Matters of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; Others of vaſt importance; a Third ſort, that expoſe us to Danger; and a Fourth, where the Buſineſs, though it be not of any mighty Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is yet extremely intricate and perplexed; and involves a Man in a world of Trouble and Care, and other Affairs that depend upon, or are interwoven with it. Now all Employments of this Nature do greatly haraſs and fatigue the Mind; and keep one's Thoughts always buſy and bent. Beſides, As the Buſineſs of each Profeſſion differs from the reſt, ſo do the Faculties and Parts, that qualify Men
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53648:354"/>for it. One requires Acuracy of Judgment; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Livelineſs of Imagination; a Third, Strength of Memory; and a Man may be very eminent and commendable in himſelf; and yet ſpoil all, by being in a wrong way. Now what hath been formerly obſerved in the firſt Book, concerning the Parts and Faculties of the Mind in general, and the differing Temperaments of the Brain, may, I preſume, be of ſome uſe in this point; and, if judiciouſly applied, aſſiſt and direct Men toward the underſtanding, both the Nature of each Profeſſion, and Courſe of Life; and their own Fitneſs or Incapacity for it. For by examining firſt their own Diſpoſition, and then the State of Life they have thoughts of, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting, and comparing theſe two together, they will ſoon diſcern, whether theſe will ever hit it, and agree long with each other; for agree they muſt, or no Good can be done: This will quickly ſhew Men, what they are to truſt to. For if it happen, that a Man be obliged to ſtruggle with his own Inclination, and muſt conquer, and commit a violence upon his Nature, to make it ſerviceable to his purpoſe, and capable of diſcharging the Employment he hath taken upon him; Or on the other hand; if in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Nature, and to gratify our Inclination, we are, either with our own conſent, or inſenſibly and againſt our Wills, trapann'd into a Courſe, that falls ſhort of our Duty, or runs counter to it; what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Confuſion and Diſorder muſt here needs be? How can we ever expect Evenneſs, under ſo much Force? Conſtancy from ſo much Conſtraint, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum where every thing is againſt the Grain? For as is well oberved;<note n="*" place="bottom">Si quicquam decoium, nihil profecto magis, quam aequabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas Vitae univerſae &amp; ſingularum actionum; quam conſervare non poſſis, ſi aliorum imitans Naturam, omittas tuam.</note> 
                              <hi>If there be ſuch a thing as Decency
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53648:354"/>in the world, it is ſeen in nothing more than in an eaſineſs and conſiſtency both of one's whole life in general, and of each particular Action in it.

And here the Firſt, both in Order and Dignity, which offers it ſelf to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, concerns true Religion, and the Service of Almighty God. For certainly Piety ought to have the precedence of all Virtues, and is the higheſt and moſt honourable in the Scale of Duties; But the greater and more important it is, the more we are concerned to have a right notion of it; eſpecially, when to the inſinite conſequence of the thing, we add the danger of being miſtaken, and withal, how very common and eaſy it is, to deceive our ſelves in this point.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53648:355"/>how the Man, who makes Wiſdom his Aim and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ought to manage himſelf upon this weighty occaſion. And the giving Directions of this nature is the deſign of my preſent Diſcourſe; after I have firſt made a ſhort Digreſſion concerning the State and Succeſs of ſeveral ſorts of Religion in the World. Of which I ſhall chuſe to ſpeak but briefly here, and refer my Reader for farther Satisfaction, to what I have ſaid more at large to this purpoſe, in another Treatiſe of mine, called the <hi>Three Truths.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt of all, <note place="margin">Difference of Religions.</note> I cannot but take notice, how diſmal and deplorable a thing, the great Variety of Relgions is, which either now do, or formerly have obtained in the World. And, which is yet a greater misfortune and reproach, the Oddneſs of ſome of them; Opinions and Rites, ſo fantaſtical, ſo exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, that it is juſt matter of wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which way the Mind of Man could ſo far degenerate into Brutality, and be ſo miſerably beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Frauds and Folly. For upon examination it will appear, that there is ſcarce any one thing ſo high or ſo low, but it hath been Deified; and even the vileſt and moſt contemptible parts of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have, in ſome quarter of the World or other, found People blind enough to pay them Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Adoration.</p>
                        <p>Now, notwithſtanding this Difference be really as vaſt, and as horrid, as I have intimated, or my Reader can imagine; yet there ſeem to be ſome Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Points in common, which, like Principles or Fundamentals, are ſuch, as Moſt, if not All of them have agreed in. For however they may wander from one another, and take different Paths after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet they ſet out alike, and walk hand in hand for ſome Conſiderable Time. At leaſt they appear, and affect to do ſo; the Devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light; and undermining the Truth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53648:356"/>by Mimicking it; as knowing that the moſt effectual Art to ſeduce Men is by contriving fair and plauſible Lies; and dreſſing up Wickedneſs in its moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Attire. To this purpoſe it is obſervable, that the moſt prevailing Perſuaſions have ſprung from the ſame Climate, and firſt drew breath in almoſt the ſame Air. <hi>Paleſtine</hi> I mean and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which are Countries contiguous to one another. Some of their Firſt and main Principles are very near alike; ſuch as the Belief of one God, the Maker and Governor of all things; All own the Providence of God, and his Particular Love and Favour for Mankind; the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul; a Reward in Reſerve for the Good; and terrible Puniſhments, which await the Wicked, even after this Life; ſome particular Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſet Form of Solemn and External Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by which they put up their prayers, invoke the Name of God, and think that a decent Honour, and acceptable Service and Homage is paid to the Divine Majeſty by ſo doing. To give theſe a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Countenance and greater Authority in the World, ſome of them really produce, and others pretend Revelations, Viſions, Propheſies, Miracles, Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; Holy Myſteries, and eminent Examples of Saints, Perſons exemplary for their Piety, or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or Doctrine; and theſe Allegations, whether true or falſe, ſpeak the General and Natural Senſe of Mankind to agree in the expectations of Revelation from Heaven, and that Miracles are proper Atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them. Each hath a particular Scheme of its own, which diſtinguiſhes the Receivers of it from Thoſe of different Perſwaſions, and impoſes certain Articles of Faith and Forms of Diſcipline; Some as Terms of Communion, and Marks of Diſtinction, and Others as neceſſary to be believ'd in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All of them have at firſt been weak, and low, and little regarded; but from thoſe ſlender Beginnings have by degrees gained ground upon the People,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53648:356"/>been inſinuated, received, applauded, and at laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubmitted to, by vaſt Multitudes; ſpread far and wide, and eſtabliſhed themſelves; as if Opinions ran like contagious Diſeaſes, and all that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Air of them, were ſure to catch the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet ſome of theſe owe all their Authority to Fictions and Tricks; inſomuch that even the abſurdeſt and moſt ſenſleſs of all Errors, have been embraced with as great Reverence and Devotion, and maintained with as much Stiffneſs and as Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Confidence, as the very Truth it ſelf. All of them do likewiſe agree in their Notions of Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God; and teach unanimouſly that Prayers, and Offerings, Promiſes and Vows, Days of Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Humiliation and Thankſgiving, are proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to incline his Ear, and obtain his Favour and good Acceptance for our Perſons and our Requeſts; All believe, that the Principal and moſt pleaſing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we can pay to God, the moſt powerful means o averting his Indignation, reconciling our ſelves, and becoming agreeable to him, is by giving one's ſelf ſome torment and trouble; by laying heavy Burdens upon our ſelves, and cutting out a great deal of work, the more difficult and contrary to our inclination, the better, and more meritorious. For what other account but this, can we give of thoſe infinite Profeſs'd Auſterities enjoin'd to particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the abundance of Fraternities, and Societies of Men, which in all Religions throughout the World, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> as well as Chriſtian, are devoted to ſundry peculiar Exerciſes, full of Severity, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; of Poverty and Pain; and Corporal Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; even ſo far in ſome of them, as to ſcourge, and wound, and mangle their own Perſons? Theſe are obſerved to be more numerous, and differently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in Falſe Religions, than the True: And All this, from a ſtrong perſuaſion, that they merit by this Diſcipline and voluntary Cruelty; and are in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53648:357"/>proportion ſo much better Men than Others, as they afflict and torment themſelves more than They. An Imagination, which ſtill prevails, and ſuch as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature is never like to get quit of; for we ſee every day freſh Inſtances, and new Inventions of this kind, and what induſtry Men uſe to be more ingenious and exquiſite, in contriving new ſorts of mortification and puniſhment.<note place="margin">See the <hi>Notes.</hi>
                           </note> Now all this, I ſay, can be accounted for no other way, than by aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to an Opinion, that God takes delight, and is wonderfully pleaſed with the Sufferings and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of his Creatures: An Imagination, which to thoſe who think Sacrifices to have been of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Invention, ſeems to have been the Ground of all that way of Worſhip, which, before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion made its Appearance in the world, was univerſally practiſed. Thus harmleſs Beaſts were butchered every where, and their Blood ſpilt, and poured out upon Altars, as a valuable Preſent to the Divinity; and thus too in ſome places (ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was the Infatuation of Mankind) poor little innocent Children were barbarouſly tortured and murdered; and Grown Perſons, ſometimes Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and ſometimes Men of eminent Virtue and clear Reputation, were offered in Sacrifice; and this was the uſual Worſhip of almoſt all Nations, and looked upon, as one of the moſt ſolemn, and moſt acceptable Acts of Devotion. Thus the Old <hi>Getae</hi> in <hi>Scythia</hi> are ſaid, among other inſtances of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Honour paid to their God <hi>Zamolxis,</hi> to diſpatch a Man to him once in five years, to conſult and ſupplicate him in all things neceſſary for them. And, becauſe the Ceremony requires, that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of theirs ſhould dye in an inſtant, and the manner of expoſing him to death, (which is the being pierced through with three Javelins) is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtful in the Execution; therefore it often happens, that ſeveral are thus diſpatched, before any
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53648:357"/>one wounds himſelf in a part ſo mortal, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire immediately; and only He that does ſo, is eſteemed a Favourite of their God, and proper for that purpoſe; but all the reſt who dye ſlowly, are to be rejected, as unfit for this Sacrifice. Thus did the <hi>Perſians</hi> worſhip their Gods; as that ſingle fact of <hi>Ameſtris,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> teſtifies; who, in agreement to the Principles of Religion then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in that Country, did, as an Offering of Thanks for her own long and proſperous Life, bury fourteen young Perſons of Quality alive, Branches of the Nobleſt Families in the whole Kingdom. So likewiſe did the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> among whom young Children were Sacrificed to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and that with ſo remorſleſs a Zeal, that even the Fathers and Mothers uſed to be preſent, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting at the Ceremony. Thus the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſought to ingratiate themſelves with their Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> by ſcourging their young Men in Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to her; nay, doing it with ſuch Rigor, that they expired under it; for the Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> ſhews, that ſhe was worſhipped with human Blood. The Inſtance of the two <hi>Decij</hi> proves, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were poſſeſt with the ſame Imagination too; which gave occaſion for this Reflection in one of their Writers;<note n="*" place="bottom">Quae fuit tanta iniquitas Deorum, ut placati Pop. Rom. non poſſint, niſi tales viri occidiſſent?</note> 
                           <hi>What ſtrange Provocation could make the Gods ſo extremely hard and ſevere, that there was no way of reconciling them to the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>unleſs the Atonement were made by the blood of ſuch gallant Men?</hi> Thus, the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who ſlaſh and cut their Faces, their Breaſts, and other amembers, to recommend themſelves to their Prophet; and the people in our new Diſcoveries of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and at <hi>Themiſtitan,</hi> where they cement the Images of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53648:358"/>Gods, with Children's Blood. Now what Madneſs, what Stupidity is this, to ſuppoſe, that Inhuman Actions can ever gain upon the Divine Nature; that the Goodneſs of God is requited, or decently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by our own Sufferings; or that Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be a proper Method of ſatisfying his angry Juſtice? As if Juſtice could thirſt after human Blood, or feaſt it ſelf upon the Innocent lives, that are ſpilt with infinite torture, and the moſt exquiſite pain.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ut ſic Dij placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What can be more impious or extravagant, and how monſtrous a Being does ſuch a Belief as This, make of God?

With regard to Theſe it is, that the Men of every Religion prefer themſelves above all the World beſides; that they afirm, with great aſſurance, their own Perſuaſion to be the beſt, the pureſt, the moſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53648:358"/>Orthodox of any; and, as another means of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themſelves, are eternally reproaching thoſe that differ from them, with Errors and Corruptions; and by this means they are eternally employed too in creating Breaches, or in widening and keeping open ſuch as are already made; by the mutual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance and Condemnation, which every Party is perpetually declaring againſt the Notions of every other Party; and repreſenting all Syſtems, but their own, to be falſe and dangerous, and by no means to be admitted.</p>

Our Religion having the Advantages of all others, both in point of Authentick and unqueſtionable Teſtimony, and in other Excellencies peculiar to it ſelf. This I have demonſtrated at large in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of my Three Truths, and ſhewed the manifeſt Preeminence due to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now One thing is very worthy our Obſervation in this general Strife; <note place="margin">The later are built upon the former and more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> and That is the Advantage, which Time and Succeſſion have given in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For we ſhall find, that in proportion as One Religion hath been of a later date than another, ſo it hath gained ſomewhat from that which came into the World before it, and the Younger hath always built and raiſed it ſelf upon the Elder; more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon that, which was next of all before it in Order and Time. And the method of effecting this hath been, not by diſproving or exploding all that went before in the groſs and at once; for upon theſe terms it could never have found entertainment, or got any manner of Footing with people ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed; but the Courſe hath been, to accuſe what was formerly received, of ſome defect or Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; alledging that the Inſtitution was imperfect in it ſelf; or that it was only Temporary; and the Term, for which it was calculated, then expired;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53648:359"/>and therefore this New Additional one was neceſſary to ſucceed in the place of an aboliſhed, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat an unfiniſhed Religion. And thus by degrees the new one riſes upon the Ruins of the Old, and is enriched by the Spoils of its vanquiſh'd Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; As we know the caſe hath plainly ſtood with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, when it prevailed over the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> way of Worſhip; the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not being to be brought off from the Cuſtoms of that Country all at once: And afterwards the Chriſtian Faith and Promiſes, when they triumphed over the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Privileges and <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpenſation; and ſince that, the ſame Pretence hath been made uſe of to advance <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian Religion taken together. Each of theſe hath retained ſomething of the Religion it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſpoſſeſs; and built upon Old Foundations: But none ſo much as the <hi>Mahometan;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to perſiſt, and be fully perſuaded in All the Doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt, ſave only that Great and moſt important one, which aſſerts his Divinity. So that he who would paſs from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to <hi>Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> muſt take Chriſtianity in his way. And we are told, there have been ſome <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who have expoſed themſelves to Sufferings and Torture, in defence of the Chriſtian Truths; as a Chriſtian likewiſe upon his own Principles would be bound to do, in vindication of the Authority, and Doctrines of the Old Teſtament. But now if we caſt our Eyes upon the more Ancient ſort of Inſtitutions, we ſhall find them dealing after a very different manner with the New, which (as I ſaid) in part allow, and only profeſs to improve and refine upon Them. For They reject and condemn Them intirely, give them no quarter, but cry out upon them for Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and look upon every thing of later date than themſelves, as a mortal and irreconcilable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Truth; as if after the Period of their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53648:359"/>own Eſtabliſhment, Time could from thenceforth produce none but monſtrous Births; and all, who did not ſit down and ſtick there, muſt be inevitably abandoned to Falſhood and Corruption.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> This I think may be farther affirmed to be a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification common to all Religions whatſoever; <note place="margin">All of them uncouth to Nature.</note> that they are, every one, in Some Points uncouth and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign from the Common Senſe and apprehenſions of Mankind. And the Reaſon ſeems to be, that They all of them propound to our Conſideration and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and are Syſtems conſiſting of, and built upon, Points of a very diſtant kind from Common Senſe. For Some of them, when weighed in the Balance of human Judgment, appear to be exceeding mean, and low, and contemptible; ſuch as a Man of Wit, and Vigorous Thought, finds himſelf rather tempted to ridicule and expoſe, than to pay any Reverence to them: And Others again are ſo exceeding ſublime, the Luſtre of them ſo ſtrong, the Nature of them ſo full of Miracle and Myſtery, that, as Finite Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could never effect, ſo finite Underſtandings can never comprehend them fully; and at Theſe the Men of Diſcourſe and Demonſtration take offence, and will allow nothing to be credible, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. Whereas in Truth, the Sphere in which the human Intellect moves and acts, is placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Extremes. For we are capable but of ſuch things as lye in a middle State, and are of a moderate proportion. Theſe only are of a ſize with our Souls, They fit us, and therefore They Only pleaſe and are eaſy to us. thoſe of a lower Rank we look down upon with Indignation and Scorn; and thoſe of a higher Condition are too weighty and bulky for us; they create Wonder and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only; and therefore the wonder ought not to be great, if the Mind of Man recoil again, and ſhew a diſreliſh againſt all Religion; ſince in All there is ſo very little of ſuch Doctrine as is agreeable to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53648:360"/>the common Temper and Capacity of Mankind; but the principal Points of Faith and Worſhip are in one of the forementioned Extremes, and thoſe of Practice diſtant, either from common Uſe, or from general Inclination. Hence it comes to paſs, that the Men of ſtrong Parts have ſo often deſpiſed Religion, and expoſed it to the Deriſion of the World; and thoſe of Weak and Superſtitious Minds are confounded and ſcandalized at it. This was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Complaint in the firſt planting of the Chriſtian Faith;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note> 
                           <hi>We preach Jeſus Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And this indeed is the very Reaſon, why we find ſo much Prophaneneſs and Irreligion; ſo much Error and Hereſy, in the World. Some believe not at all, and others believe amiſs, becauſe they conſult their own Judgment only, and hearken to no other Guide, but the Dictates of human Reaſon. They bring matters of Religion to the ſame Trial with other common matters, and will needs undertake to examine, and meaſure, and judge of them, by the Standard of their own Capacity; They treat this Divine, like other Common and merely Human Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Profeſſions; expecting to maſter, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate to the bottom of it, by the ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts. But This is not the way of dealing with Divine Truths; A Man's Affections muſt be qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſpoſed for theſe Doctrines. They require Simplicity and Honeſty; meekneſs of Temper, an humble and obedient Mind. Theſe only can fit a Man for receiving Religion; For he that does ſo in good earneſt, muſt believe its Declarations, ſubmit to its Laws, and govern himſelf by them, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Reſignation of Soul. In ſhort, he muſt be content that his own Judgment ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Word of God; and to live and be led by univerſal Conſent and Authority; which ſeems to be the Subjection intended by the Apoſtle, when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53648:360"/>he ſpeaks of<note n="*" place="bottom">Captivantes intellectum ad obſequium Fidei.</note>

(For had the Caſe been thus, the moſt exalted Minds would have been in proportion eminent for Religion, and ſo many Men of Wit and Judgment in Other things, could never have been defective here), but theſe Notions muſt needs have been conveyed into Mens Minds, by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural

And thus you find, that All who believe, and profeſs Religion, ſay; for all of them do in effect aſſume to themſelves that Declaration of the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Gal. I. 1, 12.</note> 
                           <hi>Not of Men, neither by Man, nor of any other Creature, but of God.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> But, if we lay aſide all Flattery and Diſguiſe, and ſpeak freely to the Point,<note place="margin">But yet ſo they are.</note> there will be found very little, or nothing at the bottom of all theſe mighty Boaſtings. For, whatever Men may ſay or think to the contrary, it is manifeſt, that all ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are handed down and received by human Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. This Obſervation is true in its very utmoſt Senſe and Extent, of all Falſe and Counterfeit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions; for Theſe when ſearch'd to the bottom, are no better than Diabolical Deluſions, or Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: But True Religion, as it is derived down to us from a Higher Original, ſo it moves us by other Springs, and is received after a very different manner. And here, to get a right underſtanding of this matter, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Firſt Publication of the Truth, that Reception, which made it general, and gave it a Settlement in the World; and that Particular One, by which private Perſons embrace and come into it, when already eſtabliſhed. The Former of Theſe which firſt fix'd this Heavenly Plant, was altogether Miraculous and Divine; and agrees punctually with the Evangeliſt's account, The <hi>Lord working with</hi> the Apoſtles and Preachers, <hi>and confirming the Word with Signs following.</hi> But the Latter muſt be acknowledged in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Human, and private Mens Faith and Piety to be wrought by common and Ordinary Means. This ſeems to be ſufficiently plain, firſt, from the Manner of Religion's getting ground in the World, and that, whether we regard the firſt general planting of any
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53648:361"/>Perſuaſion, or the method of its gaining now upon private perſons. For, whence is the daily Increaſe of any Sect? Does not the Nation to which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, the Country where we dwell, nay the Town, or the Family in which we were born, commonly give us our Religion? We take that which is the growth of the Soil; and whatever we were born in the midſt of, and bred up to, that Profeſſion we ſtill keep. We are Circumciſed, or baptized, <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> before we can be ſenſible that we are Men; So that Religion is not the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People's Choice, but their Fate; not ſo much their own Act and Deed, as the Act of Others for and upon them.<note place="margin">See the Notes.</note> The Man is made a Member of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or Chriſtian Communion without his Knowledge, becauſe he is deſcended of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or Chriſtian Parents, and in a Country where this or that Perſuaſion obtains moſt. And would not this, do you think, have been his Caſe, if born in any other part of the World? Would not the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have been a <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Mahometan,</hi> if born where Heathen Idolatry, or <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> prevailed? But now as to the Obſervance, and living up to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Religion; Thoſe who are True and Pious Profeſſors, beſides the external Profeſſion of the Truth, they have the Advantage of the Gifts and Graces of God, the Aſſiſtance and Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, common to all, and from which, even the miſtaken are not utterly excluded. This indeed is a Privilege, which (bleſſed be God) is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being very uſual and frequent, and many great Pretenſions and pompous Boaſts are made of it. But yet I vehemently ſuſpect, notwithſtanding all the fair ſhew, and plauſible pretences Men make of this kind, This Grace and Spirit is not ſo largely and ſo commonly enjoyed, nor ſo ſtrong in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Effects, as Some would have us believe. For ſurely were This ſo powerful in us, and were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53648:362"/>Religion our own free Choice, and the Reſult of our own Judgment, the Life and Manners of Men could not be at ſo vaſt a diſtance and manifeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement from their Principles; nor could they, upon every ſlight and common occaſion, act ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the whole Tenor and Deſign of their Religion. And this Inconſiſtence of Faith and Manners, is alſo a Proof, that our Faith is not from God; for were this planted and faſten'd in our Minds by ſo powerful a hand as His, it could not be in the power of any Accident or Temptation to ſhake, or unſettle us; ſo firm and ſtrong a Band could not ſo eaſily be broken or burſt through. Were there the leaſt Touch, the ſmalleſt Ray of Divine Illumination, This Light would ſhine in every action of our lives, and dart it ſelf into every corner of our Souls; The Effects of it would appear in all our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and not only be ſenſible, but wonderful and amazing too, according to what Truth himſelf ſaid upon occaſion to his Diſciples;<note place="margin">Matth. xvii. 20.</note> 
                           <hi>If ye had faith but as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay to this mountain, Remove hence, and it ſhall remove; and nothing ſhall be unpoſſible to you.</hi> But alas! if we look abroad, and conſider the behaviour of the World; what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what correſpondence can we find, between the Belief of the Soul's Immortality and a future Judgment, and the Practices of Mankind? Would Men, Could Men indeed lead the lives they do, and at the ſame time be perſuaded in good earneſt, that a Recompence awaits them hereafter; ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy on the one hand, or ſo full of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſhame on the other? One ſingle thought, and the bare Idea of thoſe things, which Men profeſs ſo firmly to believe, would perfectly confound, and ſcare wicked Men out of their Wits. There have been inſtances of very ſtrange effects wrought upon Perſons, only by the apprehenſion of publick Juſtice; the Fear of dying by the hands of a Common Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53648:362"/>or ſome other Accident full of misfortune and reproach; and yet, What are all theſe Calamities, in compariſon of thoſe Horrors, which, Religion tells us, will be the Sinner's portion hereafter? And is it poſſible, that theſe things ſhould be entertained and believed indeed, and Men continue what they are? Can a Man ſeriouſly hope for a Bleſſed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, make This the Object of his Expectations and Deſires, and yet at the ſame time live in a ſlaviſh dread of Death, which he knows is the Neceſſary, the Only paſſage that can lead him to it? Can a Chriſtian fear and live under the apprehenſions of Eternal Death and Puniſhment, and yet indulge himſelf in thoſe very Vices, which that very Hell, he believes, is ordained to avenge? Theſe are moſt unaccountable Stories; and things as incompatible, as Fire and Water. Men tell the World that they believe theſe Doctrines, nay they perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they do really believe them; and then they endeavour to proſelyte others, and make Them believe ſo too; but alas! there is nothing in all this; nor do They, who talk and act thus inconſiſtently, know what it is to Believe. Such Profeſſors as theſe, are what an Ancient Writer called them, Liars and Cheats; or, as another expreſs'd himſelf very well upon the like occaſion, who reproached the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with being the gallanteſt Men in the World in ſome reſpects, but the pitifulleſt, and moſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible wretches in others. For, ſays he, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Articles of their Belief, you will think them more than Men; but if you examine their Lives and Converſations, you will find them worſe than Brutes, more filthy than the very Swine. Now certainly, if we were wrought upon by ſuch becoming Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God and Religion, as are the Effects of Grace, and an Engagement ſo forcible, as Thoſe of a Divine Power; nay, were we but perſuaded of theſe matters by a bare ſimple, and common Aſſent,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53648:363"/>ſuch an hiſtorical Faith, as we credit every Vulgar relation of matters of Fact with; did we but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Deference to what we call the Word of God, which we pay to the advice, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and common diſcourſe of our Friends and Acquaintance; the Doctrines of the Goſpel could not but be preferred by us, infinitely above any other advantages whatſoever, for the ſake of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Goodneſs and Excellence, ſo illuſtriouſly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in every part of them. But ſure the leaſt we can be imagined capable of in this caſe, would be to admit them into an equal ſhare of our Affection and Eſteem, with Honours, or Riches, or Friends, or any kind of Allurements this World can pretend to ſeduce us by. And yet, all this notwithſtanding, there are but very few, who are not more afraid to offend a Parent, or a Maſter, or a Friend, than they are of incurring the diſpleaſure of an Almighty God: And who would not rather chuſe to act in contradiction to an Article of Religion, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Heaven hereafter, than to break the meaſures of worldly Intereſt and Prudence, at the expence of what they ſtand poſſeſs'd of in preſent? This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Great Wickedneſs and Misfortune; but for Perſons who conſider things impartially, Chriſtianity will not ſuffer in Their Eſteem. The Honour and Excellence, the Purity and Sublime Powers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are no more Impaired or Polluted by it, than the Rays of the Sun contract Defilement from the Dunghils they ſhine upon. For Principles are not to be tried by their Profeſſors, but the Profeſſors by their Principles. But we can never exclaim ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently againſt thoſe vile Men, who profane the Truth, by their Vicious Lives; and againſt whom that very Truth it ſelf hath denounced ſo many Woes, and ſuch dreadful Vengeance.</p>

Till this be done, we ſhall but confound our ſelves with equivocal and ambiguous Terms; and prevaricate, both in Expreſſion and in Practice, as indeed the greateſt part of Mankind (it is to be feared) do upon this occaſion. Now there is nothing, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends more to a graceful Air, nor takes more true pains to appear like true Piety and Religion, than Superſtition does; and yet, at the ſame time, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more diſtant from, or a greater Enemy to it.

Now ſome of the moſt remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, wherein theſe two differ, are; That Religion ſincerely loves and honours God; ſettles the Mind in perfect eaſe and tranquillity, and dwells in a noble and generous, a free and gallant Spirit;

Now from the former Conſiderations it does, I hope, ſufficiently appear, that of the great Variety of Perſuaſions at preſent, or any poſſible to be Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, Thoſe ſeem to Challenge the Pre-eminence, and beſt deſerve the Character of Truth and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, which, without impoſing any very labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or much external Service upon the Body, make it their buſineſs to contract, and call the Soul home; that employ and exalt it by pure and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Contemplations, in admiring and adoring the Excellent Greatneſs, and Majeſty incomprehenſible of Him, who is the Firſt Cauſe of All Things; the Neceſſary, the Beſt, the Original Being; And All this, without any nice or preſumptuous declaration what this Being is, or undertaking poſitively to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and define any thing concerning that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

And thus much the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and other moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Sects of Philoſophers taught long ago. This is the Religion of Angels, and that beſt ſort of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers in Spirit and Truth, whom God ſeeks and loves. But among all thoſe leſs ſpiritualized Pagans, who could not ſatisfy themſelves with ſo refined a Principle, as Inward Belief, and the Exerciſe of the Soul only; but would needs gratify their Senſes and Imagination with a viſible Object of Worſhip, (which was an Error all the World almoſt was tinctured with.) The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> choſe a Calf; but None ſeem to have made ſo good a Choice, as thoſe who pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Sun for their God: This indeed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all other Creatures ſo vaſtly, with regard to its Magnitude, and Motion; its Beauty and Luſtre, its wonderful Uſe and Activity, and the many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Virtues, and Efficacies of its Influences; that it does certainly deſerve, nay, command the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the World; we cannot think too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, while we remember it is ſtill but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, look round this whole Fabrick, and (Man excepted) your Eye ſhall diſcover nothing ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nothing equal, nay, nothing near, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to it.</p>
                        <p>The Chriſtian Religion preſerves a due Temper between theſe Extremes, and by devoting both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul to God, and accommodating it ſelf to all Conditions and Capacities of Men, hath mixed the Inſenſible and Internal Worſhip, with that which is Senſible and External. Yet ſo, that the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Spiritual Perſons employ themſelves chiefly

Its buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to magnify God, and ſet Him as high; and to humble Man, and lay Him as low, as poſſibly we can. To ſubdue and beat him down, as a loſt worthleſs Wretch; and when this is once done, then to furniſh him with helps and means of raiſing himſelf up again; to make him duly ſenſible of his own Impotence and Miſery, how Little, how mere a Nothing he is; that ſo he may caſt away all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in himſelf, and place and ſeek his Hope, his Comfort, his Happineſs, his All, in God alone.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> That which Religion is chiefly concerned in, is the binding us faſt to the Author and Source of all Good; the grafting us afreſh, and conſolidating Man to his firſt Cauſe, like Branches or Suckers into their proper Root. For ſo long as Man continues firm and fixt in this Union, ſo long he preſerves the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature; but on the contrary, when once he falls off, and is ſeparated from it, all his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Powers are dried up and gone, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately withers and dies away.</p>

For theſe two comprehend under them all manner of Good whatſoever. The Profit or Gain, which is a real Amendment and bettering of our Perſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is an eſſential and internal Benefit; and This belongs to Man, who is of himſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, a Creature Impotent and Empty; Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Neceſſitous; and miſerable in all reſpects; The Glory is not ſo much an Advantage as an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Additional and External Grace; and This
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53648:367"/>belongs to God only; for he is the Fulneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Good; ſo abſolute and compleat, that nothing can be added to his Eſſential Happineſs; and therefore Benefit is a thing he cannot receive.

The firſt thing then, that we ought to be convinced and fully perſuaded of upon this occaſion, is His Exiſtence; then, That he created the World, and that all other Beings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are the Products of his Power, and Goodneſs, and Wiſdom: That by theſe ſame Attributes he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns this Univerſe of his own making; That his careful Providence watches over all things, and even the leaſt and moſt inconſiderable Events do not eſcape his obſervation; That whatſoever his Diſpenſations to Us are, they are all for our Good; and that all our Evil comes from our ſelves alone. For, if we ſhould account thoſe Accidents, which God appoints for us, to be Evils, this were to be guilty of great Prophanation, and to blaſpheme againſt his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this were to tear up the very Foundations of all Piety and Religion; becauſe Nature teaches us to Honour and love our Benefactors; but begets ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and averſion to them that deal unkindly by us, and do us miſchief. Our Duty therefore is to get a right Notion of God's dealings toward us; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that we will obey him at any rate; to receive all that comes from his hand, with Meekneſs and Contentation; to commit our ſelves to his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

When we have adorned and repreſented this moſt excellent Being to our ſelves, in all the moſt magnificent Ideas; when we have given him the moſt glorious Names, and ſung forth his Praiſes in the moſt excellent manner, that our Mind can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deviſe, or ſtrain it ſelf up to; we are ſtill with all Humility to acknowledge, that in all this we have not done, or offered to his Majeſty, any thing ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his own Excellency, or in it ſelf worthy his Acceptance; and to poſſeſs our ſelves with yet more awful and reſpectful Ideas of him, by the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe of our own Imperfections; That it is not in the power of Human Nature to conceive any thing better; though we plainly ſee, that our moſt exalted Thoughts ſerve not ſo much to ſhew us his Glory, as to reproach us with our own Weakneſs and Defects. For God is the laſt and higheſt Flight, which our Imagination is able to make, when it would ſoar up towards abſolute Perfection; and in aſpiring to this Idea, every Man lets looſe his Mind, and enlarges his Notions according to his own Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; or rather indeed, God is infinitely greater and higher than all the boldeſt and braveſt Flights of poor feeble Man; a Perfection more exquiſite, more bright, than the Dim Eye of Mortals can receive the Luſtre of, or the moſt tow'ring Imagination make any approach to.</p>

This is a ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male and Vulgar Piety, and vaſt numbers are taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it every where, at this very day; they lay out all their Diligence and Care upon thoſe little Exerciſes of outward Devotion; for Little ſure they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53648:372"/>are, as They uſe them, who never carry the Effects of them home to their Lives and Conſciences; but Pray, and Read, and frequent the Church, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and are not one whit the better Men for doing ſo. This gave occaſion to that Proverb, <hi>A Saint at Church, and a Devil at Home.</hi> They lend their hand, and their outſide to God, pay Him all the demonſtrations of Reverence and Reſpect; And a fair outſide it is; but all This, as our Lord told the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is but a whited Wall, and a whited Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; <hi>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> Nay, they do not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the Practice of other Duties, and take no pains to be all of a piece; but their very Holineſs it ſelf is from a wicked Deſign; they make this Piety a Cover for greater Impieties; alledge, and depend upon their Devotions, firſt to give them Credit in the World, and greater Opportunities to deceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask of ſo much Sanctity; and then for the extenuating or making a compenſation for their Vices, and ſinful Liberties.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Others there are, who run into a diſtant, and quite contrary Extreme: They lay ſo great Streſs upon Virtue and Moral Honeſty, as to value nothing elſe; and make Religion and Piety, ſtrictly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, no part of their Concern. This is a Fault ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in ſome of the Philoſophers; and may be obſerved very commonly in people of Atheiſtical Principles. And ſurely, it is the proper Fruit of ſuch a Corrupt Tree; for, that Men ſhould believe God and his Revelations; that they ſhould call Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, and yet be of opinion, that we are excuſed from all the Acknowledgments, and Marks of Homage due, and paid to God, in our Faith and Worſhip, and That Branch of our Duty, which is properly diſtinguiſhed by the Title of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, is very inconſiſtent, and unaccountable.</p>

                        <p> Theſe are the two Vicious Extremes; whether of the Two is the more or leſs ſo, I ſhall not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent take upon me to determine; nor will I diſpute, whether Religion, or Morality, will ſtand a Man in greater ſtead. Thus much only give me leave to add, by way of Compariſon, as to Three Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; which is, that the Former, as deſcribed in the laſt Paragraph, and practiſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> is without diſpute, by much the eaſier, the more pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous, and more incident to weak and vulgar Souls. The Latter muſt be allowed infinitely more difficult and laborious; it makes leſs Noiſe and Oſtentation in the World, and is more proper to Brave, Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and Generous Minds, for the former reaſons; as being more ſubſtantial, and of a larger compaſs, meeting with great oppoſition, and having leſs to feed Mens Vanity with.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> My buſineſs is next with a Second Sort of Men, <note place="margin">Againſt them that confound theſe two.</note> who confound and ſpoil all, for want of a juſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, but perplex theſe Two, and the Grace of God; and jumble all together. Theſe in truth are defective in all Three. When you come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter ſtrictly, they will be found to have neither true Religion, nor true Moral Honeſty, nor true Grace at the bottom; but by the Figure and all the outward appearances they make, they very much reſemble the Perſons mentioned before, who are ſo immoderately zealous for Religion, that they have little or no concern for any thing beſides; marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſatisfied with Themſelves, and mercileſs Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all the World beſides. And theſe are the Men, that make all manner of Probity and Good Actions to be a conſequent and attendant upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; wholly to depend upon, and entirely to be devoted to it; and ſo they acknowledge no ſuch thing as Principles of Natural Juſtice, or Probity of Mind, and otherwiſe than they are derived from, and moved by the Springs of Conſiderations purely
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53648:373"/>Religious. Now the Matter is far otherwiſe; for Religion is not only after it in Time, but more limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and particular in its Extent. This is a diſtinct Virtue, and not the Comprehenſion and Sum of all Virtues; and, as the Inſtances of <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> here prove, may ſubſiſt without Them, or that general good Diſpoſition of Mind, which we call Probity: And ſo again may They be independent of Religion, as the Examples of Philoſophers, and good Moral Heathens (who we cannot ſay had ever any Religion properly ſo called), ſhew on the other hand. This is alſo, according to the common Schemes of Theology, a Moral Virtue, a Branch of Juſtice, which we know is one of the Four Cardinal Virtues, and teaches us to give to All their Due; according to their Quality, and reſpective Claims. Now God being Supreme, the Maker and Maſter of the Univerſe, we are bound to pay him the moſt profound Honour, the moſt humble Obedience, the moſt punctual and diligent Service. This now is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Religion, and conſequently it is a diviſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the General Topick of Juſtice. Again, Theſe Perſons, as they miſtake the Nature, ſo do they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe invert the Order of things; for they make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion antecedent to Probity: But how can this be, ſince, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God;</hi> how, I ſay, can That which is the Effect of Revelation and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be the Cauſe of a Thing originally rooted in Nature, born with us, and inſeparable from us? For ſuch is that Law and Light of God, kindled in every Man's Breaſt, and interwoven with the Conſtitution of the whole Species. This therefore is plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the true Order of theſe matters; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of all method. They would have a Man Virtuous and entirely Good, merely for the Proſpect of Heaven to allure, or the Terrors of Hell to affright and awe him into his Duty. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53648:373"/>thoſe Expreſſions carry a very ill ſound, and ſpeak a mean and vulgar Virtue: 'If the Fear of the Divine Vengeance and Everlaſting Damnation did not reſtrain me, I would do thus or thus. O pitiful cowardly Wretch! what Senſe, what Notion haſt thou of thy Duty? what Inclinations doſt thou cheriſh all this while? what Motives doſt thou act upon? what Thanks doſt thou deſerve for all that is done upon ſuch conſtraint and againſt thy own Will? Thou art not wicked, becauſe thou dareſt not be ſo for fear of the Rod. Now I would have thee ſo perfect, as not to want the Courage but the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do amiſs; I would have thee ſo reſolutely good, as not to commit the leaſt Evil, though thou wer't ſure never to be chidden, never to be called to an account for it. Thou playeſt the part of a Good Man, that thou may'ſt be thanked and rewarded for thy pains; I would have thee be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, without any proſpect of hire or gain, nay though none but thy ſelf ſhould ever be conſcious of thy Virtue. I would have thee ſo, becauſe the Laws and Dictates of Nature and Reaſon direct and Command thee to be ſo. (For Nature and Reaſon in this caſe are but another word for God; and Theſe Principles, and That Light, and the Original Diſtinctions of Good and Evil are his Will and his Laws iſſued in a different manner). Becauſe the Order and Good Government of the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou art a part, require this at thy hands; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt not conſent to be otherwiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acting againſt thy ſelf, in contradiction to thy Being, to thy Intereſt, to the End of thy Creation; And when thou haſt thus ſatisfied thy duty and acted upon theſe motives, never be ſolicitous for the Event; but perſevere in Virtue, in deſpight of any Sufferings or Dangers that may threaten thee.</p>
                        <p>When I urge This as the beſt Principle of doing well, I do not wholly diſallow all others, nor utterly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53648:374"/>condemn that Probity required and cheriſhed by the external motives of Recompence and Puniſhment, as if Theſe were unlawful to be proceeded upon. Doubtleſs they have their Uſe and Efficacy; are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper for the reducing of Ill Men, who muſt be treated in a more ſlaviſh and mercenary way; and the Foundations thus laid at firſt come frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to noble Improvements. But ſtill I call this a poorer and meaner Principle, and would have my Wiſe Man aſpire to ſomething ſublimer, and more worthy his Character. For This requires a brighter, ſtronger, and more generous Probity, than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Mankind may be allowed to take up with. And even Divines have generally repreſented ſuch a Piety as Servile, Imperfect; accommodated to the weaker and more ignorant, and fitter for Babes and Beginners, than for Strong and Maſterly Chriſtians. This farther is very certain, that the Probity wholly depending upon a Spirit of Zeal and Religion; and having no regard to the Principles of Natural Light; beſides that it muſt needs be accidental and unequal in its Operations, and want that Evenneſs and Conſtancy which was there large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn to be one of its Properties; I add, that This is a very dangerous Principle, and does fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pruduce horrid and ſcandalous effects; for it makes all the Rules of Common Honeſty ſubſervient to Zeal for Religion; and opens a Door for all thoſe execrable Villanies, which the dear-bought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Ages hath too ſenſibly convinced us, are capable of being committed under the fair Shew and Colour of Piety. And Theſe are really ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deteſtable, that we have reaſon to queſtion, whether any other occaſion or pretence in the World have done more miſchief, than thoſe falſe but ſpecious profeſſions of Religion. The Cauſe and Honour of God is indeed the Greateſt, the Nobleſt, and moſt worthy our Zeal; and if it were not all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53648:374"/>this in its own nature, the abuſe of it could never be ſo fatal as it is. For Brave and Valuable things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſubjects for Hypocriſy; and what is little and deſpicable, as the right uſe of it does no great good, ſo the perverting it to wrong purpoſes can do no mighty harm. It is not therefore any Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Religion, but the confeſs'd Excellency of it above any other Subject whatſoever, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and falſe Pretences of it are ſo pernicious; Were it leſs good, the abuſe of it muſt have been leſs evil.</p>

He that profeſſes himſelf a good and an honeſt Man merely for the Check and Reſtraints which Religious Fears have

I will not call ſuch a Man wickeder; but ſure there is more danger in him, than if he had no Virtue nor Religion neither. Such People would tempt one to think that Religion whets their Paſſions, and enflames them with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Zeal,<note place="margin">John XVI. 2.</note> as it did the <hi>Jews</hi> of old; <hi>Whoſoever killeth you, ſhall think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> Not that I mean, by all This to caſt the leaſt Aſperſion upon Religion, as if It Taught, or warranted, or countenanced any kind of Evil, (as ſome who from hence take occaſion to argue and rail at Religion in general, would pretend; (For this is not to ſhew their reaſon, but to betray their extreme Folly, or their extreme Malice) The falſeſt and moſt abſurd of all Perſuaſions that ever were, will not own any ſuch Intention. But the bottom of all this Miſchief ſeems to lie here; That ſuch Men have no taſte or ſenſe, no Idea or diſtinct Notion of Sincerity and Honeſty, but merely as it retains to Religion, and is entirely in its ſervice and devotion; and withal they know no other Definition of a Good Man, but One who is extremely diligent and warm in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating and promoting the Religion himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes; From which two Imaginations joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they eaſily and naturally ſlide into a Third; and preſently perſuade themſelves, that any the blackeſt and moſt barbarous Enormities, Treachery and Treaſon, Seditions and Murthers, are not only lawful and allowable, when ſheltered under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Sanctity, and the protection of a Zeal for the advancement of one's Religion; but they are even Sanctified by this pretence; ſo far from deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Puniſhment or Reproach, that they commence Commendable and Meritorious; and think nothing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53648:375"/>leſs than a Canonization their due, if their own Party and Perſuaſion reap any advantage, or their Adverſaries ſuffer any damage or defeat from them. Thus the <hi>Jews,</hi> we read, were moſt unnatural and barbarous to their Parents; unjuſt to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; they neither Lent nor Gave to thoſe in want; and were ſo far from contributing towards ſupplying the Neceſſities of the Poor, that they refuſed to pay their own juſt debts; and all this becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Temple;<note place="margin">Matth.

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of a due Regulation of a Man's Pleaſures and Deſires.</head>
                        <p>ONE very conſiderable effect of Wiſdom, is the Teaching and Qualifying a Man, to be moderate in all his Pleaſures, and attain a perfect Maſtery over his Deſires. For, as for renouncing all our Pleaſures, and utterly extinguiſhing all Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I am ſo far from expecting any ſuch thing in that Pattern of Wiſdom I am now endeavouring to form; that I look upon This, not only as a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical and extravagant; but, which is a great deal worſe, I verily believe it to be a Vicious and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Notion. The firſt thing therefore requiſite to be done at preſent, is to confute that Opinion, which abſolutely condemns, and would fain exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all Pleaſures; and then, after the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing in general, to lay down ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, how Men ought to govern Themſelves in the Uſe and Enjoyment of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There is ſcarce any Opinion more ſpecious and plauſible, more admired by the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,<note place="margin">Of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World.</note> and more affected by thoſe who pretend to be, and would fain paſs for the beſt and moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of them, than the Contempt of the World. No Man ſets up for extraordinary Wiſdom and Sanctity, but One of his ſolemn and moſt pompous Profeſſions, is the Neglecting and abſolutely Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all ſorts of Pleaſure; a perfect Diſregard of the Body, an Abſtraction of the Mind, and retiring within himſelf; ſo as to cut off all correſpendence
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53648:377"/>with the World and the Body; raiſing and refining his Mind by the Contemplation of noble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Subjects; and thus contriving, that his life ſhall paſs away in a State of Inſenſibility; without ſo much as ever deſcending to taſte, or take notice of its Enjoyments. And indeed, the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Men's paſſing away their Time is in a peculiar manner applicable to theſe Perſons above any others: For they have a notion, that the beſt Uſe Life can poſſibly be put to, is to let it ſlide over without obſervation; to deceive the Time, and ſteal from the World, as if Living were a moſt miſerable Hardſhip, full of unavoidable Miſchiefs; and a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo burdenſome and tedious, that He only is happy, who can make his eſcape from it. Thus theſe great Sages dodge, and run away from the World; they do not only bring the common methods of Living into Suſpicion, and caſt an Odium upon the Recreations and Entertainments, and innocent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in common uſe; but they even proclaim War upon the Neceſſities of Nature; and profeſs an Averſion to thoſe very things, which God in his Wiſdom hath ſeaſoned with Pleaſure, on purpoſe to recommend the Uſe of them to us. They never come in the way of theſe, but with Reluctance, and are rather dragged, than move willingly; they keep their mind ſtill in exerciſe and employment upon ſomewhat elſe, and are abſent in thought all the while; In ſhort, If you will believe the mighty boaſts they make, and all the mortified account they give of themſelves, Their whole Life is a Toil and a Burthen; Death is the only Eaſe and Solace they propoſe to themſelves. And that unnatural Sentence is ever in their mouths,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vitam habere in Patientiâ, mortem in Deſiderio.</note> That they do indeed bear and can be content to Live, but if they might follow
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53648:377"/>their own Inclinations, the thing they wiſh, and would much rather chuſe, is to Die.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But it will be no hard matter to take off all the ſeeming Virtue of this Opinion, <note place="margin">This Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> and to blaſt the Glories and Commendations it pretends to. For when we come to a cloſe and impartial Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, The Unreaſonableneſs, the great Wickedneſs indeed, of ſuch a Contempt diſcovers it ſelf in ſeveral Inſtances. For, Firſt of all, if we conſult Nature, and attend to the Condition and Deſign of our Creation, Reaſon will teach us, that nothing is more Graceful, no Duty more Obligatory, than the conſidering and maintaining the Character aſſigned to us; that is in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Learning to live here, in all reſpects, as becomes Men. It is in truth a very difficult Study, but withal a moſt divine Accompliſhment, to know how to Enjoy and Uſe the Being God hath given us, as he intended we ſhould do: To obſerve the Common Model of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then the particular Circumſtances and Qualifications of our own State and Caſe: And ſo to adjuſt and proportion our behaviour to the firſt of theſe, as at the ſame time to be guilty of nothing foreign to our private Condition, or any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the part we are to play upon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theatre. We are to follow and to act what is given us, but not to invent and make a new part of our own head. But now theſe Extravagant Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, Theſe Studied and Artificial Eſſays and Overtures, Theſe ways of living beſide the common road, are all of them Sallies of Men's own Folly, and Paſſion, and impertinent Additions of ſuch, as, becauſe they do not underſtand their part, miſtake and overdo it. They are the Diſeaſes and Phrenſies of the Soul, that put Men quite beſide their Senſes. They Spiritualize themſelves, only to be more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fools; and while they affect the perfection of Angels, degenerate into the ſtupidity of Brutes. It
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53648:378"/>was wiſely ſaid by him in the Comedy, <hi>Homo ſum' humani à me nihil alienum puto;</hi> which with reſpect to our preſent Subject is, I my ſelf am a Man; and therefore muſt think nothing that is Human, unworthy my concern. For this is the very State of our Caſe. Man is a compounded Being; a Creature conſiſting of Soul and Body both; and it is by no means commendable to maim Nature and take the Building to Pieces, by cutting off this Fleſhly Tabernacle. God hath United, and as it were Married theſe Two together, by all the Ties of Nature, and the moſt tender intimate Affection; and how impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Undertaking is it for Us to create Jealouſies and Diſlikes, to drive things to Separation and Divorce, and thus to put aſunder thoſe whom God hath joined together? Quite contrary, we ſhould rather tye this Knot faſter, by all the good Offices and mutual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances they are capable of to one another. For indeed, they are well contrived for ſuch reciprocal Services. The Body of its ſelf is heavy and ſtupid, and therefore the Soul ſhould animate, and awaken, and render it Vigorous and Active. The Spirit of its ſelf is light and airy, and oftentimes very troubleſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brisk; and therefore the Body is of uſe to check and ſix it. In a word, The Mind ſhould govern, and cheriſh, and be helpful to the Body, (as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould aſſiſt and direct his Wife) and by no means hate, or caſt it off; or deſpiſe the Infirmities and Neceſſities of this weaker Veſſel. It is an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Niceneſs and Pride, to refuſe the partaking in its innocent Pleaſures; ſuch as Nature ordains, and the Laws of God and Man allow, for our Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Entertainment. For the thing required upon this Occaſion is not total Abſtinence, but prudent Moderation. Man is really bound to make this Life a conſiderable part of his Care; to taſte the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it; nay, to chew the Cud, and reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with Satisfaction; for all this is neceſſary
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53648:378"/>to give a right Reliſh and Value of them, and to make him duly thankful, and ſenſible of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Providence, which hath made ſo liberal a Proviſion for our Entertainment here below. Do not miſtake; There is no part of that which God hath in bounty beſtowed upon us, unworthy our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: Were it below Us to accept, it would have been much more below Him to give. We ſhall do well therefore to remember, not only that we may receive it, but that we are accountable for every the leaſt mite of it. And therefore the Uſe of Life is no jeſting matter; but a Commiſſion, and a Talent, which requires our moſt ſerious Care; that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in agreement to Nature, and governing our ſelves by ſuch Rules, as reſult from a due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, is an expreſs Duty, impoſed upon us in very good earneſt, and with an intent to be ſeverely reckoned for.</p>

Whereas in reality, Neceſſity and Pleaſure are the happieſt Marriage that ever God made in all the Courſe of Nature. It is a moſt convincing Demonſtration of his Infinite Wiſdom, that in thoſe Actions which are of greateſt Uſe and indiſpenſable Neceſſity to human Life, the matter ſhould be ſo order'd, that ſome agreeable Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould always attend them; and that our Senſes ſhould be feaſted, as often as our Wants are ſupplied. Thus are we doubly invited to our Refreſhments; firſt by Reaſon and Neceſſity, and then by Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and a certainty of being Gratified. Now your mortified and Philoſophical Contemners of the World take upon them to invert this Order, break the Rules of Nature, and utterly overthrow this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53648:379"/>beautiful Eſtabliſhment. Whereas in truth, it is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as unreaſonable and unjuſt to fall out with the World, and utterly renounce all Pleaſures, as it is to doat, and be fond of all, and abandon one's ſelf to all manner of Exceſs and Abuſe of them. In ſhort, We ſhould neither run after them, nor run away from them. But when they make their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and put themſelves in our way, we ſhould receive them kindly, love them moderately, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them ſoberly and diſcreetly; in ſuch manner as will be preſcribed hereafter, when our Method brings us to the Rules proper for this Occaſion.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> He who values himſelf upon this Abſtraction of the Soul, and keeping it in a Separate and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent State from the Body, let him give us a Trial of his Skill, when the Body is languiſhing under Sickneſs, or tortured with Pain; and ſhew that he can at ſuch a time preſerve it free, and above the reach of this Contagion. Then Experience will ſhew ſuch Attempts as much out of his Power, as Reaſon argues them to be againſt his Duty. For, if we will conſider this matter as in all Equity and Common Humanity it ſtands, it is certain the Soul ought not to abandon the Body, nor caſt off all Fellow-feeling of its Sufferings and Diſtreſſes. It is mere Apiſhneſs and Affectation for any Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. The Mind, if you pleaſe, ought to go thus far; It ſhould look both Pleaſure and Pain in the Face, without Commotion or Tranſport; with the ſame Compoſure of Countenance, and Evenneſs of Temper: Or rather let it meet the One with a Severe and Grave Mien, and the Other with an Air of Gaiety; But let the Circumſtances of the Man be what they will, the Mind is obliged upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to ſtand by the Body; to lend it Aſſiſtance, to eſpouſe it, Cauſe, and keep it in conſtant Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and good Order.</p>

                        <p> Temperance, which is the Rule and Standard of Pleaſure, conſiſts in a Mediocrity, and is no leſs diſtant from a Sullen Inſenſibility, which is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in point of Defect; than it is from Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Luxury, which is the other Extreme in Exceſs. For voluntary Rigor and Torment is unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and 'tis as ridiculous to hate cheap and eaſy Conveniences, as it is mad and fooliſh to purchaſe expenſive and uncommon Delicacles.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Contempt of the World ſounds big in the Mouth; they are very ſolemn and pompous Words, and ſuch as every Man proclaims his own Gallantry in, with great Triumph. But when we come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the true meaning of this Expreſſion, and what there is really in it; I cannot for my part think that the Perſons who uſe the Phraſe, know what they Intend by it; and much leſs does it appear, that any of them practice what it denotes, if it have any Senſe or Signification at all. For after all, What does this Deſpiſing of the World import? What is this World, which they repreſent as ſo juſt an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Contempt? Is it the Heavens, and the Earth, and in one word, what we call the Univerſe, or whole Frame of Created Beings? No; Theſe they allow are no ſuch deſpicable things. What are we to underſtand by it then? The Uſe and Profit, the Service and Convenience, which theſe Things are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of yielding us? What monſtrous Ingratitude would this be to the Great Author and Maker of all theſe things, who in Kindneſs fitted them to our uſe, and provided for our Neceſſities by them? What a Reproach and Accuſation upon Humane Nature in general, which leaves us liable to ſuch Neceſſities? For after all their bluſtering, I would fain know how they can diſpenſe with the want of Theſe things, or which way they can continue Men, and ſubſiſt without them? If then you ſhall evade this Difficulty too, and ſay that you underſtand the World neither
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53648:380"/>in the one, nor the other of theſe Senſes; but All that you make the Object of your Contempt, is the Abuſe of things Good and Neceſſary; that is, The Vanities and Follies, the Extravagances and Vicious Exceſſes, which you ſee daily practiſed, and which are the Failings common to all that appear to be fond of living like the reſt of the World; I muſt tell you, That, however commendable your Virtue, or the Deſign of it may be in it ſelf, yet you give it a wrong Name. For what can be more injurious than to call thoſe Things <hi>the World,</hi> which are no part of it, nor hath the World any thing to do with them? So far from it, that Theſe are all of them directly againſt the Order and good Government of the World; and in truth, have no Being, no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Nature, but are purely Additions of Mens making, born and brought up within their own Breaſts. Theſe are Artificial Debaucheries, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of wicked Induſtry and Skill, to corrupt and pervert Nature; and therefore the preſerving a Man's Self from theſe, in ſuch manner as the Study of Wiſdom, and the Rules, which you will meet with preſently, direct; This is not Deſpiſing the World, which is not one whit the leſs, but would be a great deal more perfect, if all theſe things were taken out of it; but it deſerves much rather to be called, Making a good Uſe of the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having one's ſelf prudently in it: And thus Divines make a very juſt Diſtinction, between Uſing the World, and Delighting in it. Theſe Philoſophical Gentlemen, I know very well, imagine Themſelves great Maſters, and that they have got quite above the World, and all its Temptations, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they practiſe ſome affected Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and have put themſelves in a way of living, quite beſide the common Road of the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But alas! This is all a Jeſt. The World hath nothing in it ſo Worldly, and ſo particular as theſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53648:380"/>very Men are; There is a great deal more trifling, and playing the Fool, by Thoſe that pretend to ſhun and live out of it, than by Them that are content to be thought in it; and if you would find Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Concern for the World in Perfection, you muſt ſeek it in thoſe places, where you hear moſt of running away from it, and ſcorning all its Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Upon the whole matter, This abandoning all Pleaſures, and ſtifling all our Deſires, is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme as culpable, as abandoning our ſelves to them. What I ſay here, is intended as a juſt Reproof of Thoſe Men and their Hypocriſy, whoſe pretended Mortifications, and particular way of making a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World, ſerves only to ſwell them more with Pride, and fill them with impudent and cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malice againſt all who are not of Their way: But I would not be thought to caſt the leaſt Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon any Religious Self-denial, or any ſuch Retirements and Auſterities as are practiſed for the Advantage of Piety and Heavenly Contemplation. But ſtill I ſay, To condemn and diſallow ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and ſuch Gratifications without Reſerve, is the Effect of a Sick Imagination; a fantaſtical, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and unnatural Opinion.

All that we have to do in the Caſe, is to learn how to enjoy theſe things, and to uſe them ſafely; to harken to the Voice of Wiſdom, and conform our ſelves to thoſe Rules of Behaviour, which ſhe will not fail to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with upon this Occaſion.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now the Direction, neceſſary for this purpoſe may very well be reduced to Four Particulars. Firſt, <note place="margin">The ſecond part, which concerns the regulating our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and deſires.</note> That our Deſires be Little. Secondly, That they be Natural. Thirdly, That they be Moderate. And Laſtly, That they be bounded within a ſhort compaſs, and with regard to one's own ſelf. And theſe are ſuch
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53648:381"/>Qualifications, as, if theſe mighty mortified Perſons, and magnanimous Contemners of the World would practiſe in good earneſt, I ſhould allow them to be Excellent Men indeed. Theſe Four generally go together. And, when thus in Conjunction, they make up one Perfect and Entire Rule. One might indeed contract them into leſs compaſs; And he that is diſpoſed to ſave his Memory, may comprehend all the Four Qualities in this ſingle Word, <hi>Natural.</hi> For in truth, Nature, if we would faithfully purſue her Dictates, is not only the Fundamental, but of her ſelf alone a Sufficient Direction to us, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this whole matter. But however, to explain the Thing more fully, and for the making our Notions more clear and eaſy, we will allow each of theſe Particulars a diſtinct Conſideration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Firſt Branch then of this Rule concerns the Quantity of the Object, and commands us to deſire but Little. The reſtraining our Deſires, and cutting them ſhort, ſo that they ſhall extend to very few, if any Things at all, is of infinite Uſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: It is the ſtraighteſt Road to Happineſs; a certain Defence againſt the Aſſaults of Fortune; it ſecures all the Avenues by which ſhe can attack us, and leaves her nothing to faſten upon; It is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſe we can take to live Contentedly, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and in one word, Wiſely. He that can bring himſelf to deſire nothing, the matter is not great if he have nothing; for even upon theſe Terms he is as Rich, and as Great, as he that poſſeſſes all things; They come both to one at laſt; for in ſumming up a Man's Wants,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nihil intereſt, an habeas, an non concupiſcas.</note> 
                           <hi>it makes no difference in the account, whether you actually have a thing, or whether you have no deſire of it.</hi> For which reaſon it was well enough obſerved, that Wealth and Contentment were not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53648:381"/>to be attained by Variety and Abundance, but by Scarcity and Nothing; that is, by Scarcity of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; for He that is Poor in Deſires is Rich in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Summae opes inopia Cupiditatum.</note> 
                           <hi>The Want of Deſires is the true, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wealth.</hi> In a word, The Man who deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hath made great Advances toward a State of Abſolute Perfection, and is in ſome degree like God himſelf. He approaches very near to the Condition of the Saints and Bleſſed Spirits in Heaven, whoſe Happineſs does not conſiſt in having and enjoying all that We value here below, but in not wanting, not deſiring, and being above it all.<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui Deſiderium ſuum clauſit, cum Jove de faelicitate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendit.</note> 
                           <hi>He that hath maſtered, and confined his Deſires, may vye Happineſs with</hi> Jove <hi>himſelf;</hi> ſays a Heathen Author. But on the other hand; if we let the Reins looſe, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Appetite to fly out at pleaſure; if nothing but Abundance will ſatisfy, and we grow Nice and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in the Propoſals we make to our ſelves, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Miſery and Torment muſt be our Portion. Things in their own Nature ſuperfluous will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary and indiſpenſable; our Mind loſes its Native Freedom, and is enſlav'd to the Body; and all we live for from thenceforward, is only Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pleaſure. If we do not moderate our Pleaſures and Deſires, and meaſure all we have, and all we ſeek, by the Standard of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Opinion will carry us away, and run us upon Pits and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, without bounds, or bottom. For when we once have begun to indulge our Extravagances, there is no knowing where the Luxury will end. At this rate, for inſtance, we may cover our Shoes, firſt with Velvet, then with Gold, after that with Embroidery, and at laſt come to ſet them with Pearls and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53648:382"/>And thus when we lay the Foundations, and carry up the Walls of our Houſes, we may riſe from Stone to Marble, and then to <hi>Jaſpar</hi> and <hi>Porphyry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This method of enriching one's ſelf hath likewiſe theſe farther Advantages, that it expoſes a Man to no Fraud or Injuſtice, but is agreeable to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rules of Equity; and it is alſo entirely in every one's own power and diſpoſal. There is no need of going abroad to ſeek for Contentment; it dwells at home; we need but ask our ſelves, and we may have it: Stop but the Current of our own Deſires, and the thing is done. How unreaſonable is all the Formality of Prayers, and Vows, and Wiſhes; all the Complaints we make of Vexations and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments; all the Blame we lay upon God and Nature, and the World, how wicked and unjuſt are they; when the Reſult of all is in truth no more than This, That we want ſomething to be given us, which none can give, none can procure, but our ſelves; and which we are ſo abundantly provided with Means and Opportunities of obtaining, that we cannot poſſibly fail of it, unleſs we will be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves?

Take this then for the firſt Rule neceſſary for the Regulating Mens Pleaſures and Deſires, That the Quantity be rightly adjuſted. For this <hi>Little,</hi> or to expreſs the thing in terms every whit as true, though more acceptable, A moderate Proportion, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Mind, is the thing that brings Wiſdom and Satisfaction. This is what will content a Wiſe Man, and keep him always in a State of Eaſe and Tranquillity. Upon the full Conviction of this Truth it is, that I have choſen for my <hi>Motto</hi> thoſe two ſignificant words; <hi>Paix &amp; Peu. Quiet and a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> A Fool thinks nothing enough; he is ſickle and irreſolute; knows not what he would have; nor when to have done; and conſequently can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be contented, becauſe he never knows what would ſatisfy him. Such a Man is well enough repreſented by the Story <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells of the Moon; which came to her Mother, and begged ſhe would give her ſome New Cloaths that would ſit her; but received this Anſwer, That ſuch a Garment was impoſſible to be made, for ſhe was ſometimes very Big, and at other times very Little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Increaſing or Decreaſing; and how then could ſhe expect to be ſitted with a Garment, which muſt always be the ſame, when her own Body was ſo changeable, that its Bulk was never two days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The next Point is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That our Deſires and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures be <hi>Natural;</hi> and this in truth carries great Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Reſemblance to the former. For we cannot but obſerve, that there are Two ſorts of Pleaſures; Some of which are <hi>Natural,</hi> and Theſe are Juſt and Lawful; They have a foundation in our very Temper and Frame, and are imparted, not to Men only, but are exactly the ſame in Brutes Theſe Appetites and the Gratifications of them are ſhort, and bounded
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53648:383"/>in a narrow compaſs; it is an eaſy matter to ſee to the End of them. Now with regard to ſuch, no Man is, or can be poor; becauſe all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and all Places furniſh enough to ſatisfy theſe Inclinations. For Nature is Regular and Abſtemious, a very little contents her; and not only ſo, but ſhe is very well provided too, and puts into every Man's hand as much as will ſuffice to ſupport him. Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Parabile eſt quod Natura deſiderat &amp; expoſitum; Ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt quod ſat eſt.</note> 
                           <hi>That the Suſtenance Nature requires, is always ready, and any-where to be had; and it is very eaſy to come at enough for the ſupply of our Neceſſities;</hi> For that which Nature requires for the preſervation of its Being is in reality as much as we need; and ſure we ought to acknowledge it a particular Happineſs, and a ſpecial Favour, that Thoſe things which we ſtand in need of for the ſupport of Life; as they muſt be had or we periſh, ſo they are eaſy to be had, and no body need periſh for want of them; and that the matter is ſo contrived, that whatever is hard to be obtained, we can be without it, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no great Prejudice. If we lay aſide Fancy and Paſſion, and follow Nature and Neceſſity, we are always rich, and always ſafe; for theſe will direct us to ſuch purſuits, as all the malice of Fortune cannot defeat. To this ſort of Deſires, we may add too thoſe others, which regard the Cuſtoms of the Age and Place we live in, and the Circumſtances and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Perſons and Fortunes. For I can eaſily allow, that They ſhould be comprehended under this Head too, though it muſt be confeſs'd, that they do not come up to the ſame degree of Neceſſity with the former. If we will ſpeak ſtrictly and conſider things according to their utmoſt rigour, Theſe are neither Natural, nor Neceſſary; but if they be not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53648:383"/>abſolutely ſo, yet they follow cloſe in order, and are next to Thoſe that are. They do indeed exceed the bounds of Nature, which hath done her part, when ſhe maintains us in Any Condition; but yet we are not tied to all that Exactneſs, but are permitted to enlarge our Deſires farther; and may, without any breach of Virtue, deſire a Competency, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Rank Providence hath placed us in. We may, I ſay, deſire and endeavour this fairly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably; but yet with this Reſerve, that it is againſt Juſtice and Reaſon both, to murmur and be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if we be diſappointed in our Hopes, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Poſſeſſion of it. For Theſe are Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Advantages, and the Effect of Bounty; all that Nature hath bound her ſelf to, is the Subſiſtence of our Perſons, and we have no Right to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt not omit to obſerve, that there are (as I hinted before) another ſort of Pleaſures and Deſires which we may truly call Unnatural, becauſe they are quite beſide and beyond the Bounds already mentioned. With Theſe Nature hath nothing at all to do; ſhe knows them not; They are of a Baſtard Race; Fancy and Opinion give them birth; Art and Induſtry Cheriſh and Improve them; They are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and ſtudied Follies; and muſt not be allowed ſo mild a Term, as Appetites, but are moſt truly, and in the worſt ſenſe of the word, Paſſions. I know not well indeed, what Title to diſtinguiſh them by; they are ſo fantaſtical, that it is not eaſy to find a Name, for them; but call them if you will, Luſtings, Longings, Any thing that expreſſes the Whimſy and Impatience of a wild and wanton Mind. Theſe we have therefore ſpoken to already, when in the Firſt Book we treated of the Paſſions at large; all that is neceſſary to be added here concerning them is only, That the Greateſt part of what Men call Deſires, are ſuch as Theſe; and that They are the proper ſource
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53648:384"/>of that Miſery and Fretfulneſs we ſee Mankind ſo generally diſquieted by; and That a Wiſe man will think himſelf concerned to diſtinguiſh his Virtue in no one Inſtance more, than in keeping himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and entirely clear from any Vanities of this kind.</p>

                              <hi>See</hi> Book III. Ch. 40.</note> The Third Qualification requiſite upon theſe Occaſions, is, That all our Pleaſures and Deſires be Moderate; by which I mean, that they ſhould be guilty of no Exceſs in any reſpect whatſoever. Now This is a Rule of a very large Extent, and capable of being parcelled out into a great many ſubdiviſions, but I think All of them may be reduced to theſe Two; That neither, <hi>firſt</hi> our Neighbour, nor <hi>ſecondly</hi> our Selves ſuffer by them. When I mention other People's Sufferings, I deſign by it, that we ſhould indulge our Selves in nothing that may any way give any perſon diſquiet, by ſcandalizing him, or miniſtring juſt cauſe of Reſentment; nothing that may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his loſs or prejudice, by hurting his Perſon, Eſtate or Reputation: By Our Own ſuffering I mean, that we ſhould have all due regard to our Health, our Leiſure, our Buſineſs, and particularly the Offices of our Calling and Capacity, our Honour, and above all, our Duty. And He that is content with being ſubject to theſe Reſtraints, and takes care not to break in upon any of the forementioned Boundaries, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be ſuch a one, as exerciſes what I call Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Pleaſures and Deſires.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> There remains yet a Fourth Direction, which is, a Short Compaſs, and a conſtant Regard to ones ſelf. For, beſides that our Deſires muſt not be let fly at large, nor our Pleaſures run wild without any Check or Controul; the very Courſe and Figures they move in, muſt be managed and rightly ordered. It is not enough, that a ſtop be put to their Career; but, if the Reader will permit that Alluſion, they muſt not move in a Right Line, but in a Circle, of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53648:384"/>which the Perſon himſelf is the Center. My meaning is, They muſt not run out into Lengths a great diſtance from us, as Right Lines do; but they muſt have a conſtant reſpect to, keep near, and quickly return again, to the Point from whence they ſet out at firſt: For This is to terminate in our ſelves; and to make our own Neceſſities and Enjoyments the Subject and the Meaſure of them. And what miſerable work do They make, who do not govern themſelves by this Reflection? How wretched, for want of keeping cloſe, and moving round their proper Center, are the Slaves to Avarice, and Ambition; and infinite others, who are ſollicitous for Poſterity, and contriving to keep up the Family in long diſtant Succeſſions, or upon any pretence, as vain as theſe, run beyond themſelves, and are perplexed for things that no way concern them? Such Actions are properly Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical and Irregular, Fanciful and Vain; and yet ſo very frequent withal, that, if all theſe Unreaſonable Projects were reduced, or quite taken away out of our lives, it is incredible, how great a part of Men's Cares and Anxieties would be cut off with them.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> EVERY Man in this World hath two ſorts of Fortune to grapple with; a Good, and an Ill Fortune; or Proſperity and Adverſity, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it. Theſe are the Rencounters, in which a Man ought to ſtand upon his Guard; the Trying Seaſons, when we are moſt obliged to have our Wits about us. The two Schools, by whoſe Diſcipline we are trained up in Wiſdom; the Eſſays, or Touchſtones, which bring Men's Minds to the Teſt; and diſcover whether they be Standard or not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Common and Ignorant part of the World have no notion of Trial, except in One of Theſe only; They can by no means imagine, how Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and kind Fortune ſhould poſſibly make a Man work, or involve him in any Difficulty or Trouble; they hear no Threatning, and ſo they fear no Danger. They are ſo tranſported, ſo giddy with their Joy upon theſe occaſions, that they loſe all Senſe; know not where they are, nor what they do; and ſo Inſolent, that there is no enduring them. And in Affliction again, they are ſo miſerably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ſo perfectly ſtunned and confounded, that they have no manner of ſenſe left; but are affected with this Sickneſs and Feebleneſs of the Mind, as we generally ſee men with That of the Body, who are always uneaſy and in pain, can bear neither Heat nor Cold, but are reſtleſs and diſſatisfied in either Extreme.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But Wiſe Men have quite different notions of the matter; <note place="margin">Which the harder.</note> They obſerve and acknowledge a Difficulty in Both; and think it an inſtance of equal weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on Which ſide ſoever the miſcarriage happens. And indeed it is the ſame Vicious defect, and as egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a Folly, for a Man not to be able to govern himſelf in Proſperity, as not to ſupport himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Adverſity. But though all Men of Judgment allow a Difficulty on Either ſide, yet on which hand the difficulty is Greater, they are not ſo perfectly agreed. Some are of Opinion, that Adverſity is the harder Task of the Two; by reaſon of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Severity, and that ſenſible ſharpneſs we feel under the ſmart of it. So ſays one Philoſopher,<note n="*" place="bottom">Difficilius eſt Triſtitiam ſuſtinere, quam à delectabilibus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinere.</note> 
                           <hi>It is harder to endure, and bear up under Grief, than to deny one's ſelf, and be moderate in Joy;</hi> and another,<note n="†" place="bottom">Majus eſt Difficilia perſtringere, quam Laeta moderati.</note> 
                           <hi>It is a nobler Victory to get well over Hardſhips, than to temper Pleaſures.</hi> Others again rather incline to Proſperity, and think This the nicer and more dangerous State of the Two. They obſerve very truly, that Good Fortune charms and gets within us by her Smiles and kind Careſſes; That there is Treachery at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all this Fondneſs; that it unbends and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Mind, enervates all its Powers, ſteals away its generous Qualities, and, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> dealt by <hi>Sampſon,</hi> betrays the ſtrength and vigour of the Soul, and reduces the beſt and braveſt Heroes to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of common Men. And of This we have frequent Inſtances; Perſons who have been firm and inflexible, ſtood their ground, and born the ſhock of Adverſity with all the Reſolution and Gallantry in the World; and yet even Theſe Invincible Sufferers, whom Affliction could not break, Proſperity hath
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53648:386"/>quickly vanquiſhed and melted down. Courtſhip and Flattery have effected what Threats and Blows never could; and Verified that Saying, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is no ſuch eaſy matter, but This muſt be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured too; (how odd ſoever that expreſſion may ſound) and<note n="†" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As Full Ears load and lay the Corn, ſo does too much good Fortune bend and break the Mind. It deſerves to be conſidered too, as another Diſadvantage, that Affliction moves Pity, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles our very Enemies; but Proſperity provokes Envy, and loſes us our very Friends. Again, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is a deſolate and abandoned State; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People are like thoſe infamous Animals, that live only upon Plenty and Rapine; and as Rats and Mice forſake a tottering Houſe, ſo do Theſe the Falling Man. Now This hath ſometimes that good effect, that when One perceives himſelf thus reduced and deſtitute, and that his own Endeavours are all he hath to truſt to; his Courage is awakened, he rouzes and ſhakes himſelf, collects and exerts all his Powers, and with wonderful Bravery and Succeſs forces his way through. In Proſperity, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Every body is making their Court by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, and Commendations, proffers of Service, and officious Aſſiſtances; and This is a Temptation to Negligence and Security, we truſt to Others, and neglect our Selves; apprehend no difficulty becauſe we feel none, and promiſe abſolute ſafety, while we ſee not our danger; Till at laſt our falſe Confidences deceive us, and we are ſenſible of our Error, when it is too late to retrieve it. Thus much, and a great deal more might be urged on both ſides of the Queſtion, which I ſhall not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on either ſide; For it may be, that it is not capable of any general and poſitive Deciſion, one
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53648:386"/>way or other. And the moſt probable Reſolution we can come to in the caſe, is in my poor Judgment This; That Both the forementioned Opinions are true as it may happen; and that Proſperity is more difficult to ſome, and Adverſity to others, according to the different Diſpoſitions and Complexions of the Perſons concerned in making the Experiment. But if we look at the Thing it ſelf, and the Uſefulneſs of it in general, the Advantage ſeems to lie on the ſide of Adverſity: For this is the ſeed and occaſion of great Virtues, the Field in which the Braveſt Heroes have ſignalized themſelves. For Wounds and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips provoke our Courage, and when our Fortunes are at the loweſt, our Wits and Minds are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the beſt.</p>

Thus Events are his Materials, and whatever comes to hand, he will not fail to convert into an occaſion of doing good; and how different ſoever the Aſpects of Fortune may be to Him, yet his own face always keeps the ſame Air.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ad utroſque caſus Sapiens aptus eſt; Bonorum Rector, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum Victor.

Calamities find him gallant, reſolute, and inflexible; Luxury and Eaſe he is not only no Friend, but an Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Enemy to. And, in ſhort, this is his greateſt Excellence and the Juſt Commendation and Character of a Good Man, in all the variety of human Chances, to raiſe the Soul, and get above the Promiſes and Threats of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> Thus Wiſdom equips us for the Fight; She puts proper Weapons into our Hands, teaches us to handle the Arms ſhe gives, and when we are well diſciplin'd, leaves us to engage, as the Laws of Combat, and the preſent Exigence of Affairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. When we are to encounter with Adverſity, She provides us a Spur to quicken us, raiſes and whets our Courage, calls up our Reſolution, and hardens our mind againſt it; and thus She inſpires us with the Virtue of Fortitude; When Proſperity engages us, She puts a Bridle into our Hand to curb and contain us, that our Flights may not be too bold, but all regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Prudence and Modeſty; and thus She qualifies us with the Virtue of Temperance.

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> All the general Inſtruction, <note place="margin">Of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> which I think neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this place, with regard to Proſperity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of theſe Three Conſiderations. Firſt, That it is a great Miſtake, nay, a great Injuſtice, which thoſe Men are guilty of, who eſteem Honours, and Riches, and other Gifts and Advantages of Fortune, Good things; and reckon them among the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Happineſſes of Human Life. For with what pretence can they be called Good? They can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impart nor improve Goodneſs; they reclaim no Man who lives amiſs; nor can they reform one vicious Habit; nor are they peculiar to, or any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character of Good Men, but diſtributed promiſcuouſly, and, at leaſt in equal Proportions, to the Wickedeſt and worſt part of Mankind. And He, that calls them Good in the notion of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53648:388"/>and places his Hopes and his Felicity in them, hath committed his Treaſure to a Rotten Cable, and anchored his Veſſel upon a Quickſand. For what is there in the whole World, ſo ſloating and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the Poſſeſſion of ſuch ſlippery Advantages? They go and come at randome, no body knows how nor why; flow in upon us, and Ebb off again like a ſudden Tide of Water: Like That, they come on with noiſe and obſervation, are violent and fierce in their motions, troubled and foul in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And like That too, they preſently diſappear, leave us drawn dry of all our overflowing Comforts and Joys, and nothing but Mud, and Stench, and Filth, left behind at low Water.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Second part of this Advice, is, To entreat Men, that they would remember, what the Nature of Proſperity is; That nothing better reſembles it, than a Poyſon given in Honey; which, though it be ſweet and pleaſing upon the Palat, yet is fatal in the operation, and Certain Death at the Stomach; and therefore that Men ought to be conſtantly upon their Guard againſt its treacherous Flatteries. When For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſmiles upon us, and every thing falls out to our hearts deſire; then is the ſeaſon eſpecially for Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Fear; then we ſhould be more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſevere in the Government of our Paſſions, and draw the Reins tight, becauſe we are apter to grow skittiſh, and fly out at ſuch times. Then we ſhould be careful, that all our Behaviour be ſerious and compoſed, and above all things avoid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Inſolence; which are exceeding apt to grow upon us in the midſt of Gaieties and fair Weather. Alas! Proſperity is a very ſlippery Ground, and all a Man's caution is little enough, to ſtand faſt, and tread ſure in it. There is not any Circumſtance in the World, in which Men are more diſpoſed to forget God; it is the very critical Seaſon that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes Religion leaſt, and yet needs it moſt. One
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53648:388"/>tolerable account whereof, among others, may be This; That you very ſeldom meet with any fortunate Man, who is content to aſcribe his Succeſſes to the Bleſſing and Providence of God; but all Men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think they owe their Advancement to their own Merit, and call themſelves the Makers of their own Fortunes. Since then this is ſo very hazardous a State, a Man ought leaſt to depend upon himſelf in it, and the greater his Proſperity is, the leſs ſtill is he fit to be truſted. This is the proper Time of calling in Succours, of making uſe of our Friends for their Counſel and Aſſiſtance, of giving what they adviſe more than ordinary weight and Authority; and in a manner putting our ſelves into their Guardianſhip and Protection. To be ſhort; a Man upon Theſe occaſions ſhould act, as he would, if he were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in very ſlippery Ways, or upon ſome dangerous Precipice; he ſhould take every ſlep with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fear, and beg ſome faithful Guide to lend him his hand. For want of theſe Precautions it is, that ſharper Remedies become ſometimes neceſſary; and even Affliction it ſelf often proves a ſeaſonable and very ſucceſsful Application, to ſettle Men's Heads that were grown giddy; and bring them back to the knowledge of themſelves again.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Third Admonition I would give at preſent, is, That Men upon theſe occaſions would put a Bar to their Deſires, and not ſuffer them to grow extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, and out of all meaſure. Proſperity natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſwells the Heart, dilates the Spirits, puſhes us on to new Undertakings, ſills us with great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Succeſs, and will not ſuffer us to ſee the Difficulties ſufficient to defeat and diſcourage our Attempt; It makes us more impatiently eager of more and greater Attainments, (ſomewhat like a very vulgar Proverb, which ſays, <hi>The Eating a good Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt gets a Man a keener Stomach to his Dinner);</hi> In one word, it exalts, and carries us quite beyond our ſelves:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53648:389"/>And then it is, that by graſping at More, we loſe All; plunge into ruin, and make our ſelves a Jeſt and publick Scorn; Like the Monkey that skips from Bough to Bough, till he get to the Top of the Tree, and then turns up his Tail to the Company. It is really a very deplorable thing, to rellect how many brave Men have been loſt, and come to a miſerable End, merely for want of Prudence to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and check thoſe aſpiring Thoughts, which Proſperity and Greatneſs puſh'd them forward with. The moſt adviſble courſe therefore is to put a ſtop to theſe towring Imaginations; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For it is One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable point of Wiſdom, to ſet up our Staff when we are well; to ſecure our Eaſe and Contentment, which can never dwell in that Breaſt, which is never at reſt; but eternally urging its Fortunes on farther, and fixes upon no Period of its Labours; no End where to ſit down, and make a final Settlement.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The general Advice and proper Reflections againſt Adverſity, <note place="margin">Of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. It is not Evil.</note> conſidered in the groſs, are ſuch as follow. Firſt of all, A Man ſhould take great care that he be not impoſed upon with that general Opinion (among the common ſort of People eſpecially) which repreſents Affliction, as a thing Evil in its own Nature. This is, like moſt of the vulgar No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, extremely falſe and unjuſt, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that can be to ſound Reaſon. They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſtrange dread and abhorrence of all manner of Adverſity; and therefore, to propagate, as well as juſtify this Averſion, they render it as odious as is poſſible, by running it down, and loading it with hard Names; they call Afflictions, Calamities, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, Dreadful Evils; Sore and Intolerable Evils; whereas in truth, none of theſe Outward Things are
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53648:389"/>either Good or Evil in their own Nature; but of a middle kind, and in a ſtate of perfect Indifferency. Adverſity never made any one Man wicked, ſince the beginning of the World; but hath proved a very ſucceſsful Inſtrument for reducing and reforming Perſons very far engaged in Wickedneſs before; and hath in many other reſpects been the happy occaſion of very great Advantages, to the Perſons labouring under it: And it is too manifeſt to need a Proof, that it is by no means the Mark of Vengeance ſet upon Wicked Men; for the Good have large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions alſo; and no Man can diſtinguiſh Virtue and Vice by Events; but all things in this preſent Condition of Mortality are order'd by a promiſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence, and happen to all Men alike.</p>

In the Ignorant and Fooliſh, the Reprobate and Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, their only Operation is, the Driving them to Deſpair; perplexing them with Trouble, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them with Rage: The Extremity of their Sufferings does indeed ſometimes bend them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; forces them to ſtrike Sail, and humble themſelves; extorts ſome Prayers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the God that ſmites them; but if they look up and cry to Heaven, this is all; the Effects of it are of no continuance, nor does all their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction make them one whit the better Men. To Unthinking and Careleſs Tranſgreſſors they are ſo many lively and ſenſible Inſtructions, which by the ſharpneſs of the Pain drive them to Recollection, and a Second Thought; and in a manner ſorce from them Acknowledgments of God and their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

The firſt Inventer and Original of them is Sin; this gave them a Being, and without it they had never exiſted, nor had any place in Nature at all. The Second is the Anger and Juſtice of God, who being provoked by Sin, iſſues out his Commiſſions, and employs theſe, as the Miniſters and Inſtruments of Vengeance, to execute Wrath upon them that do evil. The Third is, the Polity of the World, as it ſtands at preſent; its Order diſturbed, its Adminiſtration corrupted, and its whole Frame vitiated and Changed by Sin. The State of Nature, by theſe lamentable Alterations, is like That of a Kingdom under a general Mutiny or Civil Inſurrection; where Every thing is out of its proper place, and no part does its Duty; and what can poſſibly be the Conſequence of This, but Calamity and Confuſion? The Miſeries of ſuch a Body Politick, are like the Pains, and Aches, which afflict the Natural Body; when its Limbs are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed; the Bones bruiſed or diſlocated; and all the Ligaments, that ſhould knit and keep theſe in their Duty and proper Station, looſed or cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Theſe three Cauſes therefore producing ſuch diſmal Effects, our Reſentments toward Them ſhould be proportion'd to the Injuries they do Us. The Firſt is the deteſtable Root of all our Unhappineſs,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53648:391"/>and This we ſhould hate and avoid. The Second is the terrible Judgment of a juſt and provoked Deity, and This we ought to live in an awful Dread of. The Third betrays us into Miſchief, and This we ought to beware of as an Impoſtor, and manage our ſelves as would become conſiderate Men, to That which they know will decoy them into Ruin. But with regard to the Afflictions ariſing from all Three, the beſt courſe of ſecuring our ſelves, will be to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and kill them, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Goliah,</hi> with his Own Sword; that is, as I ſaid before, to convert this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity into Virtue, to make Advantage of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and retort the very Sufferings they bring upon us, back again upon heir own heads. For Affliction, which is in truth the genuin Fruit of Sin, if well, and wiſely entertained, will choak and kill the bitter Root that bears it. It deals with its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Parent, as the Young Viper is ſaid to do with the Old One, that hatches it; and is like Oyl of Scorpions, the Sovereign Remedy for All that are ſtung by them: Thus Sin is made its own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and does not only breed the Diſeaſe, but provide the Cure.<note n="*" place="bottom">Patimur quina peccavimus, patimur ut non peccemus.</note>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53648:391"/>Mercy, and a clear Sky ſucceeds And, then as a farther Antidote againſt the Third Source of our Misfortune, Adverſity weans our Affections, and calls them off from the World; begets in us a diſlike and diſſatisfaction to a State of ſo much Miſery; and the Bitterneſs of our Calamities ſuppies the place of Wormwood, which Providence, like a wiſe Nurſe, puts upon the Breaſt, to make us loath the Milk; and be content to part with the luſcious Delights of that deceitful Life, of which we ſhould otherwiſe be moſt immoderately fond.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Now One great, and in reality the moſt effectual Expedient to qualify a Man for this Prudent Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in Adverſity, and all the valuable Fruits of it, is for a Man to be ſtrictly Virtuous and Good. For a Man of Virtue is more eaſy, and hath a more agreeable Enjoyment of himſelf in Adverſity, than a Vicious Man hath in all the Sweets of Proſperity. As Men in Feveriſh Diſtempers feel more Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from their Cold and Hot Fits, than thoſe in perfect Health from the moſt ſcorching Heat of Summer, or the greateſt Severity of Winter-Blaſts. Thus it is with Ill Men. They carry their Diſeaſe within, and about with them; their Conſcience is feveriſh and diſorder'd, and this gives them infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater Pain, than any that Good Men are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. For theſe Perſons are ſound within; and nothing from without can hurt them: That which arms Affliction, and gives it a deadly force, is the Guilt and Reproach, the Miſgiving and Diſtruſt of one's own Mind; the Senſe of having drawn what we labour under, down upon our own heads, and the Amazing Expectation of more and worſe: But where Theſe do not put an Edge upon the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, it cannot wound very deep; and how fierce ſoever the Aſſaults may be, yet He will ſuffer but little by them, who feels all eaſy in his own Breaſt; and hath the beſt Defenſive Armour in the World to

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Adverſity is of two kinds; Either That, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in its own nature is ſuch;<note place="margin">More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> what we cannot continue Men, and not be moved with; ſuch as Sickneſs, and Pain, and the Loſs of thoſe things which are very dear to us; or elſe That, which is not really ſuch, but falſly repreſented to be ſo, and owes its being reputed ſuch, either to ſome general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Vulgar Error, or elſe to the private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and Senſe of particular Perſons. When This is the Caſe, a Man hath both his Mind and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at his own diſpoſal, juſt as before any ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions happened: And therefore in ſuch Notional Calamities, all that need or can be ſaid, is this; That what you make ſuch doleful Complaints of, hath nothing painful, or troubleſome in it; but all this is of your own creating, who put on an unneceſſary Melancholy, reſent things tenderly, cry out when you are not hurt, and fancy Miſery, where there is really none.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> As for thoſe, which are Real and Natural, the moſt Obvious,<note place="margin">Real Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions Remedies againſt them.</note> and Popular, and Sound Advice is in this Caſe the moſt Natural and moſt Equitable; and therefore without propoſing nice, and ſtudied, and uncommon Arguments, I ſhall content my ſelf with theſe few following Reflections. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Man will do well to remember, that nothing of this kind which he endures, is contrary to the Law of Nature, and the Condition of Manking; Since <hi>Man is born to Sorrow, as the Sparks fly upward;</hi> that is; All ſuch things as theſe, are very ordinary and uſual; and from his Birth entailed and annexed, as Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon this State of Mortality, into which he is admitted. Therefore upon every Accident that uſes to afflict us, we ought conſtantly to conſider Two things; The Nature of what happens to us; and our own Nature; and when once we come to regard
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53648:392"/>things as they really are, and to behave our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we ſhall then deliver our ſelves from any Vexation and Diſquiet, that can ariſe from them. Vexation and Fretfulneſs are a Diſeaſe of the Soul; a Diſtemper unnatural in it ſelf, and what ought by no means to be allowed by us. For Nature hath been ſo bountiful, and ſo very provident for our Eaſe, that there is not any Accident poſſible to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, which She hath not already furniſhed us with a Faculty to bear, and manage, and convert to our Good; and rendred capable of ſuch Arguments and Conſiderations, as may very reaſonably prevail with us to be contented under it. There is no one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life ſo deſtitute and deplorable, but it hath ſome Interval of Refreſhment; ſome Solace, ſome mitigating Circumſtance to ſoften it. There is no Confinement ſo cloſe, no Dungeon ſo dark, but ſome Light will ſpring in; ſome Comfort may be found to chear the Priſoner, and drive the Sorrow from his heart. <hi>Jonas,</hi> we ſee, found Leiſure for Devotion even in he Whale's Belly, and from thence poured out a Prayer, which God graciouſly accepted and anſwer'd. And ſure This is a Privilege of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Value; and a great kindneſs in Nature, that ſhe ſupplies us with Lenitives, and contrives whys for the qualifying and aſſwaging of our Pains, even in the inſtant of our labouring under them. This ought no more to be forgotten for ou Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Support, than that other Reflection, That our Condition neceſſarily expoſes us to Suffering, and we were born liable to all kinds of Miſery.

And how happy is it that we are thus far out of her reach? how incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably better, that ſhe ſhould tyrannize over our Riches, or Succeſſes, or even Health it ſelf, than that ſhe ſhould deprive us of our Probity, our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and our Virtue?

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> In the next place, I muſt beg of Men, that they will be Honeſt, and act according to the Rules of Reaſon and Juſtice. For the very truth is, Men are frequently very injurious to Providence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain without any Juſt cauſe. For, if at any time a croſs Accident befall us, ſhall we ſit down under it, full of Murmurings and diſcontented Thoughts? No ſure; let us rather recollect, how much oftener things have ſucceeded as we would wiſh; and then compute, and compare theſe, and balance one with the other. And I make no doubt to affirm, If this Reckoning were fairly and impartially ſtated, but the moſt Melancholy, moſt Unfortunate Man alive, might ſee greater reaſon to commend, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Good, the Succeſsful Paſſages of his Life, than to repine at any Loſſes and Diſappointments he may have ſuſtained in it. 'Tis a Reflection full of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53648:393"/>Eternal Equity, <hi>Shall we receive Good at the hand of the Lord, and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi> But it is enough to ſilence all our Grumblings, and put all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers to the bluſh, when improved with this Small, but moſt True Addition; Shall we receive Good more and oftner, and ſhall we not be content to receive the Evil, which is but little and ſeldom? Nature hath taught us to ſhut, or turn away our Eyes from all ſuch Objects as are ſhocking or offenſive to us; to remove them from ſuch Colours, as hurt and ſtrain the Sight, and to ſix upon others more gay and agreeable: There is the ſame Reaſon here, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Duty both oblige us, to call off our Thoughts from melancholy ſubjects, and to divert them with others more pleaſant and entertaining. But we ſeem to be of quite different Diſpoſitions; to feed upon the Worſt, and indulge our ſelves in Peeviſhneſs and Spight. We are like Cupping-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that draw only the foul and corrupt Blood, and let all the good alone; like Miſers, that put off their beſt Wine, and keep the worſt for their own drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; like froward Children who if you take one of their Play-things from them, throw all the reſt into the ſire, for very Rage and Vexation. Thus upon every little Miſchance, we teaze and torment our ſelves, and for the loſs of a Triſle, ceaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; nay, perfectly forget, and overlook all that we have ſtill left. Nay, ſome there are, ſuch unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſuch ungodly, ſuch unreaſonable Creatures, that you ſhall hear them call themſelves Unfortunate in every thing, and well you they never knew what Happineſs or Succeſs was; inſomuch that with theſe Wretches one Ounce of Adverſity gives more Plain, and provokes more Complaints, than Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times as much Proſperity excites Gratitude or ſenſible Satisfaction.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Another good Expedient in theſe Circumſtances, would be to look abroad into the World a little,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53648:394"/>and there obſerve the infinite multitudes of Men whoſe Condition is more grievous, more lamentable than our Own; to think ſeriouſly and compare our ſelves with the many Thouſands who envy what we repine at, and would think themſelves very happy, to exchange, and he in our caſe.

Tho indeed theſe Two do both amount to One and the ſame, and differ chiefly according to the Difference of the Perſons that apply them: <hi>viz.</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Practice for the groſs, and ignorant, and vulgar Capacities; and Meditation for the wiſe and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53648:394"/>conſiderate. Both of them obtain their intended effect by the help of Time, which is indeed the beſt Reſtorative, the ſureſt and moſt common healer of all our inward Wounds. Only it is not applied by all alike; for the Wiſe are before-hand, and prevent their Miſeries by Premeditation; the weaker Vulgar have a more expenſive and painful Cure; and that which in the Others is Foreſight, is in Theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That Cuſtom produces wonderful Effects, we ſee moſt manifeſtly, and every day proves it by Ten thouſand Inſtances; inſomuch that what at firſt appeared to be inſuperable, and inſupportable, grows in proceſs of time very tolerable and eaſy.

Men that have never uſed the Sea, tremble with fear, when they weigh Anchor, even in the calmeſt Weather; and yet the Mariners will laugh and ſing in a Storm. The young Widow is inconſolable upon the loſs of her Husband, and thinks of nothing but Sorrow and Deſpair for the remainder of her Days; but a very few Months aſſwage this violent Paſſion and the Concern wears off ſo faſt, that before the year of Mourning comes about, 'tis odds but you find her in the Arms of a Second Bridegroom. Thus Time and Practice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things; and the greateſt grievance in moſt of our Diſaſters, is that they are new, and uncouth; but all That abates of it ſelf, and a little converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and better acquaintance reconciles us very well to them.</p>

Foreſight is therefore an Admirable Preſervative againſt all manner of Misfortunes, becauſe by this Attention of Mind we have formed the whole thing in our Imaginations before, and ſo they cannot make any mighty alteration in us, when they come in good earneſt.

Meditation and Reaſoning is the very Temper of the Soul; this ſteels and hardens it, fortifies it againſt Aſſaults, and renders it impenetrable againſt all that can attempt to wound or break it.

                        <p> Now the Method of attaining to this wiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Foreſight, is firſt to convince our ſelves, and be very duly ſenſible how craggy and rough a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature hath placed us in; That Nothing is ſtable in this World, but We and All about us totter, and are in perpetual danger of falling; That whatever hath happen'd to Another Man, might every jot as well happen to Us; and the Fate, which hangs over Every Head, may fall down, and cruſh Any; and in all our Deſigns and Undertakings, carefully to form to our ſelves the Diſappointments, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, to which they are any way liable; that ſo, if any of Theſe, ſhall afterwards fall to our Lot, we may not be confounded, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happen'd to us. Alas! how infinitely do we cheat and fool our ſelves, by propoſing only the fair and inviting Side, and turning all the diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Circumſtances out of ſight? How miſerably do we betray our want of Judgment, by never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that our Neighbours Misfortunes to day, may be Ours before to morrow; that we are by no means exempt, and out of reach. But how fooliſhly do They argue, who prefer a blind Fool-hardineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and pretend that a Computation of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Accidents would diſcourage and put a ſtop to all Action? As if a Man might not be prudent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deſpondency, nor diſtruſt Fortune without Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution, and Cowardice, and Panick Fear. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if we would repreſent Things to our ſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they really are, and as Reaſon directs; we ſhould be ſo far from Surprize at Croſſes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, that it would rather appear matter of Wonder and Aſtoniſhment, that ſo very few befall us, in compariſon of what we had ground enough to expect; and when ſo many Accidents are always dogging us cloſe at the Heels, that they ſhould be ſo long before they overtake us; and when they have us in their Clutches, and we lye at their Mercy,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53648:396"/>that they ſhould not treat us more ruggedly, than the Generality of them do. For He, that ſees another Perſon's Ill Fortune, and regards it as a thing ſo uſual and common, that his own turn may very probably be next, This Man is armed againſt it, and hath vanquiſhed his Foe, before he makes his Approaches. Nothing in theſe Caſes ſhould be left unconſider'd, and it is very adviſable to reckon upon the worſt; thus Events will mend upon us, and a great part of what comes, will be clear Gains. But it is fooliſh to ſink under a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and think to excuſe one's Weakneſs, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, We never imagined Matters would be ſo bad. It is a very common Saying, <hi>That when a Man is ſurprized, he is half beaten;</hi> and then by the Rule of Contraries, a Man forearmed is worth Two others. A wiſe Prince will make Preparations for War in the Times of profoundeſt Peace; a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sailor, lays in freſh Tackle, and all manner of Proviſions for the weathering a Storm, and refitting after it, before ever he ſets ſail out of Port; For when the Miſchief is actually upon us, 'tis too late to provide againſt it. Beſides, There is this farther Advantage attends a Premeditation, that let a thing be never ſo difficult in it ſelf, every Man finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dextrous to a wonder, in Matters that he hath been a great while prepared for; Preſence of Mind, Prudence in Choice, and Boldneſs in Execution, give infinite Advantage in ſuch Caſes, and almoſt inſure the Succeſs. Whereas on the other hand, ther eis nothing ſo obvious and eaſy in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Men are confounded and at a loſs, if they be utterly unacquainted with it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Id videndum ne quid inopinatum ſit nobis, qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Authority.</hi> And this is ſupported upon two Baſes; Admiration and Fear; both which muſt go together, and jointly contribute to the keeping it up.

Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Decrees, that is, in the Law, which is a Prince's Maſter-piece, and the Nobleſt Copy of that Incommunicable Majeſty, whereof himſelf is the Original; And by this Law it is, that Fools are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Evil, informed in Good, governed and led to know and do, what is convenient for their own, and neceſſary for the Publick Intereſt.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Authority is ſtated, fix'd, and agreed upon; but there is Another,<note place="margin">Cuſtom.</note> which comes neareſt of any up to it, commonly called Cuſtom; a very Powerful, but withal a very Poſitive and Imperious Miſtreſs. This Power is all gained by Encroachment and Uſurpation, by Treachery and Force; it get foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Inches, and ſteals in upon the World inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The Beginnings of it are ſmall and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; gentle and humble; and frequently owing to Men's Tameneſs or Neglect; their Lazineſs, and Yielding; the Influenc of Example, and the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Inconſideration; but when it hath once taken Root, and is fix'd by Time, it puts on a ſtern domineering Look, iſſues out its Orders, plays the Tyrant, and will be obſerved; It is to no purpoſe then to argue for Liberty and Right; no Man is ſuffered to ſpeak, to move, to look, in contradiction to ſuch an Eſtabliſhment. It ſtops your Mouth with Poſſeſſion and Precedent; which indeed are its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53648:398"/>and only Pleas of Title, grows great and more eminent, the farther it goes; and, like Rivers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges its Name and Channel by rowling; inſomuch, that even, when the Miſchiefs and Inconvenience of its ſtill prevailing are manifeſt, yet is it not ſafe to reduce it to its firſt Infant-State; and Men are oftentimes better adviſed in ſuffering under it, than in attempting to diſuſe, or reverſe it.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If now we compare theſe Two together; it will be found,<note place="margin">Law and Cuſtom compared.</note> that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> eſtabliſh their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by very different Methods. Cuſtom creeps upon us by little and little, by length of Time, by gentle and acceptable Means, by the Favour and general Conſent, or at leaſt with the Approbation of the Majority; and its Beginning, Growth, Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, are all from the People. The Law, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits none of theſe flow Proceedings; it is Born at once, and in full Perfection; comes to Vigor and Maturity in a Moment; it marches out with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power, and receives its Efficacy from the Supreme Commander; it depends not always upon the good liking of the Subjects, but is frequently full ſore againſt their Wills; and yet prevails, and takes place, though burdenſome and ungrateful to them. This laſt Conſideration is the Reaſon, why Some have compared Law to a Tyrant, and Cuſtom to a King. Again, Cuſtom, though otherwiſe never ſo engaging, yet never propoſes Rewards or Penalties; But the Law propounds both, and to be ſure threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Penalties upon the Diſobedient at leaſt. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe Differences, the matter is ſo order'd, that theſe Two are frequently capable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtrengthning, and mutually aſſiſting, or of deſtroying and overthrowing each other. For Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying and overthrowing each other. For Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, though in ſtrictneſs it be only upon Sufferance, yet when countenanc'd and publickly allowed by the Prince, will be ſtill more firm and ſecure; and the Law likewiſe gets ground upon the People, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53648:399"/>ſtands the faſter by means of Poſſeſſion, and long Uſage. On the Contrary; Cuſtom will be quaſhed by a Law prohibiting the Continuance of it; and a Law will go down the ſtream, and be loſt to all the purpoſes and effects of it, if a contrary Cuſtom be connived at. Thus, I ſay, they may interfere to the Prejudice of each other; but uſually they go hand in hand, and are in reality almoſt the ſame thing, conſidered under different reſpects; The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and more diſcerning Men conſidering That as a Law, which the Ignorant and Vulgar, who have little Notions of a Legiſlative Power, or its Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, obſerve purely as a thing Cuſtomary, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been in uſe, without attending how it came to be ſo.</p>

It is ſcarce poſſible to think of any Imagination ſo whimſical and odd, but ſome Country or other hath received it as a Cuſtom, or eſtabliſhed it by a Law. I will give my ſelf the trouble of inſtancing in ſeveral up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, to convince Thoſe, who perhaps cannot eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be perſuaded, how much Truth there is in this Obſervation. And here, not to inſtance in Religion, which in the Idolatrous and leſs civiliz'd Countries eſpecially, hath had groſſer Deceits, more abominable Abſurdities, and more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Variety of theſe, than any other Subject what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; yet, becauſe it does not fall ſo directly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs of our preſent Argument, I ſhall paſ it over at preſent; and confine my ſelf to the Head of Civil Commerce; in which alone Cuſtoms, properly ſo called, are uſed to take place; and where the Matter being exceeding obvious to every Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is ſo much the more aſtoniſhing, that Men ſhould be carried into ſuch Extravagances. Now Thoſe, which I think moſt remarkable, and ſit to be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53648:399"/>mentioned, are ſuch as follow. The Reputing it an Inſtance of Affection and Duty when Parents live to a certain term of Years, for their Children to Kill, and to Eat them; In Inns and other Publick Houſes of Accommodation, inſtead of diſcharging the Reckoning with Money, to lend their Wives and Daughters to the Hoſt for Payment; The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Wives in common; The ſetting up Publick Stews for Young Men; The eſteeming it honura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for Women to be Common, and wearing Tufts of Fringe at their Garments by way of Boaſt and Glory, to ſignify the Number of their Gallants; The ſuffering Single Women to abandon themſelves to all manner of Filthineſs, and publickly to procure Abortions when with Child; but of all Married Women requiring the ſtricteſt Chaſtity, and Fidelity to their Husbands imaginable; The Marrying of Men to one another; The Women going to War, and engaging in Battel along with their Husbands; Wives dying, and laying violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either at the inſtant, or very quickly after the Death of their Husbands; The allowing Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows a Liberty of Marrying again, provided their former Husbands died by a Violent death; but if otherwiſe, then debarring them of that Privilege. Inveſting Husbands with an Abſolute, Unlimited, Uncontroulable Power over their Wives; to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce them at Pleaſure, without being obliged to ſhew Cauſe; to ſell them off, if they bring no Children; to Kill them without any manner of Provocation, merely by virtue of this Deſpotick Power, and the Relation the Wife ſtands in to him, and to borrow afterwards from other People; Women to Bear Children without any manner of Terror, or Complaint; Killing their Childen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not Handſome, not Beautiful in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; not well-Featured, Crooked, or ill Shap'd, or without aſſigning any Reaſon at all; The Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53648:400"/>altogether upon Man's Fleſh; The Eating Fleſh and Fiſh quite Raw; the Lodging Perſons of all Ages and Sexes indifferently, to the Number of Ten or Twelve together; Making the putting their Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er down to the Ground, and afterwards pointing with it up to Heaven, the common Form of Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Turning their Back upon the Perſon they Addreſs, and make a Civility to; and taking it for a conſtant Rule, never to look at the Perſon, to whom you deſign Honour and Reſpect; Obſerving it as a Mark of Duty to gather up the Spittle of Princes in their Hands; Never ſpeaking to the King, but through a long Trunk; Never cutting the Hair or Nails during their whole Lives; To Shave the Hair on One ſide, and Pare the Nails of One Hand, but never to do it of the Other; The Boring Holes in the Cheeks, and other parts sof the Face, to wear Pendants, and Jewels at, and the ſame at the Breaſts and Nipples; Abſolutely to deſpiſe Death; to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it with Feaſting and Joy; to contend and quarrel for it; nay, to plead and ſue for it in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as if it were ſome remarkable Dignity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Favour; and to look upon the granting theſe Suits, and being preferred before other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors in them, as a ſingular Honour; The Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the moſt Honourable way of diſpoſing their dead Bodies, and much more glorious than any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, to be Eaten up of Dods, and Fowls of the Air, and to be Boiled or Baked, Dried and Pounded to Powder, and that Duſt mingled with Men's ordinary Drink.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now, whatever Diverſion the relating ſuch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms as theſe,<note place="margin">Cuſtoms Examined and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> or whatever wonder it may create, yet if we come a little cloſer to the matter, and once undertake to paſs a Judgment upon them, all then is noiſe and ſcuffle, eager and endleſs quarrel. The Common People are ſo over-run with Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and Pedantick Folly, that They, according to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53648:400"/>their uſual Wiſdom, run all down at a venture; and without more ado, condemn every thing for Barbarous and Brutiſh, which is not juſt according to their own Palate, that is, which does not agree with the received Practice and Cuſtoms of their own Country. For they, never looking Abroad, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what is done there, can ſee no manner of Reaſon, why their own Local Uſages at Home, ſhould not be the only, and unalterable Standard of Truth, and Juſtice, and Decency, all the World over. If you endeavour to infuſe ſome larger No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Theſe Matters, by telling them, That Other People of their Capacity are even with them; That they are every jot as much out of conceit with Our Methods, as we can be with Theirs; they cut you ſhort immediately, by replying, <hi>You may ſee by that how Barbarous and Brutiſh they are;</hi> whih is but ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing over again; and here they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſtick. But now a Wiſe Man is more reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and allows a greater Latitude; he gives them a fair hearing at leaſt, and does not determine haſtily, for fear of too much warmth, and wronging his Judgment; and he is certainly in the right; for there are really a great many Laws and Uſages, which, at firſt ſight, appear inſufferably Barbarous, contrary to all the Notions of Humanity and ſound Reaſon, and yet if they were ſoberly conſidered, (all Paſſion and Prejudice apart) if they did not ſo far approve themſelves to our Judgment, as to be allowed Juſt and Good, yet it would be found that they are not deſtitute of all Colour of Reaſon; but have a great deal to be ſaid in their Vindication; and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments plauſible enough to excuſe Other Men's Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, thoughnot enough to recommend them to our Own.</p>
                        <p>Let us now, for inſtance, make the Experiment in thoſe Two firſt mentioned, which, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſeem extremely odd, and the moſt diſtant that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53648:401"/>can be, from all the Apprehenſions we commonly entertain of the Duty and Affection we owe to Thoſe who brought us into the World, and were at the Trouble and Expence of our Suſtenance and Education. Theſe Cuſtoms then are the Killing one's Parents, when they come into ſuch particular Circumſtances; and Eating their dead Bodies. The People who receive this Cuſtom, look upon it as the higheſt Teſtimony of Piety and Reſpect; the laſt and fulleſt Proof of their Tenderneſs and ſincere Affection. The great deſign they have in it is Compaſſion to their old decrepit Parents, whom they think themſelves under the ſtricteſt Obligations to deliver from a ſtate of Miſery and Infirmity; a State, that renders them, not only utterly Uſeleſs to Themſelves and to every Body elſe, but even a Trouble and a Burthen; a State of Languiſhing and Decay, of Uneaſineſs and Pain; that makes Life a Wearineſs and a Torment to themſelves and all about them; and therefore they think That Death which gives them Eaſe and Reſt, and puts them paſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any more, a very profitable Exchange, a Gain, which they might be glad to chuſe, and thankful for receiving. When they have done them this Kindneſs, (as they eſteem it) the next Proof of their Dutiful Regard, is to give them the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Burial in their power: And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they make their own Bodies their Repoſitory; lodging theſe Carkaſſes and precious Relicks in their own Bowels; thus in ſome meaſure conveying a new Life, and recruiting their periſhed Nature, by Digeſting, and turning to Nouriſhment this dead Fleſh of their Parents, and Tranſubſtantiating it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own living Fleſh. Theſe Reaſons are not ſo very Contemptible; at leaſt, I am apt to believe, they may ſomewhat abate that Deteſtation, which the prejudice of a contrary Opinion is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the generality of People. A Man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53648:401"/>impartially, will, I believe, allow, That the Perſons who have been brought up to this Cuſtom, may think it ſo plauſible a one, that it will not be eaſy to bring them off from it; Nay, that it may appear in the Eyes of theſe Perſons, a horrible Cruelty, and Abomination, to ſee their Aged Parents lie Languiſhing before their Eyes, in the midſt of Sickneſs and Pain, and Faint Strugglings for the wretched Remnants of Life; without any kind Hand to do the good Office of ſetting them at Reſt. And when Declining Nature hath finiſhed its own Courſe, it is no hard matter to imagine, that Theſe People ſhould with Reluctancy and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Interr theſe Spoils of Thoſe, who gave them Being; that they might think it a Neglect and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to caſt thoſe Remains they ſo dearly Love into a Hole, to Rot in the Earth, to Corrupt and become Food for Worms; that This is the greateſt Diſregard they can poſſibly be guilty of, and a very ill Expreſſion of Tenderneſs and Duty.</p>
                        <p>And, that this Suppoſition is not ſo very much out of the way, we have plain matter of Fact to prove: For <hi>Darius</hi> made the Experiment, and found it to be exactly as I have put the Caſe. He firſt demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſome <hi>Grecians,</hi> upon what Terms they would be content to take the <hi>Indian</hi> Cuſtom of Eating the Bodies of their Deceaſed Parents; and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was; What! do ſo Barbarous a thing, as Eat our own Fathers? We could not do it at any rate! Then again he attempted to perſuade the <hi>Indians,</hi> That they would Burn the Bodies of their Parents, after the manner of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and he found Theſe a great deal more averſe to his Propoſal, and more difficult to be perſuaded, than the Other. Give me leave here only to add one Inſtance more of Men's different ways of Reaſoning in a Trifling Matter, and ſuch as only concerns Decency and Civility. A Man that uſed to wipe his Noſe upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53648:402"/>his Fingers, being reproved for ſo unmannerly a Trick; deſired in his own vindication, to know, what Privilege that ſilthy Excrement had above all the reſt, that we muſt pay it the reſpect of a fine Handkerchief, and then, as if it were ſome valuable Treaſure, wrap it up cloſe, and carry it in one's Pocket: That in all reaſon this ſhould rather turn one's Stomach, and give offence, than throwing it careleſly away. Thus you ſee how few things there are, for which ſome probable Reaſon may not be alledged; and This ſhould be a warning to us, not to condemn Things haſtily and raſhly, but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſides of the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But after all, the Power of Cuſtom is incredible; no Man can conceive eaſily,<note place="margin">The force of Cuſtom.</note> how abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled an Authority it exerciſes over Mankind. He that called it a Second Nature, came far ſhort of the Truth; for it is equal, it is ſuperior to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it even contends with, it triumphs over, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whence, I pray, comes it to paſs that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers never fall in Love with their own Daughters, though never ſo charming and deſirable Creatures? Or why are Siſters ſeldom or never ſmitten with their own Brothers, though infinitely handſomer, better accompliſh'd, and more engaging than Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? This Reſervation and Coldneſs does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly proceed from Nature; She makes no ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions; Theſe are the Effect of general Cuſtoms and Poſitive Laws, who forbid ſuch Mixtures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them Scandalous, and Horrid, Inceſtuous and Wicked; but again, I ſay, theſe Characters are fix'd by Divine or Human Inſtitutions; for Nature knows no ſuch thing as Inceſt, nor condemns any Alliances, let the Line or Relation be what it will.</p>

                        <p>Farther yet; Cuſtom commits a Violence upon the Rules of Nature, and overbears them; witneſs that daily practice of Phyſicians, who frequently forſake the Theory, and ſet aſide what Art and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do both concur in, ſo far as the Rules and Grounds of their Profeſſion can diſcover or direct; and take a different courſe with their Patients, in Deference to Experience, and common Succeſs; Witneſs again thoſe People, who have wrought a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53648:403"/>perfect Change in their Conſtitutions, even ſo as to Eat, nay to live upon Poiſon; Spiders and Ants, Lizards and Toads; as ſeveral whole Nations are ſaid to do in the <hi>Indies.</hi> Cuſtom does likewiſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify our Senſes, and alter the Temper of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and the quality of the Impreſſion, and the Report made from it. To this purpoſe are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we read of thoſe People, who dwell near the Cataracts of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> and indeed a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, or a Steeple, or a Brazier's Shop will in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion have the ſame Effect; and, if you give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to ſome Old Philoſophers, All the World are deaf to the Muſick of the Spheres, which is nothing elſe, but the different Motions of the ſeveral Orbs turning round upon their own Axis, and variouſly juſtling and interfering with one another. In one word, The great and Maſter-workmanſhip of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is, That it ſubdues and conquers Nature, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhes every Difficulty; makes thoſe things eaſy by degrees, which ſeemed unattainable and impoſſible; and the Bitterneſs of pain and Suffering it wears out, and ſoftens, till at laſt our Complaints ceaſe, and we are reconciled, even to our Miſeries themſelves. Nay it does not only produce Content, and lay aſleep the ſenſitive Soul, but it manages and domineers over the Rational one too; and exerciſes a moſt unjuſt, and arbitrary Power, over our Imaginations, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It makes and unmakes at pleaſure: Gives and takes away Reputation and Eſteem; without, nay ſometimes, againſt Reaſon. It brings Notions in Philoſophy, in Religion, in Politicks, Opinions and Ceremonies, Faſhions and Modes of Living into credit; though they be never ſo fantaſtical and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; never ſo uncouth and diſtant from what Reaſon and Judgment would teach and approve. Nor is its Tyranny leſs formidable in the contrary Extreme; for it as frequently does great wrong, to things in themſelves noble, and worthy of univerſal
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53648:403"/>Advantage, by diſparaging and leſſening them, and even bringing them into Neglect, and univerſal Contempt. So unreaſonably does Cuſtom and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame raiſe or lower the Market; ſo precarious and uncertain is the greateſt intrinſick Worth, if it happen to be lodged in an Obſolete Opinion, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated and Unfaſhionable Virtue; For all theſe things have their Seaſons of Improvement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion; and the Sentiments of the World upon them will vary, though the Reaſon and Nature of the thing be conſtantly the ſame.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I add in the Second Place, that This be done out of Reverence to Publick Authority.<note place="margin">Not merely for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity of them.</note> For ſtrictly ſpeaking, theſe Laws and Cuſtom, ſupport their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and ought to preſerve an Authority, not merely with regard to any inherent Equity or Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53648:405"/>to be diſcovered in them; but they are ſacred upon this ſingle Conſideration, That they are Laws and Cuſtoms, though there be nothing elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to our Obſervance. This is the Myſtical Foundation upon which they ſtand, and the great Secret of Government; and, properly ſpeaking, they have no other Motive but their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to enforce them. My meaning is not from hence, That any Eſtabliſhment, though never ſo ſtrong, can derive a Right to our Obedience, upon Laws and Uſages, manifeſtly Unreaſonable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; but that He who obeys a Law, merely for the ſake of its Subject-matter being juſt, though he do the thing commanded by it, yet he does it upon a wrong Principle. For at this rate every Law muſt ſubmit it ſelf to the Judgment of every private Man; and each Subject ſhall call it to account, arraign and try it at the Bar of his own Breaſt; bring all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be a Matter of Controverſy and Doubt, and by conſequence, all the Right of Adminiſtration, and the whole Civil Polity muſt truckle and ſubmit, not only to the Fickleneſs and Variety of infinite ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Judgments; but to the Changeable and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome Sentiments of one and the ſame Perſon. That which binds the Law upon Men's Conſciences, is the Authority of the Legiſlative Power; and the Sanction it receives from thence; the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Duty contained in it is only an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and collateral Obligation. How many Laws have there been in the World ſo far from any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Piety or Juſtice, that they have really been exceeding trifling, extravagant, and ſenſleſs; ſuch as no Man's Reaſon knew what to make of? And yet Mankind have ſubmitted, nay, and enjoyed as much Peace, and good Order, and been as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly governed, as highly contented; as if they had been the Juſteſt and moſt reaſonable, that ever Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wiſdom and Policy enacted. Now, he that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53648:405"/>ſhould have gone about to create a Diſſatisfaction and Diſlike to ſuch Laws, or attempted to repeal, or to amend them, would have deſerved to be ſuſpected as an Enemy to the Publick, and not to be endured or harken'd to in a wiſe Government. There are very few things, but Human Nature may in proceſs of Time reconcile it ſelf to; and when once the Difficulty is overcome, and things ſit eaſy upon Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is no better in effect, than an Act of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to offer at the diſſetling them again. We ſhould always be content to let the World jog on in its own beaten Path; for it is but too often ſeen, that your Removers of Ancient Land-marks, and buſy Politicians, under their plauſible Pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, ſpoil, and ruin All.</p>
                        <p>There is ſeldom or never any conſiderable Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in eſtabliſhed Laws, received Opinions, acknowledged Cuſtoms, and ancient Ordinances, and Diſcipline; but it is of very pernicious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The Attempt is always extremely hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; there is commonly more Hurt than Good done by it; at leaſt this deſerves to be duly weighed; That the Miſchief, if leſs in it ſelf, is yet ſooner felt; for the Diſorders every Change creates are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſent, but the Advantages it produces are diſtant and doubtful; ſo that we exchange a Good in Poſſeſſion, for one in Expectation only; and where we ſubmit to That, there ought to be very great Odds in value, to juſtify the Prudence of our Proceeding. This is certain, that Men are but too fond of Novelties, before they have tried them; and Innovators never want ſome very fair and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pretences, to catch and feed their Fancies with; but the more of this kind they pretend, the more ought we to ſuſpect and be aware of them. For how indeed can we forbear deteſting the vain and ambitious Preſumption of Perſons, who undertake to ſee farther, and be wiſer than all Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides?
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53648:406"/>What an intolerable Arrogance is it in ſuch Turbulent and Factious Spirits, to perſuade Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Compliance with their Humours, at the Expence of the Publick Peace, and to think it worth while, that the Government ſhould run the Riſque of its own Ruin, merely for the ſake of eſtabliſhing a freſh Scheme, and paſſing a private Opinion into an Univerſal Law?</p>
                        <p>I have already hinted, and do repeat it here again, That we are not by any means obliged to obey all Laws and Conſtitutions whatſoever, which our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors ſhall think fit to impoſe, without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or Reſerve; For where we find them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to contradict the Laws of God and Nature, in ſuch caſe, we muſt neither comply on the one hand, nor diſturb the Publick Peace by our refuſing to do ſo on the other. How Men ought to behave themſelves in ſuch Critical Junctures, will fall more properly under Conſideration, when we come in the next Book to treat of our Duty to Princes. And indeed this Inconvenience is much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon Subjects, with regard to Their Arbitrary Commands, than the Eſtabliſhed Laws. Nor is it ſufficient, that we ſubmit to Laws and Governors, upon the account of their Juſtice, and particular Worth; but this muſt not be done ſervilely, and cowardly, upon Motives of Fear and Force; This is a Principle ſit only for the Meaneſt and moſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; it is part of a Wiſe Man's Character, to do nothing unwillingly and upon Compulſion, but to delight in his Duty, and find a ſenſible Pleaſure in a reaſonable Obedience. He keeps the Laws, for his own ſake; becauſe he is jealous and tender of doing any thing he ought not, and a rigid Maſter over himſelf. He needs no Laws to conſtrain him, in what is decent and good. This diſtinguiſhes Him from the Common Populace, who have no other Senſe or Direction of their Duty, but what Poſitive
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53648:406"/>Laws can give. In ſtrictneſs, according to the old <hi>Stoical</hi> Notions, the Wiſe Man is above the Laws, and a Law to himſelf. But however, he pays all outward Deference to them, and a free voluntary Obedience, This is due from him as a Member of Society, as the inward Freedom of his Mind is owing to the Prerogative of a Philoſopher.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In the Third Place, I affirm it to be the Effect of extreme Levity, a Preſumption, vain in it ſelf, and injurious to others; nay, a Mark of great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inſufficiency of Judgment, to Condemn all thoſe Laws and Cuſtoms abroad, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe of our own Native Countrey. This indeed is owing either to want of Leiſure and Opportunity, or to want of Ability, and Largeneſs of Mind for the conſidering the Reaſons and Grounds impartially, upon which Foreign Eſtabliſhments are founded. It is a great Wrong done to our own Judgment, to pronounce a Raſh Sentence, which, when we come to a more perfect underſtanding of the Cauſe, we ſhall in many Inſtances, find our ſelves obliged to retract, and be aſhamed of. And it is an Argument that we forget the Extent and Condition of Human Nature; how many, and how different things it is ſuſceptible of. It is a ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Eyes of our Mind, and ſuffering them to be laid aſleep, and deluded, with the often repeated Impreſſions of the ſame thing, the daily Dream of Long Uſe; and to ſubmit ſo far to Precedent and Preſcription, that Theſe ſhould overbear the plaineſt Reaſon; and give Example the Aſcendent over Judgment.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, It is the Buſineſs and the Character of a generous Mind, and ſuch a Wiſe Man, as I am here drawing the Idea of, to examine all things. Firſt, To take each apart, and conſider it by it ſelf; Then to lay them one over againſt another, and compare them together; that ſo the ſeveral Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53648:407"/>of the whole World, ſo far as they ſhall come to his Knowledge, may have a full and a fair Trial; and that, not for the directing his Obedience, but to aſſert his Right, and execute his Office. When This is done, he ought to paſs an honeſt and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment upon them, as he ſhall find them, upon this enquiry, to be agreeable, or otherwiſe, with Truth, and Reaſon, and Univerſal Juſtice; For This is the Rule, This the Standard, which all of them are to be Tried and Meaſured by. To Theſe we are Principally and Originally engaged; nor may we ſo far falſify our Obligations, as to depart from Them in favour of any Cuſtoms; or to ſuffer our Judgments to be debauched with falſe Notions, though our National Conſtitutions were Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times dearer to us, than it is poſſible to ſuppoſe them For Theſe can only claim a Secondary Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; the Former was general, and concerned us as Men; This only binds us as Subjects, or Natives of ſuch a determinate place; and ſo the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is limited and particular; and if we pay our outward Obſervance, and ſubmit in our Behaviour to theſe Municipal Injunctions, this part of our Duty is diſcharged; and all Parties have reaſon to be ſatisfied. It is true, Things may ſo fall out, that in compliance with this Second, this particular, and Local Obligation, (that is, in conformity to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Place where we dwell) we may do ſomething, that does not appear to Us in every point Agreeable to the Primitive and Univerſal one; that is, ſuch as Nature and Reaſon do not dictate, nor evince the Equity of; but we ſtill are true to this Obligation, by reſerving our Judgment for it, acknowledging that what Nature ſuggeſts, and Univerſal Equity dictates, ought to be preferred; and continuing firm in our Opinions, that This is always beſt, though it be the Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our particular Conſtitution not to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53648:407"/>according to it. For after all, our Judgment is the only thing we can call our Own, and all we have left to diſpoſe of; the World hath nothing to do with our Thoughts. Our External Behaviour, 'tis true, the Publick lays claim to, This we ought to pay, and muſt be accountable for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus far our Laws and Uſages take place. We may very juſtly do, what we cannot approve for any Juſtice or Goodneſs of its own; and Obey Laws, which have nothing of that intrinſick Excellence, that, had we been in Power, or perfectly Free, we ſhould either have Enacted, or made Choice of them. A great deal muſt be foregone for the ſake of Order and Quiet; for, in ſhort, there is no Remedy; This is the Condition of the World, and, as matters ſtand, Mankind could not ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Next in order to the Two former Governeſſes, Law and Cuſtom, ſucceeds a Third; who with a great many is eſteemed of equal Authority with Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Former; and indeed, Thoſe that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and enſlave themſelves to her, ſhe treats with a more tyrannical, and unrelenting Severity, than Either of the Former does. And This is <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> which in plain Engliſh, is for the moſt part no better, than a ſet Form of Vanity. But yet, through Littleneſs of Soul, and the ſpreading depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mind and Manners, ſo very general among Men; it hath gained ſo undeſerved Honour and Reputation, and uſurped ſuch a Power, and is ſo inſolent in the Exerciſe of it, that a great many People are poſſeſs'd with an Opinion, That Wiſdom conſiſts in a nice Obſervance of it. Under this Notion of the Thing, they tamely come to the Yoke, and liſt themſelves its moſt willing Slaves; inſomuch, that their Health, their Convenience ſhall ſuffer and be loſt; Buſineſs be diſappointed; Liberty be ſold or given up; Conſcience violated; God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53648:408"/>neglected; rather than they will ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to offend againſt one of the leaſt, and niceſt Punctilio's.

Now I am very deſirous, That the Wife Man of my Forming ſhould by no means ſuffer himſelf to be thus Captivated and Impoſed upon. Not that I would have him Singular and Moroſe, as if Wiſdom conſiſted in Rudeneſs, and acting in Deſiance of Ceremony; for ſome Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be made to the way of the World; and all the outward Conformity we can ſhew, is ſit to be paid to the Manners of it, provided always, That this Compliance do not thwart other more weighty Conſiderations. For thus much I muſt needs inſiſt upon, That my Scholar never bind himſelf without reſerve, nor be ſo abſolutely Devoted to theſe ſorts of Reſpect, but that, when he ſhall ſind it Neceſſary, in point of Duty, or otherwiſe ſhall ſee fit, he may have the Courage to Diſpenſe with, and ſhew, that he can Deſpiſe theſe little Niceties. And This I would have done with ſo viſible a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Gallantry of Soul; that all the World may be ſatisfied, it is not Humour and Affectation, nor Ignorance, or ſordid Neglect, which moves him to a Behaviour different from Theirs; but that he is acted by a right Judgment, and juſter Notions of the matter; which will not let him value theſe poor things more highly than they deſerve; that even where his outward Comportment is ſuited to the Practice, his Will and Judgment are entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, and have not been perverted to a falſe Approbation and Eſteem: In ſhort, That, however

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now this is a Subject, which offers it ſelf to us under a Twofold Conſideration, and conſequently this Chapter which diſcourſes of it, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be divided into Two Parts; according to the Two different ſorts of Converſation, which Men uſe, and are engaged in, with the World. One of theſe is ſimple, general, at large, and in common; ſuch as is made up of our ordinary Company, and that Indifferency in Commerce and Acquaintance,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53648:409"/>which ſome accidental Occaſion, or Buſineſs, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling together, or Meeting in Third Places, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interviews at places of Publick Reſort, or the Civilities of Viſits and Complemental Ceremonies, do every day lead us into; and ſo increaſe, or leſſen the number of our Acquaintance, introduce new Familiarities, or change our Old; All, or ſome of which, happen not only with thoſe we know, but with ſuch as we never knew nor ſaw before: And This is a Correſpondence and Converſation wholly owing to Fortune, and Formality; our own Choice hath nothing to do with it, nor did we ſeek or take pains to procure, or contract it. The Other ſort of Converſation may be called Particular; becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſuch Companions as we like and love; Acquaintance of our own deſiring; ſuch as we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induſtriouſly ſought, and choſe to recommend our ſelves to; or elſe ſuch as when offered to Us, was moſt willingly embraced, and that with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Advantage to our ſelves; either for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Minds, or the advancing our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or ſome other Profit or Pleaſure, which we hope to reap from an Intimacy with them. And here, we are not to conſider ſuch a ſuperſicial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce as before, but that which is ſtricter and more endearing, cloſe Conferences, mutual Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſecret Confidences, and great Familiarity. Each of which require diſtinct Rules, and ſhall have Directions apart. But before we enter upon either of theſe Conſiderations, I beg the Readers leave, to lay down One general Rule, which regards them both; and is in truth a Fundamental Principle in the Caſe before us; for which reaſon I chuſe to place it here, as a neceſſary Introduction to every part of the ſubſequent Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> One very great Vice, which, the Wiſe-man I am all this while forming,<note place="margin">Eaſineſs of Humour.</note> muſt be ſure to keep himſelf clear of; (and indeed a moſt Unſeaſonable and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53648:409"/>Troubleſome ill Quality it is, both to ones ſelf, and to all he converſes with) is the being particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſome certain Humours, to keep always in the ſame road of Converſation. This brings a man into ſlavery to himſelf, to be ſo inſeparably wedded to his own Inclination, and Fancy, that he can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no occaſion be prevailed with to comply, nor be agreeable to other People; and 'tis a certain ſign of a perverſe and unſociable Diſpoſition; the Effect of ill-nature and ill-breeding; of unreaſonable Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, Partiality, and Selfconceitedneſs: The Men of this Temper have a rare time on't; for, whereever they come, they are ſure to meet with Objects enough, either to try their Patience, or to raiſe a Controverſy. On the other hand, It argues great Wiſdom, and Sufficiency, when a Man hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command of his Temper, ſo that he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf to all Companies; and is of ſuch a flexible and manageable Spirit, that he can riſe and fall with the Company, be pleaſant or ſerious, keep pace, and conſtantly make one, with what he finds the reſt diſpoſed to. And indeed the beſt and braveſt Men have always the largeſt and moſt general Souls; and nothing argues Greatneſs of Mind more, than this univerſal Temper; the being always in good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, free, and open, and generous in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a Character ſo beautiful, that it in ſome meaſure reſembles God himſelf, and is a Copy of his Communicative Goodneſs: And among other things ſaid in Honour of Old <hi>Cato,</hi> this is one Noble Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;<note n="*" place="bottom">Huic verſatile ingenium; Sic pariter ad omnia ſuit, ut na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad id unum dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon it.</note> I am now upon; let us return to the former part of the Diviſion, which concerns what I called Simple, and General, and Common Converſation; in diſtinction from that other, which is Choſen, and Intimate, and Particular.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now for Our Behaviour in this Point; there are ſeveral things very proper and neceſſary to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the Firſt thing I would adviſe, is, To be very Reſerved and Modeſt in our Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Second is, Not to be out of humour with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fooliſh, or indiſcreet thing; every little Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or Levity, which want of better Senſe, or better Breeding, or ſome unthinking Gaiety of mind may betray Men to: For we are to conſider, when in Company, that we are in ſome degree diſpoſed of to Others, and no longer entirely our Own; ſo that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Thing to have been otherwiſe than it ought, and better let alone; yet it is troubleſome, and impertinent in Us to take offence at every thing, which is not juſt as we would have it, or think it ought to be.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Third is, Not to be too profuſe of ſpeaking all we know; but to play the good Husbands, and manage the Stock of our Underſtanding prudently. For Reſervedneſs is not unbecoming even the wiſeſt, and beſt provided for Diſcourſe; ſo far as it argues a Deference to the reſt of the Company, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines that Aſſuming way of talking All. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is adviſeable, that Men ſhould be more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hear, than to ſpeak; and converſe, rather with a proſpect of informing Themſelves, than with an Intention to teach the Company. For indeed 'tis a very great ſault, to be more forward in ſetting ones ſelf on, and Talking to ſhew ones Parts; than to Learn the Worth, and to be truly acquainted with the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of other Men: He that makes it his buſineſs not

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Fourth is, Not to lie upon the Catch for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes; nor to ſhew our Wit, by perpetually entring into Argument; and even, when it is proper to do ſo, with regard to the Subject, yet to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to the Perſons, with whom we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. We ought not to conteſt a Point with Perſons of Honour, and thoſe that are much above us; it is a breach of the Deference and Reſpect due to their Character. Nor will it become us to do it with thoſe that are much below us, either in Quality, or in Parts; for neither of theſe are an equal Match for us; To the One we are reſtrained by Good Manners; and the Other is to Triumph, where we ought rather to be aſhamed of the Victory.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Fifth Rule is, To be Modeſtly Inquiſitive: For there is a decent and very commendable Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſuch as with great Innocence and Temper, and genteel Addreſs, endeavours to be informed of all things ſit to be known; and when a Man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this, his next care muſt be to manage his Knowledge to the beſt advantage, and make every thing turn to ſome account with him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The Sixth and moſt important Direction is, To make uſe of his Judgment upon all occaſions; for the examining and conſidering Matters well is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of a Man; 'Tis This, that acts, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and finiſhes All. Without the Underſtanding every thing is void of Senſe and Life, and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as if it were not. Thus in Hiſtory particularly, How poor a thing is it to remember the Paſſages we read? The judging of what is done is the Soul and Energy of Reading: But this perhaps you will think a little out of ſeaſon here; and ſo far I confeſs it is, that the acting this judicious part in Converſation,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53648:411"/>is what concerns a Man's ſelf, and not the Company he is engaged in.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The Seventh is, Never to talk poſitively, nor be peremptory in any thing: And above all things, to avoid that Magiſterial and Imperious Air, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Dictate to all the Company; That Stiffneſs and Opiniatrety, which is, of all things in the World, the moſt nauſeous and offenſive. An inſolent dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Humour is what no body can help being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at; and indeed it is uſually a ſign of a Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ignorant Fellow. The Style of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was ſo extremely modeſt, that even the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in their Depoſitions, and the Judges in their Sentences and Decrees, when they ſpoke nothing but from their own poſitive and certain Knowledge, did always ſoften their Expreſſions with an <hi>Ita videtur, To the beſt of my Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>This is my Judgment.</hi> And if theſe Perſons were ſo much upon their Guard in thoſe moſt Solemn Occaſions; what ought the Generality of People to be in Common Diſcourſe? Sure it were convenient, for a Man to accuſtom himſelf to all thoſe Expreſſions, that may any way ſweeten the harſhneſs, or take off from the raſhneſs of what we ſay; ſuch as, <hi>Poſſibly, As they ſay, In my Opinion, In ſome ſenſe;</hi> And ſo again, when we reply to others, to qualify our Anſwers thus, <hi>Sir, I do not apprehend you; what is the meaning of that? nay poſſibly it may be ſo, ſay you ſo?</hi> or the like. By all which we ſufficiently make our own Senſe underſtood, but convey it in a leſs ſhocking manner.</p>
                        <p>I will conclude this firſt general part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with this ſhort Admonition; That the true Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for converſing with the World, are<note n="*" place="bottom">Frons aperta, Lingua parca, Mens clau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Let us now proceed to the other Conſideration, and that part of Converſation which is Choſen and Particular.<note place="margin">Second part. Particular Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And here theſe following Hints may probably be of ſome uſe, for the due Government of our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt concerns the Choice of our Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; in which it ſhould be our great care, to find out Men of the beſt Senſe, and ſoundeſt Judgment; and to frequent the Company of ſuch. For by conferring with Wiſe and Judicious Perſons, the Mind whets and fortifies it ſelf; it improves every day, hath ſtronger and higher Notions of Things, and is elevated above its common pitch. As on the other hand, it degenerates and falls off, grows poor, and weak, and deſpicably low; by uſing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of People that are ſo: For Ill Qualities are catching as well as Diſeaſes; and the Mind is at leaſt as much, if not a great deal more, liable to Infection, than the Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> The Second is, Not to be Surprized, or much Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Opinions of other People; for how different ſoever they may be from our Own, or from Thoſe commonly entertained in the World; how odd and extravagant, how frivolous and abſurd ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may appear to Us, yet ſtill they are ſuited, it ſeems, to the Notions and Nature of a Human Mind; which, like a fertile Soil, is in a capacity of producing all manner of Seed; and therefore it is a Weakneſs in us to be amazed at a Crop, ſo very unlike what grows in our own part of this common Field.</p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:53648:412"/>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> The Third is, Not to be afraid of Correction, nor ſurprized or troubled for any rough Treatment, or ſharp expreſſions, which it ſhall fall to our Lot to receive. For Theſe are Things, that a Man ought by all means to harden himſelf againſt, and learn to bear them without being moved. Brave Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves boldly; they ſpeak and ſpare not; This nice and ceremonious Softneſs, this tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, ſo fearful to give the leaſt umbrage, is fit for none but Women, and formal Coxcombs: Men ought to Converſe like Men; their Familiarity ſhould be open and free, maſculine and generous, full of courage and becoming confidence; they ſhould dare, both to give and take Reproof, when occaſion requires. It is but a dull and inſipid Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to have always to do with ſuch ſupple and well-bred Fools, as Conſent, and Flatter, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud all you ſay, be it True or Falſe, Right or Wrong, Indifferently.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> The Fourth is, To make Truth our Conſtant Aim and End; to direct all Diſcourſes hither, to acknowledge it whereſoever we meet it, to yield to it fairly and chearfully; For This is a Mark of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, to make no difference or reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but give up our Aſſent to Truth, let it come from what hand it will; To be Honeſt and Sincere upon all occaſions, and in all our diſputes; and not like Pedantick Wretches, who affect to ſhew their Parts, maintain an Argument, right or wrong, and wrangle for Victory, and the laſt Word; and think it a Reproach to give out, and not Silence their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. The nobleſt Conqueſt, after all, is to conquer one's own Vanity; and the trueſt Glory, is to ſubmit to Reaſon; for This we are ſure is Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indeed; but an Adverſary may be baſtled by Art and Management; a Good Cauſe may ſuffer by a weak and unskilful Defence; This is not carrying a Point, but triumphing over an Infirmity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53648:412"/>all Heat, and Poſitiveneſs, and Paſſion, ſhould be avoided. When a Man confeſſes his Miſtake, owns his Scruples, or his Ignorance; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his Faults, when made ſenſible of them; when he can yield quietly and decently to ſtronger Reaſons; This Man ſhews more than common Marks of Judgment, and Candour, and Sincerity; which are indeed the principal Qualities of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Wiſdom; But Stiffneſs and Obſtinacy is an irrefragable Evidence of an ill Mind; and a ſure ſign of great, and many Vices and Defects.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Fifthly. When we engage in any Diſpute, it will be very adviſable, not to trouble one's ſelf with muſtering up all the Arguments that can any way be ſerviceable to us; but rather out of that Variety to cull out a few of the beſt, moſt pertinent, and ſuch as come up to our purpoſe; and to put Theſe into as cloſe and ſhort a method, as conveniently we can. For let a Man talk never ſo well, yet he may ſay too much; and the beſt Subjects may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tedious. And indeed, this Affected way of Enlargement, and Spinning out our Diſcourſes; our Repetitions and formal Amplifications, are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of a Man's Oſtentation, and Vanity, and loving to hear himſelf Talk; and as ſuch, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too, to be troubleſome and offenſive, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails to tire, and to prejudice the Company againſt us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> The Sixth, and indeed the Chief, Direction is, To obſerve due Form and Order, and not to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Digreſſions and Excurſions in our Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Oh the horrid Confuſion, and Vexation, that there is in diſputing or talking, with an impertinent Coxcomb; that ventures at All, knows nothing of the Matter, will be kept to no Method, but is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally out of Time! This ſeems the only reaſonable excuſe for breaking abruptly, and renouncing all Meaſures; nay, for leaving the Field, and giving
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53648:413"/>quite out. For, what can you expect but Teazing and Torment, from a Fellow, that is Untractable, and Incorrigible? Not to diſcern the Strength of what you offer againſt him, to take his own courſe, to run away with his own Notions, and never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Objections of an Adverſary; to hang upon ſome one word; to catch hold upon a thing accidental and by the by; and let go the principal and deſigned Argument of Diſcourſe; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and jumble all; ſuſpect every word; deny every thing at a venture; to proceed in no order; to weary you with formal Prefaces, and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Digreſſions; and after a world of words, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, to grow Loud and Clamorous; to ſtick to his own Senſe, and not to be one whit moved by all one can ſay; to inſiſt upon Forms and Terms of Art; and never come to the true head of an Argument, nor know the real Merits of the Cauſe; Theſe are the Qualities, and common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Pedants and Sophiſters, Arrogant and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Coxcombs. And from this Deſcription we may very eaſily learn, how to diſtinguiſh between judicious and pertinent Wiſdom, and prating Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence and Folly. This is Bold and Raſh, Hot and Fierce, Arrogant and Aſſured; the Former is never Confident or Poſitive; but Cautious and Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Modeſt and Referved; Calm and Peaceable. The Wiſe Man is full of Reſpect, and free in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Allowances; obtains his Victory fairly, and uſes it generouſly; but the Impertinent is full of Self-ſatisfaction and Joy; leaves the field with an air of Gaiety and Boaſting; as taking for granted that the Day is his own; all his Countenance and Behaviour is triumphant, and proclaims to the Company, that he looks upon himſelf as abſolute Conqueror.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Laſtly. When we are reduced to a neceſſity of contradicting any thing ſaid; particular care ſhould
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53648:413"/>be taken, that we do it not after a bold and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming manner; nor betray any thing that looks like Eagerneſs and a Spirit of Contention. For, if it have any of theſe ill Symptoms, it can never be well received; and the Miſchief will be much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Author himſelf, than to the Perſon whom it is directed againſt. The only way to render any oppoſition tolerably eaſy to the Company, and to be ſecure from any of thoſe ill Reſentments, which are apt to follow upon it, is to contrive, that it ſhould be produced upon the ſpot, and immediately applied to the Matter, which gave the Provocation; that it be not far fetched, not foreign to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcourſe, nor ripping up ſomewhat long paſt and forgotten. It muſt alſo be levelled at the Thing alone, and be free from any Perſonal Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; nor muſt we contradict any thing becauſe ſuch a one ſays it, but merely becauſe the Thing it ſelf deſerves, and the vindication of Innocence or Truth requires it. In which caſe, if there be any manner of occaſion put into our hands, it is a very proper expedient, to ſoften the difference of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with ſome particular Commendation of the Perſon we oppoſe; But above all things, we muſt be ſure that in all matters of this Nature, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Temper; and Reaſon with all the Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and calm Argument; the gentleſt Terms, and moſt inoffenſive Language, that is poſſible.</p>

                        <p>THIS Particular does in ſtrictneſs belong to the Virtue of Prudence; of which our intended Method hath not as yet led us to treat, but reſerved that to the following Book. And there indeed is the proper place, for inſiſting ſeverally upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rules and Admonitions, which anſwer to the ſeveral Kinds and Branches of Prudence; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againſt that infinite variety of Occurrences, which call for the exerciſe of it in Human Life. But in the mean while, I will ſo far enter into that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at preſent, as to lay down ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Points of Prudence, which may ſerve for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general Topicks; Thus to inſtruct my Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the Groſs, how to behave himſelf well and wiſely in the common Correſpondence and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the World; and to make him a Maſter of his Buſineſs. For the due Management whereof, I would recommend theſe Eight Directions that follow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Firſt of theſe is, That he would be ſure to get good Information,<note place="margin">Knowledge of Men and Things.</note> and a competent Knowledge of Men and Things. For the Men he hath to deal with, it is requiſite he be well acquainted with their particular Humour and Diſpoſition, their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Capacity, their Inclination, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Paſſions; their Intention and Deſign, and the Methods by which they move. The Things, or particular Buſineſs, in which a man is engaged, or which he propoſes to undertake, ought likewiſe to be well underſtood; Whereby I mean, not ſuch a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53648:414"/>ſlender and ſuperficial Knowledge, as conſiders the Appearances only, but a thorough Examination to the very bottom: Such a Diſquiſition, as does not only conſider the Things themſelves in their own Nature, but enlarges and extends it ſelf, to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which they in any probability may be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with, and the ſeveral Conſequences they are like to draw after them. Now, in order to attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Knowledge, it is neceſſary to take a cloſe and particular view of our Affairs; to turn them all manner of ways, eye them in all the different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they are capable of, and nicely ſcan all the Forms, and Circumſtances of them, which our own Imagination can repreſent them under. For there are a great many Attempts, which have a fair and beautiful ſide, full of Invitation and large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and yet if you turn the other ſide, look horrid and forbidding, and ſhew nothing but Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Danger. Now there is no occaſion to prove the Neceſſity of ſuch a Knowledge as This; becauſe it is ſo very evident, that This is the very Compaſs Men muſt ſteer by; For no Man doubts, but that the different Tempers of Men, and conditions of Things bring us under an abſolute Neceſſity of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our Meaſures, and making all our Scheme ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them. A Man in this caſe ſhould be as vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and as dextrous, as the Seamen are; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gibe their Sails, and ply their Oars diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; as the Wind ſhifts, or their Courſe they run, brings them upon different Roads and Shores. And as They could never make their Ports by ſteering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame Courſe, no more could a Man, who always governs himſelf alike in Buſineſs, expect any other effect at laſt, than that his Affairs ſhould be ruined and come to nothing, and that all the World ſhould deſpiſe and laugh at his Folly. Now, if we do but reflect a very little, how intricate the Affairs of the World are, and how much more intricate
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53648:415"/>and full of Diſguiſe Human Nature is; The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity will appear ſo great, as to convince us, that the Knowledge I have here been adviſing, is no ſuch eaſy matter; but that we muſt be content to come at it ſlowly and painfully; for it requires much At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, long Study, and repeated Conſideration; a Judgment clear and ſtrong, and a Mind unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced and free from Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The next Leſſon to be learnt upon this occaſion, is That of knowing how to make a juſt Eſtimate of Things,<note place="margin">Juſt Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cm.</note> ſo as to give each that real Value, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place in our Opinion, which of Right belongs to it. And this is a certain Effect of Prudence and Sufficiency. It is indeed a very high pitch of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, to be able to do this; and ſuch as a Man ſhall never riſe up to, except he firſt get clear of his own deceitful Paſſions, and the Common received Errors of the World. There are ſome ſix or ſeven Qualities, that ſtrangely captivate Vulgar Minds; and ſeduce them into very miſtaken Valuations of a Thing, which Wiſe Men will take good Care not to be deluded by. Theſe are, The Novelty, The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, The Strangeneſs, The Difficulty, The Artiſicial Compoſure, The Quaintneſs of the Invention, The Abſence or preſent Want, The loſing or being refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; it; but eſpecially, and above all the reſt, the Noiſe, and Show, and Pomp it creates in the World. Thus the generality of People look upon all things to be little better than deſpicable, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by Art, and Study, and Human Skill; they muſt have them raiſed and reſined, to recommend them. Thoſe that are plain and ſimple, and have nothing but their own Native Excellencies to ſet them off, (let thoſe Excellencies in reality be never ſo valuable) are ſo far from being had in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that they are ſcarce taken notice of at all. They paſs off in the common Crowd, unobſerv'd and unſeen; or, if they are ſeen, yet do they not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53648:415"/>move us, but are look'd upon as low, flat, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid: Than which we cannot have a plainer Proof of the Vanity and Weakneſs of Mankind, who thus take up with Air and Emptineſs, and are content to accept Baſe Metal, and Counterfeit Coin in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather than True Standard and Current Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Hence it is, that Art is ſo much preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nature; Acquired Excellencies to Thoſe that are Innate; Things difficult and elaborate, before Thoſe that are eaſy; ſudden Guſhes, and Flights, and impetuous Sallies, before the Conſtancy and Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Habit and Temper; Things extraordinary, above Thoſe that are ordinary and uſual; Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pomp, above intrinſick and private real Worth; Things that are Another's, above our Own; Foreign above Domeſtick, Borrowed before Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And how egregiouſly fooliſh now is all This? This, I ſay, is the Folly of the Vulgar and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning; but Wiſe Men obſerve other Meaſures. They take care not to be thus impoſed upon, nor carried away with fantaſtical Notions; but to paſs a ſevere and critical Enquiry; and judge of Things, firſt by their True, Subſtantial, and Natural Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which many times is internal, and lies far out of ſight; And then by the Advantages they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bringing. Theſe are ſolid Foundations of Eſteem, all the reſt is mere Cheat and Deluſion.</p>
                        <p>Now, it muſt be confeſs'd, the being able to make theſe Diſtinctions judiciouſly, is exceeding difficult; for the World is full of Sophiſtry and Diſguiſe; Things have a Thouſand Falſe Faces; and it often happens, that Thoſe which are really Counterfeit and worth nothing, look fairer, more gay, more inviting; than Thoſe that are truly valuable and good. (Nay, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath ventured to ſay, That in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Speculation, there are a great many Falſities, which carry more ſhew of Probability, and bid fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at firſt ſight for engaging our Aſſent, than ſeveral
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53648:416"/>Truths do:) But then, for our Encouragement, we ought to remember, that as This is a very difficult and laborious, ſo is it likewiſe an incomparably No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt Divine Attainment; and withal, that it is of infinite Uſe, and Abſolute Neceſſity.<note n="*" place="bottom">Quàm neceſſarium pretia rebus imponere?</note> 
                           <hi>How neceſſary is it</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>to ſet a true rate upon things?</hi> And ſo without queſtion it muſt needs be. For, to what purpoſe does a Man inform himſelf in the Rules and Directions for living well, till he be firſt rightly inſtructed, what account he ought to hold thoſe ſeveral Objects in, which his Deſires and Actions are converſant about? Riches, for inſtance, and Health, and Beauty, and Quality, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what degrees of Good theſe can pretend to, and what Evil he is to expect, or can ſuffer from their Contraries. It is a great Inſtance of Skill in Moral Heraldry, to know the Places of all theſe, and what Precedences are due to them reſpectively; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when ſeveral of them meet together, it is not eaſy to proportion our Reſpects, becauſe the Number confounds us; and indeed all People are not, nor ever will be agreed as to their Quality, which of them is moſt honourable. The Taſtes and Judgments of particular Perſons differ exceedingly; And it is very well they do, for if all Mankind were fond of the ſame thing, they would conſtantly be interfering, and hindring one another.</p>
                        <p>For an Inſtance of what I have ſaid; let us take theſe Eight Principal Sources of all the Happineſs, we can propoſe to our ſelves in this World; whether of Body or Mind. I ſhall pair them together by mentioning Four of each ſort; And they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity and Health; Wiſdom and Beauty; Good Parts and Quality; Learning and Riches. Theſe Terms I underſtand here in the common and received
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53648:416"/>Senſe, and do not confine them to a Philoſophical Nicety. By Wiſdom I mean a Prudence and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Government of our Selves, and in all our converſation and Deportment with Others: By Good Parts, that Capacity, and thoſe Abilities for Buſineſs, which ſuch Perſons are known to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and provided with, above others, to whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been leſs bountiful. And by Learning, that Knowledge of Things, which is acquired by Books and Study. The Reſt are ſo perſpicuous, that they need no Explanation.</p>
                        <p>Now what a prodigious Difference do we find in the Opinions of Men, in adjuſting the Place and Precedence, which is pretended to belong to theſe Eight Things? What infinite and irreconcilable Competitions are there among them? I, for my own part, have delivered my own Judgment freely already in this Treatiſe; I have here mingled them together, and tacked them to one another in ſuch order, that each Advantage of the Mind hath one belonging to the Body, joined; and ſo joined as to be correſpondent, to it; for as Nature hath united Body and Soul together, ſo ſhe ſeems to have given each of them Accompliſhments extremely agreeable, and alike. Thus Health is to the Body, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity is to the Mind; it is the Probity or good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Body, as Probity is the Health of the Soul. Theſe ſhould be the Sum of our Wiſhes.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53648:417"/>of the Body; and Wiſdom is the Regularity, the Decency, the Beauty of the Soul. Quality and Good Birth is a wonderful Capacity, a mighty Diſpoſition to Virtue; and theſe Spiritual Abilities again, and Good Parts, are the Nobility of the Mind. Learning is the Wealth of the Soul, and Riches the acquired Advantage of the Body. Others, I know, will differ from me in the Method and Order of ranging theſe Qualifications; for ſome put all the Advantages of the Mind firſt; and are of opinion, that the leaſt of Theſe is more valuable, than the beſt and higheſt of Thoſe that belong to the Body; and others, who go not ſo far, yet may not agree in the Preference due to each Particular. Every Man in this Caſe follows his own Senſe, and from that we cannot but expect great Variety of Judgments will enſue.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In the next place, ſucceeds a Third Qualification, which indeed naturally ſprings out of the former; For,<note place="margin">Wiſe Choice.</note> from the Sufficiency of paſſing a juſt Eſtimate upon things, is derived an Ability of making a Wiſe Choice; and this is, not only a matter of Duty and Conſcience, but very often an Eminent Inſtance of Wiſdom and good Conduct. There are indeed ſome Caſes extremely plain and eaſy; as when Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and Vice, Honeſty and Profit, Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſtand in competition; For the Preeminence in this Compariſon is ſo viſible and ſo vaſt, on one ſide above the other, that whenever theſe things encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter each other, the Advantage lies, and the Balance ſhould always fall, to the ſide of Duty, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with never ſo great Difficulty and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. In the Caſe of Private Perſons, I mean, for poſſibly there may ſometimes be room for an Exception; but then this does not often happen, and if it do, 'tis generally in the Adminiſtration of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs; and then too, it muſt be managed with great Tenderneſs and Circumſpection. But of This
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53648:417"/>I ſhall have a more proper ſeaſon to ſpeak, when my Third Book brings us to treat of Prudence in particular. But ſometimes there is ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Circumſtances, that a Man is driven to a very hard Choice: As for Inſtance, When we ſtand inclos'd, as it were, with Two Vices, and there is no getting clear of both. Thus Hiſtory deſcribes that Eminent Father <hi>Origen,</hi> who had it left to him, Whether he would commit Idolatry, or ſuffer his Body to be carnally abuſed by a <hi>Moor:</hi> The firſt was the Thing he choſe, and ſome ſay he choſe amiſs. Now, when we are unhappily involved in ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and at a loſs which way we ſhould incline, in the choice of Matters not morally evil; the beſt Rule we can be guided by, is to go over to that ſide, where there is the greateſt Appearance of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Honeſty. For, though every thing ſhould not afterwards ſucceed according to our Wiſh or Expectation, yet there will reſult ſo pleaſing an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſuch Glory, and Self-gratulations from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for our having taken the better Part, as will make us ample Compenſation for our Misfortunes, and abundantly ſupport us under them: And beſides all this, If the Worſe, but ſeemingly Safer Side, had been choſen, what Security can we have, that the Event would have proved more favourable? and why may we not reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Governour and Lord of Us, and all our Fortunes, would have been provoked to puniſh, and diſappoint us that way too? When Matters ſeem to be ſo equal, that we cannot diſtinguiſh, which is the better, and ſhorter courſe, we ſhould take that which is the plaineſt and ſtraighteſt. And in Things manifeſtly Immoral (of which properly ſpeaking there cannot be any Choice) we muſt avoid that which is moſt deteſtable, and hath more of Villany and Horror in it. For this indeed is a Point of Conſcience, and is more truly a part of Probity than of Prudence. But it is very
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53648:418"/>often exceeding hard to ſatisfy one's ſelf, which of Two things of the ſame kind is the more agreeable to Juſtice, or to Decency, or which is preferable in point of Advantage: And ſo likewiſe of Two Ill Things, which is the more Unjuſt, more Indecent and Diſhoneſt, or attended with worſe Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Upon the whole matter then, though the Act of chuſing is an Act of Probity and Conſcience; yet the Ability of making this Choice aright is a part of Prudence and ſound Judgment. I am apt to believe, that in ſuch Straights as theſe, the beſt and ſafeſt way will be to follow Nature; and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that thoſe Things which are moſt agreeable to Nature, are the more juſt and becoming; and that what is moſt diſtant from, or contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is more eſpecially to be avoided and abhorred by us. This agrees well with what was formerly delivered in our deſcription of Probity, That we ought to be Good Men, by the Dictates and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of Nature.</p>
                        <p>Before I go off from this Point of Choice, give me leave to ſay one word or two for the reſolving a Doubt, which ſome People have ſtarted, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Determination of our Wills in theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Queſtion is, When Two Things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo Equal and Indifferent, that we can give no reaſon, why One ſhould be valued more than the Other; what it is that diſpoſes the Soul to take the One, and leave the Other? The <hi>Stoicks</hi> pretend, that it is a raſh Operation of the Soul, ſomewhat Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and Extraordinary, and beſide its proper courſe. But let Them ſay what they will, We may be bold to affirm, That there is no g round for the Queſtion; and that no Two Things ever do, or can preſent themſelves to our Conſideration, ſo as to be perfectly Equal and Indifferent to us: It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens indeed, that the Difference is very ſmall and inconſiderable; but ſtill ſome difference
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53648:418"/>there is; ſomething we apprehend in One, and not in the Other, which caſts the Scale, and draws us on to a Choice; though the Motion be ſo gentle, that we ſcarce feel it; and the Motive ſo ſlender, that we know not how to expreſs, and can very hardly give our ſelves any account of it. But ſtill certain it is, that were a Man evenly poized between Two Deſires, he would never chuſe at all: For all Choice implies Inclination of the Mind, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination ſuppoſes Inequality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Another very neceſſary Direction in this Matter, is, That of conſulting with our Friends,<note place="margin">Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and taking good Advice. For there is great danger in acting upon our own heads, and depending entirely upon our ſelves; Others will ſee further, and judge better of our Affairs, than Partiality and Concern will ſuffer Us to do. Now in this Point of Conſulting, there are Two Cautions very neceſſary to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the prudent management of our ſelves, and the making this method turn to account with us.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt regards the Choice of fit Perſons to Adviſe with: For Many are much better let along than applied to, and a Man is as highly concerned to be upon his Guard, and conceal his Deſigns from Some ſort of People, as he is to communicate them, and addreſs for Counſel to Others. Thoſe then, who are proper for ſuch purpoſes, muſt Firſt of all be Men of Integrity and Fidelity, that is, fit to be truſted; and then they muſt be Men of ſound Senſe, Sober and Diſcreet, Wiſe and Experienced; otherwiſe they will not be fit to Direct. Honeſty and Sufficiency are the Two Indiſpenſable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good Counſellers; and indeed, to Theſe we may add a Third Conſideration which ought to weigh with us very much in our Choice; and This is, That neither They themſelves, nor any of their Relations, or particular Friends, be at all concerned in the matter we conſult about. For, though you
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53648:419"/>may poſſibly Reply to this, That I have ſufficiently prevented any Miſchiefs of that kind, by providing already, that they ſhould be Perſons of Integrity, and whoever is ſo, will not be biaſſed by his own, or his Friend's Intereſt; yet to that I muſt rejoin, in juſtification of this Advice; Firſt, That Honeſty ſo ſtanch, and firm, and Philoſophical, as ſhall be Proof againſt all the Impreſſions of Advantage, is to be met with in very few. It is indeed what ought to be; but as the World goes, it is rather to be wiſh'd for, than found and practiſed. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Allowing the Party we Conſult, to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Perfection of unmovable Sincerity; yet it is neither Wiſdom, nor Kindneſs, nor good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to drive him to ſuch Difficulties, and ſuch Anxieties of heart, as the asking his Advice in ſuch Circumſtances muſt needs involve him in. This is what we call putting him in between the Milſtones, where he muſt either cruſh himſelf, or us.</p>
                        <p>The other part of Caution, requiſite upon theſe occaſions, regards the receiving Advice, when our Counſellers are choſen. And this muſt be ſure to have a patient Hearing, and kind and gratefull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment allowed it; we ſhould follow and put it in practice betimes, and not delay, till we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Extremities; we ſhould conſider and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon it with Judgment and Candour, and be well pleaſed that our Friends ſhould ſpeak their Minds freely, and declare the Truth, though it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ſevere and unpalatable to us. When we have taken our Meaſures according to it, in full conſidence of the Prudence and Friendſhip with which it was given, we muſt not afterwards repine, or be ſorry that we have been guided by it, though the Event fall ſhort, or prove contrary to our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. For it is a very common thing for good Counſel to be very unſucceſsful. But a Wiſe Man ought to take greater Satisfaction in proper Meaſures,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53648:419"/>and prudent Conduct, though the Conſequence be calamitous; than in the greateſt good fortune ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, when his Meaſures were falſe and ill-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted; When as the Hiſtorian obſerves of <hi>Marius;</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">Sic correcta Marij temeritas gloriam ex culpâ invenit.</note> 
                           <hi>The Raſhneſs of the General was corrected by the Event, and his fault received Honour and Commendation.</hi> It is below a Man of Senſe, and agreeable to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Vulgar and Ignorant Souls only, to ſit down and wiſh they had done otherwiſe; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the matureſt Deliberation, and the beſt choice their caſe will admit, to fancy they took a wrong Courſe: For ſuch People in their Croſſes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, only weigh the Reaſons for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Methods, without having Greatneſs or Preſence of Mind to counterbalance Theſe, with Thoſe other, once more forcible Arguments, which induced them to act as they did. Thus much was not amiſs, I thought, to be hinted briefly for the uſe of thoſe who want, and ask Advice; but as for the Perſons addreſs'd to, the Rules fit to be obſerv'd by Them in giving of it, ſhall be ſpecified at large under the Head of Prudence. For indeed Counſel is a very conſiderable and extenſive Branch of that Virtue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Fifth Thing, which I apprehend adviſable for the prudent Management of Affairs,<note place="margin">Moderation between Fear and Aſſurance.</note> is a Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper; conſiſting in a middle ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Extremes of Confidence and Diſtruſt; Aſſurance and Fearfulneſs. And this is neceſſary to be well Moderated, both with regard to our Selves, and Others.</p>
                        <p>To repoſe too great Confidence in a Friend, and reckon our ſelves abſolutely ſure of him, is very often Prejudicial to our Affairs; and to diſtruſt his Ability, or his Inclination to do us Service, is offenſive to Him; Inſomuch, that where we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53648:420"/>Suſpicious, though never ſo juſt in themſelves, yet it is not prudent to give any Demonſtrations of our Jealouſy. For no Man loves to be Diſtruſted, (becauſe every Man loves to be thought to have Power and Sincerity) and therefore to betray our Diſtruſt is ſure to Diſpleaſe; nay, likely to Provoke, and turn a Friend into an Enemy. But then, on the other hand we muſt be careful too, not to be ſo entirely depending, ſo lazy and ſecure in our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, as not to be very much upon our Guard, except it be with ſome very choice and tried Friends: A Man never Rides ſafe without the Reins in his own Hand; only, the Skill of the Horſeman muſt be ſhown, in neither letting them hang too ſlack, nor drawing them too ſtiff. A Man ſhould never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe all his Thoughts, and Intentions; but, ſo far as he thinks convenient to communicate his Mind, he ſhould do it with Truth and Sincerity; he muſt by no means Deceive or Enſnare his Friend, and therefore let him tell True; but he muſt take heed too, that he be not Deceived or Abuſed Himſelf, and therefore he ſhould take care not to tell All. He ſhould follow that excellent Advice of our Bleſſed Maſter; to Marry the Serpent with the Dove; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering and qualifying that Innocence and Simplicity which reſtrains a Man from hurting Others, with that Wiſdom and Subtlety, which keeps him from injuring Himſelf; ſo ſtanding upon one's Guard, and Defending one's Self againſt the Cunning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, and Treacherous Deſigns, and unſeen Ambuſhments of our pretending Friends. For Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and Stratagem is as commendable a Weapon, when uſed Defenſively, as it is Diſhonourable and Baſe, when Offenſive. And therefore every Motion ſhould be wary and well-adviſed; and in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of Familiarity and Confidence, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver engage ſo far, as not to ſecure a Retreat to our Selves, whenever our Inclination ſhall diſpoſe, or
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53648:420"/>the Neceſſity of our Affairs oblige us to it: Nay not only ſo, It is not enough, that our Retreat be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it muſt be ſafe and eaſy, without any great Reluctancy in our Selves, or any Damage from Thoſe, in whom we Conſided.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we ſhould not ſo far be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of our Selves, as to let this grow into Security and Preſumption. If we have Friends, though they do not bear our whole Weight, yet it is not convenient to let go our Hold; nor for any Opinion, either of our own Abilities, or the proſperous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Affairs, to diſdain Another's Help, or grow negligent and remiſs in our Own Care. And yet this is oftentimes the Caſe of Men, who think no body ſo Wiſe as themſelves, or have that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own Power and Addreſs, to imagine every thing will bow before, and truckle under them; that no body will dare to attempt any thing to their Prejudice or diſſatisfaction; and from Theſe fond Poſſeſſions, come to abate of their Pains, to deſpiſe all Care; and ſo at laſt are abominably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached, ſurprized into Miſchief and Ruin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Jeſt and publick Scorn.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Another, and That indeed a very important piece of Advice, is,<note place="margin">Tge katubg gikd ib Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</note> To take every thing in its proper Time, while it is ſeaſonable, and Occaſion ſerves. And in order hereunto, we muſt be ſure to avoid Precipitation, which is a mortal Enemy to Wiſdom, the bane and confounder of all good Deſigns: And a Vice very uſual, and much to be ſeared, among People in heat of Youth, and all others of a warm and ſanguine Complexion. And in truth, the knowing how to take every thing in the Nick; to lay hold on every Opportunity and Advantage, and make the beſt of all times, and all means of Action, is one of the maſterly Perfections of a Wiſe and Dextrous Manager. For we are to conſider, that every thing hath its Seaſon, and even the beſt things,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53648:421"/>as we may order them, may be irregular, and out of due Time. Now Haſt and Hurry is the moſt contrary to that good Quality, that can poſſibly be imagined; for This diſorders, and confounds All; and ſo at laſt ſpoils All. You know the common Proverb,<note n="*" place="bottom">Canis feſtinans caecos parit catulos.</note> 
                           <hi>Haſty Bitches bring blind Whelps.</hi> This Precipitation is uſually the Effect of ſome Paſſion, which ſpurs us on too faſt, and will not endure to wait till Matters are ripe for Execution;<note n="†" place="bottom">Nam qui cupit, feſtinat; qui feſtinat evertit; unde feſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio improvida &amp; caeca; duo adverſiſſima rectae menti Celeritas &amp; Ira.</note> 
                           <hi>The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of deſire puts us upon haſtening, and Haſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and undoes all; ſo that This is always improvident and blind; Haſtineſs and Anger are the Two things in the World moſt diſtant from a Sober and Judicious Mind.</hi> Such is the account generally to be given of it; though it cannot be denied, but theſe Haſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are frequently owing to Weakneſs, and want of Judgment. Now the contrary Vice of Heavineſs, and Sloth, and Negligence in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which is ſometimes miſtaken for Solidity, and Thought, and wiſe Caution, is no leſs dangerous, and deſtructive to our Affairs, eſpecially then, when all Preliminaries are adjuſted, all Reſolutions taken, and nothing remains but the Executive part. For it is well obſerved, That in Deliberation and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation a Man is allowed to ſpend a great deal of Time, becauſe then every Particular is to be nicely weighed, every Advice canvaſſed, and out of All compared together, the Beſt to be pitched upon; but when we come to Action, the caſe is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the Mind is then ſuppoſed to be ſettled, and all Doubt over; upon which account it is, that we are commanded by the Maſters of Wiſdom, to to be Slow in Counſel, and Swift in Execution; to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53648:421"/>deliberate at leiſure, but to ſiniſh apace. It is true indeed, this Rule is not ſo univerſally efficacious, but that ſometimes we ſee Events contrary to it. A Man ſtumbles upon Succeſs, though he run headlong upon it; and proves as Fortunate in the Event, though the Time he took to conſider, was very ſhort; and the Reſolves he made, as raſh and imprudent, as they were haſty; But this is very ſeldome ſeen; and the few Inſtances we have of it are owing purely to Chance; And Chance is ſomewhat ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the ordinary courſe of Affairs, that a Man can never depend upon it, or govern himſelf by ſuch Events. On the contrary, He ſhould take great care, That theſe lucky Hits, like a winning hand, do not tempt us to run too great a Riſque, and venture upon them boldly. For, commonly ſpeaking, Gameſters give out Loſers; and all they have to ſhew for their daring Haſtineſs, is only That Proverb, <hi>Of Reſolving in Haſt, and Repenting at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> Ruin and a fruitleſs Remorſe being commonly the End of ſuch inconſiderate Undertakings.</p>
                        <p>Theſe then are the Two Extremes, which like Rocks muſt be avoided, and with equal care too; for if we Split upon Either, our Affairs will be ſhipwrack'd and loſt. It is as great a Fault to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate a fair occaſion, and ſnatch it, while it is Green and Crude; as it would be to let it Wither and Rot in our Hands. The Former is a Defect moſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Young Men; whoſe Spirits move briskly, and their Blood boils in their Veins; and whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are ſo eager and impetuous, that they want Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and cannot be content to let Time and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence bring things to Maturity, and work for them; and ſo theſe ſprightly Men, by ſtarting too quick, run, and catch nothing; The Latter is more proper to Stupid Men, the Cowardly and Irreſolute; the Lazy and Unactive. For there is need of a Sprightly and Vigilant Soul to diſcern and to lay
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53648:422"/>hold on favourable Junctures; but then at the ſame time that the Soul muſt be awake, we muſt ſee, that it be not Reſtleſs and Impatient. A Man muſt look before him; deſcry Opportunities at a diſtance; keep his Eye conſtantly upon them; obſerve all the motions they make towards him; make himſelf ready for their approach; and, lying thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the catch, when he ſees his time, lay faſt hold, and not let go again, till he hath done his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Seventh Direction I would give at preſent, <note place="margin">Induſtry and Fortune.</note> is for a Man to govern himſelf well, and do his Duty to the Two great Diſpoſers, and Superintendants of all Human Affairs; Induſtry I mean, or which in this place comes to the ſame thing, Virtue, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. It hath long been matter of Controverſy, which of Theſe carries the greateſt Sway; and the Queſtion never was or will be decided to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all People; for ſome have a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for One, and ſome for the Other. Thus much at leaſt is paſt all doubt; that both the One and the Other do a great deal; both have Power and Credit; and both have a Title indiſputable to ſhew for it; for nothing can be more palpably falſe, than that either of theſe Two does All, and the other Nothing. Perhaps indeed Matters would go better, if it were not thus; and Men have reaſon to wiſh, That the whole Authority were veſted in one of them ſingly. For then we ſhould know what to truſt to. Then our Task would be eaſy, becauſe all our Thought and Diligence would be fixed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to one Object; whereas now we float be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, the Diſtraction of the Mind renders our Attempts infinitely laborious and full of hazard; and we can very hardly attend to both, and bring them friendly to conſpire together. Daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proves this Truth to us; for uſually thoſe who are very much taken up with the One, diſregard
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53648:422"/>and perfectly deſpiſe the Other. Thus the Young and Sanguine, the Forward and Daring Men keep Fortune in their Eye, and lay the main ſtreſs there, as you ſee plainly by their large Hopes, and the mighty Succeſſes they promiſe themſelves in every Undertaking: And Fortune often rewards this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they pay her, and declares them her Favourites, by the many Prodigious and moſt Surprizing things wrought by them. On the Other hand, Men in Years, whoſe Blood is cold and heavy, and They conſequently calm and ſlow, place all their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Induſtry: And it cannot be denied, but Theſe act the more reaſonably of the Two. If a Man were diſpoſed to compare them both together, and obſerve what can be alledg'd to determine his Choice on either ſide; we may ſtate the Matter very fairly Thus. He that depends upon Induſtry, takes the Safeſt Side, the more Virtuous, and the more Reputable: For admit, that Fortune run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſpightfully defeat all his Diligence; yet is there ſtill this Satisfaction left, that he hath made no falſe Steps, that he ſuffered in his proper Poſt, doing his Duty; and that he hath acquitted himſelf, as became a Wife and an Honeſt Man. Thoſe that take the other courſe, are in great danger of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hoping in vain: But if all ſhould ſucceed to their hearts deſire, yet ſtill this is none of Their doing; nor is there really any Credit or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation due to them for it. But indeed, Wiſdom takes a middle Courſe; ſhe adviſes no Man entirely to devote himſelf to either of theſe; and though One may be preferred, yet not to that degree, as to bring the Other into abſolute Neglect and Contempt. For ſince Neither can be excluded from our Affairs, it is fit we ſhould allow Both a place in our Regard; and indeed they are often beholding to one another; and an obſerving Man will eaſily diſcern a great deal of Mutual Aſſiſtance, and a very good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53648:423"/>between them. We muſt take care then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our part to Both, but Both do not challenge our Reſpects alike. For the Preference is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſide of Induſtry; for according to that old Motto,<note n="*" place="bottom">Virtute duce, comite Fortunà.</note> 
                           <hi>Virtue ſhould lead, and Fortune go along with us.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> There is yet one neceſſary Caution behind, which is, In all our Behaviour to act with Diſcretion. For This ſeaſons every Action, and gives it an agreeable Reliſh. Now Diſcretion is not any One Particular Quality, but a Large and Comprehenſive Virtue; that mingles with every part of our Duty. Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſpoils all; and the very beſt Actions, if taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, loſe all their Beauty, and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If a Man deſign an Act of Beneficence or Charity, This is neceſſary to direct it; for neither all Kindneſſes are fit to be done; nor all ſorts of Perſons fit to receive them. If a Man would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or excuſe himſelf, he muſt do it diſcreetly; for there are ſome ways of Apologizing, which in effect are Bills of Indictment againſt one's Self; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Suſpicion, inſtead of clearing our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. If a Man would pay Civilities, and appear courteous and well-bred; he muſt diſtinguiſh and moderate himſelf here too; otherwiſe he will run into the Exceſs of Foppery and Affectation; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Clowniſh Rudeneſs; and the ſame may be ſaid of Offering, or Accepting, or any other Inſtance of Courteſy and Converſation; or indeed of Virtue in general; for without this Prudence, and diſcreet Managery, even Virtue, and the beſt Intentions, can never recommend, nay, can ſcarce juſtify themſelves to the Spectators.</p>

In order to make a true Judgment of Life, we muſt of neceſſity inform our ſelves what ſort of Concluſion it hath; For the End compleats and crowns the Work; and as a Good Death is an Honour to our whole Life, ſo an Ill one caſts back Infamy, and ſullies all that went before. You can never give a Juſt Character of the Player, till his Part be at End; and the Caſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Life is ſo far the ſame, that the Management of the Laſt Act is incomparably the moſt difficult of any, that belongs to either of them. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> one of the Braveſt Men that ever <hi>Greece</hi> bred, when his Opinion was asked, To which of the Three, he thought the Preference due, <hi>Chabrias, Iphicrates,</hi> or Himſelf; made anſwer, That this was a Queſtion incapable of being reſolved; For (ſays he) the Man that would determine juſtly of ſuch a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition

                        <p>'Tis without all diſpute a moſt Excellent Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53648:424"/>to have learnt how to dye: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is the Study of true Wiſdom, and that in which all its Rules,<note place="margin">Of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to dye.</note> and all its Labours determine: He that hath laid out his whole Life upon it, hath put it to no ill uſe; and He, who among all the reſt of his Qualifications is not Maſter of This, hath thrown away all his Time and Pains to no manner of purpoſe. <hi>That Man can never Live well, who knows not how to Dye well; and he hath lived to very good purpoſe, who makes a happy End,</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi>) A Man can no more govern and direct his Actions as he ought, who does not keep Death in his Eye; than an Archer can ſhoot well, who never looks at the Mark. In one word, The Art of Dying as becomes us, is the Art of Liberty, and an Eaſy Mind; the way to get above all Fear, and to live in perfect Happineſs and Tranquility; Without this there is no Pleaſure in Life; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible indeed there ſhould; for who can enjoy That with Peace and Satisfaction, which he eſteems moſt valuable and dear, and is tormented with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual anxious Fear of loſing every Moment?</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now the Firſt and Principal Step toward this, is to make it our Care and conſtant Endeavour, that our Vices may dye before us; and then our next Care muſt be, to live in conſtant Readineſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of dying our ſelves. Who can expreſs the happy Condition of that Man, who hath husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Talent, and finiſhed the Buſineſs of Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death approach to interrupt him? So that when he comes to dye, he hath nothing elſe to do but to dye; no occaſion to ask longer time; no farther Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for this Body; no need of any thing; but can walk out of the World, pleaſed and ſatisfied, like a Gueſt after a full Meal: All this I take to be comprehended in the Notion of our being always in a Readineſs for Death: There remains yet One Qualification more to be attained, which is the being Willing, as well as Ready; for no Man dies well,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53648:425"/>who goes out of the World with ſuch Loathneſs and Reluctancy, that it is mere matter of Conſtraint; and plain, he would fain, but cannot, ſtay here any longer.</p>

<list>
                              <item>1. They may Fear and Avoid it, as the Laſt and greateſt Evil.</item>
                              <item>2. They may expect and wait for it with great Eaſineſs, and Patience, and Reſignation of Mind, as for a Thing which they look upon as Natural, Unavoidable, and not only Neceſſary, but alſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to be undergone.</item>
                              <item>3. They may deſpiſe it, as a Matter Indifferent, and of no great Concern to them.</item>
                              <item>4. They may wiſh for it, pray for it, make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, as the only Safe Harbour which can give them Reſt and Protection from the Troubles of This Life; nay, as that which will not only be a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, but a Happineſs; a mighty Advantage, as well as a perfect Security.</item>
                              <item>5. They may bring it upon Themſelves.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, if we examine theſe Particulars, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Third, and Fourth will appear Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Good; the Thoughts and Reſentments of a Virtuous and a Judicious Mind; though it muſt be allowed, that as they differ from each other, ſo they are expected to move and affect the Man diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, according to his preſent Circumſtances. For All of them are not commendable equally, and at all times. But for the Firſt and Laſt, they never are or can be ſo at all; as being the Vicious Extremes of Weakneſs and Want of Virtue; for how different ſoever the Effects may appear, This is the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe of them both. I ſhall enlarge a little,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53648:425"/>and try to illuſtrate each of theſe Particulars, in this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Firſt is what no underſtanding Perſon hath ever pretended to approve, <note place="margin">Fear of Death.</note> though indeed it be the Practice (the Failing I ought to ſay,) of almoſt all the World. And what can be a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? what a more undeniable Evidence of the Weakneſs of Mankind, than that Every body in a manner ſhould be guilty of That, which No body dares undertake to defend? But on the contrary, againſt Thoſe, who labour under this painful Folly, in Tenderneſs for Themſelves; or are thus concerned upon the account of Others, we can never want Plenty of Arguments. Among others, Theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations may perhaps do ſomething toward ſoftning the Approach of our own Death, or that of our Friends to us.<note place="margin">The effect of vain O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> There is not in the World any Calamity, which Mortals have ſuch ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Notions, and live in ſuch conſtant Terror of, as Death; and yet it is very evident, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they call a Misfortune, dreaded upon ſuch Poor, ſuch Inſignificant Grounds; nay, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thoſe words, <hi>Dreading</hi> and <hi>Misfortune</hi> too; and dare venture to affirm, there is not any thing which ought to be received with greater Satisfaction, and a more reſolved Mind. So that we muſt be forced to confeſs, in deſpight of all the Sophiſtry of Fleſh and Blood to the contrary, that This is a mere Vulgar Error; Opinion hath charm'd and captivated all the World; for Reaſon hath no hand at all in it. We take it upon truſt from the Ignorant and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Multitude; and believe it a very great Evil, becauſe They tell us ſo; but when Wiſdom aſſures us, that it is a Deliverance and ſure Repoſe from all the Evils that can poſſibly befall us; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Haven where we can lye ſafely, after the Waves and Storms of a Troubleſome Toſſing World, we turn the deaf Ear, and believe not one word ſhe can
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53648:426"/>ſay. Thus much is certain: Death, when actually preſent, never did any body hurt; and none of thoſe many Millions, who have made the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and now know what it is, have made any Complaints of this nature concerning it. If then Death muſt be called an Evil, it hath this to ſay in its own Vindication; That of all the Evils which are, or ever were in the World, This is the only one that does no body harm; and in truth, the mighty Dread of it proceeds merely from ghaſtly and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Ideas, which Men's vain Imaginations form of it at a diſtance. There is nothing of Foundation or Reality at the bottom: 'tis all Opinion and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; nay, 'tis the very Inſtance, in which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion pretends moſt to ſet up againſt Reaſon; and attempts to fright us out of our Wits, by ſhewing the hideous Vizor of Death: For, Reaſon to fear it there can be none, becauſe we are ſo perfectly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what it is. How Unaccountable is our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, how almoſt Impoſſible indeed, for a Thing, of which we have little or no Notion? Upon which account, He, who had <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Teſtimony for the Wiſeſt Man living, ſaid, that To fear Death, was to pretend to be more knowing than one really was; and a vain Affectation of Wiſdom; for it was to make the World believe a Man underſtands a thing, which neither He, nor any body elſe underſtands: And we find, that this was his real Senſe, by the Teſtimony his Practice gave to it. For when his Friends importuned him to plead for his Life, and juſtify himſelf againſt the Calumnies of his Accuſers, the Addreſs he made upon that Occaſion, we are told, was to this Effect.<lb/>
                           <q>Gentlemen. If I ſhould make it my requeſt, That you would not put me to Death, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome apprehenſions of asking a Puniſhment, inſtead of a Favour; and ſuing to my own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. For I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, I do
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53648:426"/>not at all know what it is to Die; nor what Good or Ill is conſequent upon it. They who fear Death muſt in reaſon preſuppoſe ſome Notices of it, for my own part, I declare I have none; nor can I tell at all, either what ſort of Paſſage that is, which leads into the other World; or how Matters ſtand there; ſo that for ought I know to the contrary, both the One and the Other, the Condition and the Way to it, may be exceeding Deſirable, and full of Felicity. As for thoſe things, which I know to be Evil, ſuch as Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wrong, I have the greateſt abhorrence of them, and avoid them with all poſſible Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and Care; But for ſuch as I know nothing of, I know as little how to Hate, or to Fear them. Now Death I own is one of Theſe; and therefore, Gentlemen, I leave the Matter wholly to You. For really I cannot be ſatisfied, whether is beſt for me; to Die or not to Die; and therefore I hope you will Order what is really beſt; and I am perfectly content you ſhould determine and diſpoſe of me, as you think fit.</q>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And why this mighty Trouble and Concern upon the account of Death? <note place="margin">Of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> This in the Firſt Place is moſt deſpicable Weakneſs, and ſcandalous Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. The mereſt Woman, the moſt tender-hearted Wretch alive can Compoſe her ſelf in a few Days, and put an End to the juſteſt Paſſion, for the Loſs of a Husband, or a Child; and what a Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it to Reaſon, and Wiſdom, that They ſhould not effect that preſently, which in a little while will do itſelf? The moſt Ignorant and poor Spirited Man alive can do it with the help of Time; And why ſhould not a Wiſe and Brave Man do it without that Advantage? For what is Wiſdom, and Reſolution, and Gallantry of Soul good for, or how ſhall we diſtinguiſh it, if it do not quicken a Man's pace,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53648:427"/>and render him more expert and dextrous; ſo that he ſhall be able to do Greater things, and to diſpatch them with greater eaſe and ſpeed, than Others, who are deſtitute of theſe Accompliſhments? From the ſame Weakneſs and Irreſolution it is, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Dying Men, are never ſenſible of their laſt Hours; but ſtill flatter themſelves with Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of perfect Recovery, or longer Delay at leaſt; and perhaps, there is no one paſſage of our Lives comparable to this part for Cheat and Deluſion; none that equally ſooths, and amuſes us with vain hopes. Not that I aſcribe this wholly to Weakneſs neither; for poſſibly Vanity may contribute a great deal toward it. We look upon our Death, as a matter of mighty Conſequence, a ſtrange and moſt important Revolution; in which the whole World is concerned; and can ſcarce be brought to imagine, that Providence will permit a Calamity, in which all Nature muſt ſuffer, and this orderly and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Syſtem of the Univerſe End, and Periſh. So extravagant are the Notions we entertain of our Selves, and of the importance we are of to God and the World.</p>

For if Death be really a Good and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable thing, Wherefore are we afraid of it? And if it be otherwiſe, Why do we make it worſe? This is to aggravate and multiply upon our ſelves the very Thing we pretend moſt to be afraid of; and to create new Pains, and Torments, which Death knows nothing of, nor would ever bring upon us.

Think with your ſelf, how much more Inſupportable, how much more Grievous and Burdenſome a Life muſt needs be, without any Period aſſigned for it; than that Life we now lead, which is attended with a Neceſſity of leaving it, but of laying down the Load that oppreſſes us along with it too? To this purpoſe it is, that the Poets tell us, <hi>Chiron</hi> refuſed to be Immortal, when it was proffered him, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Information from the God of Time (his Father <hi>Saturn</hi>) what hard Conditions the Gift was clogged with. On the other hand, What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the World, if there were not ſomething
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53648:428"/>of Pain and Bitterneſs, which ſhould diſcourage us, and create in us ſome Averſion to Dying? There is no doubt to be made, but were it not for this Check upon our Nature, Men would run out of the World eagerly, greedily embrace Death, and upon every little Pett take Sanctuary here, without any manner of Judgment or Diſtinction, how far the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to carry them. We muſt therefore upon ſecond Thoughts confeſs, that this Mixture is made with Diſcretion; ſit to preſerve us in a due Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſo as neither to be fond of Life, nor pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly weary of it; and ſo again, as neither to be afraid of Death, nor to court and haſten to it; both the One and the Other are tempered with Sweet, and allayed with Bitter; enough of the One to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and make it Tolerable; and ſo much of the Other too, as will keep it from being the Object of any Paſſion in Extremes. So neceſſary are the Ingredients, ſo juſt the Proportions; ſo skilful, and withal ſo tender of our Good, the Hand that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled them.</p>

'Tis upon this Account, that you find them always bid their Friends never Think of Death, and can by no means bear to hear it Named: But ſure This is for many Reaſons a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper Preſcription. For, in the firſt place, ſuch an odd careleſs Temper as This, is ſomewhat ſo contrary to a Man of Parts and Judgment, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſo like a State of Thoughtleſsneſs and Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that none but the Ignorant and the Heavy ſeem capable of the Medicine: Application and Good Senſe cannot Doze away a Life at this rate. But if every Body could bear the Phyſick, yet what
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53648:428"/>Operation, what good Effect is to be expected from it? where would all this End at laſt, and what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Account ſhould we find when we come to the upſhot, and feel how dear this Courſe hath coſt us? For do but imagine the Condition of a Man ſurprized by Death; the Tears, the Agonies, the Groans and Lamentations, the Rage, the Deſpair, in a word, the inexpreſſible Confuſion of being ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed all on the ſudden, by a Mercileſs, Invincible, and Unſeen Enemy. Theſe are ſuch dreadful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that Wiſdom ſure gives much ſafer and better Advice, in directing Men to ſtand their Ground; to face their Enemy; to obſerve his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and provide for the Combat. Nay rather indeed, to encounter him perpetually, by following a Method the direct contrary to That of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; which is, by fixing their Eyes and Thoughts ſteadily upon Death; to converſe, and grow inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with it; to render it gentle and tame by Familiarity and long Uſe. To carry the Idea and the ſtrongeſt Repreſentations of it that we can poſſibly form, conſtantly about with us. To harden our ſelves in the Expectation of it; and that, not only in Times of Sickneſs, and Danger, where we have reaſon to ſuſpect our Selves; but in our moſt confirmed Health; in the midſt of what we call Safety. Death ſhould not be the Companion of our black, and ſullen, and melancholy Hours only; but of our greateſt Gaieties, beſt Humour, and moſt ſolemn Entertainments and Delights. The Sawce to every Diſh; the Burden to every Song ſhould be this Reflection; That we are always in danger, ſet as fair Marks, and that Death is aiming at us; That ſeveral others have been ſnatched away, who thought themſelves as far out of the reach of his Dart, as we can ſuppoſe our ſelves to be now in the heighth of all our Jollity; That an Accident, which happen'd at One Time, or to One Perſon, may as well hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53648:429"/>to Another: And thus we are adviſed by the Wiſeſt Men, to check our Pleaſures, and abate our blind Security, by imitating, as well as ſupplying by Theſe never unſeaſonable Meditations, that Ancient Cuſtom of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who at their Feaſts ſerved up a Death's-head; and that of Chriſtians, and other Perſuaſions too, who contrive, that their Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places ſhall join to their Temples, or be in ſome other Parts the moſt conſpicuous and frequented of any: The Original whereof ſeems to have been, That theſe Publick Monuments might awaken Men's Minds, and preſerve the Reflections and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of Death always freſh and vigorous. Where Death awaits us, is very uncertain; and therefore we ſhould expect to meet it every where, and every moment; and make ſuch conſtant and ſure Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt its coming, that let it ſteal upon us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Cunningly, never ſo Suddenly, it may ſind us always in readineſs. This is no ſuch mortifying Exerciſe, as ſome fondly imagine; quite otherwiſe, it rather ſweetens Life, and recommends its Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſetting us above the Fears, and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and amazing Terrors, which Worldly and Senſual Men feel and labour under.

This indeed is a Complaint moſt uſual, and moſt becoming Mean and Vulgar Souls, who meaſure every thing by the Length; and count nothing valuable, but that which laſts a great while: Whereas on the Contrary, we find, that Things rare, and excellent, and exquiſite in their kind, are generally the moſt fine, and ſubtle, and ſubject to Diſſolution and Decay. 'Tis eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Maſter-piece in Art, to contract a great deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow room; and God and Nature have ſo far taken the ſame Method in their choiceſt Pieces, that a Man would almoſt think it a Fate upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Perſons to be ſhort-liv'd.

For, as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Cry and Tremble at Men in Vizors, but are preſently quiet and lay aſide their Fears, aſſoon as you uncover their Faces; ſo it is here.

And he, who Dyes in Battel, or is Burnt in his Bed; he that falls in an inſtant by the hand of an Executioner, and he that Expires upon a Rack, meet all in the ſelf-ſame State, though they do not come to it the ſame way, and dye the very Death that Women and Children, and all that ſeem to us to Depart in the Eaſieſt, Gentleſt, and moſt Peaceable manner, Dye.

It removes us out of a ſtreight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Dwelling, from a Dark, and Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and Diſeaſed Place, where we can ſee but a very little Spot of Heaven, and only receive Light by Reflection, and at a vaſt diſtance, through Two little Holes of our Eyes; into a Region of abſolute Liberty, confirmed and uninterrupted Health; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and inceſſant Light, a Sun that never ſets, and Endleſs Day without any gloomy Intervals:<note n="*" place="bottom">Aequaliter tibi ſplendebit omne Coeli latus.

This is indeed the Quality of a Good, a Gentle, and well-governed Spirit; and the Practice of it is peculiar to a plain, eaſy way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and to Perſons, who, as they make the beſt of Life, and enjoy the Quiet of it, ſo know very well how to eſteem it as it deſerves; but ſtill they make Reaſon the Standard of all their Affections and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and, as they are well ſatisfied to ſtay here, ſo they readily obey, when Providence thinks fit to call them out of the World, This is a Medium very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered, a Maſterly Greatneſs of Soul; and ſuch an Indifference to all here below, as a Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement and Peace ſeems beſt qualified for; and the Two Extremes between which it lies, are Deſiring and Dreading; Courting and Running away from Death; accoring to that of the Poet:

                        <p>Now theſe Extremes, except there be ſome very particular and uncommon Reaſon to give them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, are both of them Vicious and exceeding blameable; and when I come hereafter to ſpeak of this Matter in its proper place, you will ſee, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a very extraordinary Cauſe can render
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53648:434"/>them ſo much as excuſable. To deſire and purſue Death is very criminal; for it is very unjuſt to throw away one's Life without a ſufficient Reaſon; it is ſpightful to the World, and injurious to our Friends, to grudge them the longer Uſe and Continuance of a thing, which may be ſerviceable to them: It is the blackeſt Ingratitude to God and Nature, thus to ſlight, and throw back again, the beſt and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Preſent they can make us; as if it were a Trifle, or a Burden, not worth our keeping: It ſavours too much of Peeviſhneſs, and Pride; and ſhews us hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome and difficult, when we cannot be eaſy, and bear the Lot that falls to our ſhare; but will needs quit our hands of the Station God hath called us to, when there is nothing extraordinary to render it cumberſome. And on the other hand, to fear and flee Death, when ſummoned to it, is an Offence againſt Nature, Juſtice, Reaſon, and every Branch of our Duty; ſince Dying is Natural, Neceſſary, and Unavoidable; Reaſonable and Juſt.</p>

                        <p> But, which comes nearer home, Death is not only a part of this Great Complex and Univerſal Nature; but of thy Own Nature in particular; and That every whit as eſſential a part, as that Birth which gave Thee Life. So that in cheriſhing an Averſion, and running away from This, thou attempteſt to flee from thy own ſelf. Thy Being is divided equally between Death and Life; Theſe are the Two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and each claims a ſhare, and hath an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible Right in every one of us. Theſe are the Terms, upon which Thou wer't created, and Life was given with a Purpoſe, and upon Condition of being taken away; rather indeed it was only lent, and, like all other Truſts or Debts, muſt be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, and may be called in at pleaſure. If then the Thoughts of Dying diſcontent Thee, conſider, that the Hardſhip does not lye here; but carry thy Reflections higher, and be concerned that ever thou waſt born. For, either there is no cauſe of Repining in either caſe, or elſe the Ground of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint lies in having lived at all. You had Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Fare, and purchaſed Life at the Market Price; which is, The laying it down again; no body hath it cheaper; and therefore they who do not like the Bargain, and are loth to go out again, ſhould have refuſed at firſt, and never come into the World at all. But this is what Men, were they capable of ſuch a Choice, would never do, if their Fondneſs of Life be ſo exceſſively great. The Firſt Breath you drew bound you faſt; and all the Advances you made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a more perfect Life, were ſo many Steps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Death at the ſame time.

                        <p> To be concerned then, that we muſt Dye; is to be concerned that we are Men, for every one that is ſo, is Mortal. And upon the ſtrength of this Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it was, that a Wiſe Man, when the News of his Son's Death was brought him, received it with all the Sedateneſs and ſeeming Unconcernedneſs that could be, and only made this calm Reply; <hi>I knew very well that my Child was Mortal.</hi> Since then Death is a thing ſo Natural, ſo Eſſential to all Nature in general, and contributes ſo much to the Order and Well-being of the Whole World; and ſince it is likewiſe ſo to your own Being, and the Condition of That in particular, why ſhould you conceive ſuch horrible Ideas, why hold it in ſuch irreconcilable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation? In This you act in contradiction to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I allow indeed, that the Fear of Pain is very Natural, but I cannot admit the ſame Plea for the Fear of Death. For how is it poſſible, that Nature ſhould ever have infuſed into us a Principle of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Dread, againſt an Ordinance of her own Inſtitution, and ſuch as ſhe receives ſuch a mighty Benefit from the due Execution of? And, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable Evidence, that ſhe does not ſo, it appears plainly, that, where Nature works entire, without any Depravation or Reſtraint, there little or no Marks of this Paſſion are to be found. Little Children, for inſtance, and Brutes, who are not capable of being corrupted with Prejudice, are ſo far from betraying any Fear of Death, that they meet it chearfully, and ſeem pleaſed to undergo it. The Gay and Smiling Countenances of theſe Creatures are enough to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that Nature does not teach us to fear Death, but we learn That from ſome other hand. But all the Direction we have from Nature upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is, to expect and wait for Death; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes, to receive it with Submiſſion and Chearfulneſs, as conſidering, that it is of Nature's ſending, and expreſs appointment.</p>

And what more exquiſite Folly can a Man be guilty of, than the tormenting himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly, when he knows 'tis to no purpoſe? Where do you find any Man ſo ſtupidly ſilly, to ſpend his Time and his Breath in Intreaties, and importunate Addreſſes, to One whom he knows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of granting, or inflexible and never to be prevailed upon for his Requeſts? Or to knock eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally at a Door, that will not, cannot be opened? And What more inexorable, more deaf to all our Supplications, than Death? If any Calamities be proper Objects of Fear, they are ſuch as are barely Contingencies; which may indeed, but may not happen too. And Thoſe that are capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or Prevention, are fit to have our Thoughts and Care employed upon them. But Thoſe that are fix'd, and muſt come, (which is the Caſe of Death) we have nothing to do but to expect, and to provide for; and all that is to be done with that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured, is to fortify our Souls, and reſolve to endure it. The Ignorant and Inconſiderate fear and flee from Death; The Raſh and Fool-hardy courts and purſues it; The Wiſe Man waits its Approach, and is ready to follow and obey the Summons; but neither runs away from it, nor advances to meet it. But certainly our Lamentations are very Idle and Extravagant, where they are ſure to do no Good; and ſo are our Anxieties and Fears, where there are no means of Eſcape.<note n="*" place="bottom">Feras, non culpes, quod vitari non poteſt.</note> 
                           <hi>You muſt bear, and not complain, when the thing is unavoidable.</hi> The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of <hi>David</hi> was really very prudent;<note place="margin">2 Sam. xii.</note> and an
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53648:436"/>admirable Pattern he hath ſet us in it: When his Servants informed him, that the Child, whoſe Sickneſs he had expreſs'd a moſt paſſionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for, was dead; the next thing he did, was to waſh, and dreſs himſelf, and return to his ordinary way of Eating, and uſual demonſtrations of Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. This indeed was ſomewhat out of the common Road; and thoſe about him, who knew no better, were much aſtoniſhed at his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Account he gave of himſelf was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and ſubſtantial; That, while the darling Infant was yet alive, and conſequently it was yet uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, how God would pleaſe to diſpoſe of him; he faſted, and wept, becauſe he did not know, whether his Prayers might be heard, and God would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in letting the Child live: But as ſoon as he underſtood it was dead, he changed his Courſe; becauſe all Hopes of that kind were then paſt: Life could not be recall'd, nor his Tears and melancholy Humiliations be of any farther uſe in this Caſe. I know well enough, that fooliſh People have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ready for all this. They will tell you, that when a Thing is beyond all Remedy, it is then the fitteſt Object of our Grief; and, that our Concern is at no time ſo ſeaſonable, as when we cannot be better than we now are.

                           <hi>That the greateſt Madneſs a Man can poſſibly be guilty of, is to ſtruggle and fret himſelf, when he ſees and knows all he does is in vain.</hi> Since then the Matter now before us is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, ſo unalterably fix'd, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unavoidable, it is not only to no manner of purpoſe to torment our ſelves with the fear of it; but, if we would take right Meaſures, and make
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53648:437"/>any Profit of this Conſideration, our Method muſt be, to make a Virtue of Neceſſity; and if this grim Gueſt will come, to put on all our good Humour, and prevail with our ſelves to receive him decently, and bid him welcome. For the beſt thing we can do is to be beforehand with him.

If Men are afraid of arriving at this Long Home, they ſhould not move towards it, but ſtand ſtill, or go back again, or get out of the Road: But none of theſe are in their Power to do. What more reaſonable again, than that you ſhould go off this Stage of the World, and make room for new Actors, and a new Scene, as your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors made room for You?

If you had not the Wit to make the beſt of Life, and all its Advantages ſlipt through your Fingers; what Loſs do you ſuſtain in parting with it? What would you do with it any longer? If you could be truſted on, ſtill the Talent would lye unimproved. Obſerve to this purpoſe the Reaſoning of the Poet.

How then can you Argue againſt the Condition of Your own Obligation? How can You falſify Your Truſt, and Act againſt Your Engagement, and Your Duty? It is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to Shuffle and Flinch, and Kick againſt theſe Pricks; becauſe by Death you eaſe your ſelf of a mighty Charge and Trouble; You make up your great Account, and pay in that vaſt Sum, for which you ſtood reſponſible, and which, while in your Cuſtody, was liable to great Loſs and Hazard. Dying is a general thing; Every Body does it, And can You take it Ill not to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted? Do You expect to be the Single Inſtance, the Sole Reſerve from Univerſal Nature; to Enjoy a Privilege by your ſelf; a Privilege never yet ſeen nor heard of in the World? What unparallel'd Folly and Preſumptuous Madneſs is This? Or why ſhould You be afraid to go where all the World goes, where you will find innumerable Millions of Men, who have taken up their Reſidence before you come, and whither you will be followed by as great a Number afterwards? How ſingular an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation is this? Death is equally certain to All; and therefore it cannot be Unreaſonable, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, with reſpect to You; for Equality is the firſt conſtituent part of Equity; and no Man will be forgotten or overlook'd in this Diſtribution.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> The Third Reſentment I mentioned upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is the Contempt of Death, <note place="margin">Contempt of Death Good, if upon a Good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> and This is a Mark of a Brave and Generous Mind; This fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceeds from exalted Judgment, and ſtrength of Reaſon, and is more peculiarly the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Publick Character, Elevated Fortune, and a Life full of Difficult and Weighty Affairs. For to Perſons in ſuch Circumſtances, many Accidents may happen, for which no Man ought to ſcruple Dying; and ſeveral Proſpects preſent themſelves, of Things ſo valuable, that they deſerve to be preferred even before Life it ſelf. Let Other matters ſucceed how they will, This at leaſt is a conſtant Rule; That a Man ought always to be fonder, and have a greater Regard for Himſelf, than for a Life led in hurry and publick Buſineſs; which ſhews him, as it were, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a full Theatre, and expoſes him to the View and Cenſure of all the World. He muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelf, not only as a Spectacle, but as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to Mankind; and remember, That One of the Incumbrances of Honour and Dignity, is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obligation to ſhine brighter than Common Men; to render his Virtue more conſpicuous to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; and to do Things exemplarily Good and Great, though it happen to be at the Expence of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53648:439"/>All that the World calls Dear. To ſuch Perſons many times the ſame Methods of ſafety are denied, which private Men might make uſe of, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon their Prudence, or their Duty. They muſt by no means ſuffer any diminution of their Honour; but when driven to a pinch, muſt Riſque and Sacrifice their Lives, and truſt the Event to Fate. The Great Man, who cannot command himſelf ſo far as to Deſpiſe Death, is not only made thereby incapable of doing any Gallant and eminently Good Action, but he lays himſelf open to more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Dangers, by this Timorous Spirit and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and Thoſe too, ſuch Dangers, as threaten moſt, what requires his beſt care to preſerve. For while his great Concern is to preſerve his Perſon, and ſee that Life be under Covert; his Duty, his Honour, Virtue and Probity lie naked and expoſed; and run a mighty hazard for want of Courage to Protect and Stand by them. The Contempt of Death is in effect the very Principle, to which the Boldeſt and moſt Renowned Exploits are owing; the moſt daring Attempts, whether in Good or Ill Deſigns. He that hath Conquered the Fear of Death, hath nothing more left to terrify him; He hath it in his Power to do what he pleaſes; and may at any time make himſelf Maſter of Another Man's Life, becauſe he is already Maſter of his Own. And, as this Contempt is the true Source of Generoſity and undaunted Firmneſs in Action; ſo is it likewiſe the very Spirit and Life, that quickens and ſupports that Reſolution from whence they proceed. Hence Calmneſs, and Conſtancy, and Perſeverance, All the Free and Bold Determinations, by which Virtue hath expreſſed her ſelf; the Noble and Admired Sentences uttered by Celebrated Perſons, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity of Danger and Diſtreſs: Such as ſhine in Story, give laſting Characters to their Authors, and tranſport the Reader with Wonder
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53648:439"/>and Delight; a very few of which, becauſe they now occur to my Mind, I take the Liberty to inſert here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Helvidius Priſcus,</hi> having received a Meſſage from the Emperor <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> not to appear in the Senate; or, if he came, ſtrictly prohibiting him to interpoſe his Opinion in a Debate, which was to be moved there; ſent back word, That his Character of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator required his Attendance, and he ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his Summons; neither ſhould he, when There, balk any thing that became him; but, if called upon to give his Judgment, would diſcharge his Conſcience, and deliver his Senſe of the Caſe freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear or Reſerve. The Emperor provoked with what he thought Inſolence in this Reply, ſent a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Meſſage, threatning to put him to Death, if he opened his Mouth; To which he returned thus; <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Did I ever tell the Emperor that I was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal? His Majeſty, I ſuppoſe, will do his Pleaſure, and I will take care to do my Duty; It is in His Power to put me to Death Unjuſtly, but it is in my Own to Dye Virtuouſly and Gallantly.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, had entred their Country with his Army, received a terrible Meſſage from him, Threatning what Severity he would uſe them with, if they did not court his Friendſhip, and ſend to make Terms with him. To which one Brisk Fellow Anſwered in behalf of the whole Republick, <hi>What Harm can thoſe Men ſuffer who are not afraid of Death?</hi> And upon another Diſpatch from <hi>Philip,</hi> telling them, That he would break all their Meaſures, and prevent the Deſigns they had formed in their own Defence; The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>How,</hi> Sir, <hi>what break all our Meaſures? No, Sure you will not pretend to hinder us from Dying? This is a Project which you cannot Defeat.</hi> Another, when his Opinion was asked, What courſe a Man could take to live Free and Eaſy, reſolved the Doubt thus,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53648:440"/>That all other Methods were ineffectual, except that One of <hi>Deſpiſing Death.</hi> We read of a Young Boy, who was taken Captive and Sold for a Slave, and in Diſcourſe with his Patron who had Bought him, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>You ſhall now ſee what a purchaſe you have; I ſhould certainly be much to blame, and guilty of great Folly, ſhould I ſubmit to Live in Slavery, when my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is in my own Diſpoſal, and I can retrieve it when I pleaſe:</hi> And with that he threw Himſelf down from the Houſe top, and was daſhed to pieces. While a Perſon was deliberating with himſelf in deep perplexity of Thought, whether he ſhould quit this Life, or not accept that Deliverance, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to tug on ſtill under the weight of a very heavy Calamity, which then oppreſſed him; A Wiſe Man told him, That in His Judgment the Matter under Debate was very ſmall and inconſiderable. <q>For, What is it, ſays he, to Live? Thy Slaves, nay thy Beaſts and Cattel Live; but to Dye like a Man of Honour, and Integrity, and Wiſdom; to leave the World with remarkable Conſtancy and Courage, This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a thing of moment, and worth Studying for.</q> To conclude this Argument; and to crown it with the moſt complete and ſubſtantial Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can poſſibly belong to it; Our moſt Holy Religion owes more of its Succeſs in the World, and more of its Effect upon Men's Hearts and Lives, to this ſingle Principle of getting above the Fear of Death, than to any other Human Foundation whatſoever: No Man can be an excellently Good Chriſtian, who is not Reſolute and Brave; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account we find, that our Great Maſter, who beſt underſtood the Temper of his own Goſpel, does inſiſt upon taking up the Croſs; Hating and Deſpiſing Life for his ſake; not Fearing Men who can only deſtroy the Body, and the like; which are but other Expreſſions for the Contempt of Death; Theſe he inſiſts upon, I ſay, as frequently, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53648:440"/>as upon any other Duty, or Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>Now we muſt underſtand, That there are many Counterfeits and Falſe Pretences to Bravery upon this Occaſion; a great many People, who look big upon the matter, and would fain perſuade the World, nay perhaps are perſuaded Themſelves, That they Deſpiſe Death, and yet are in truth afraid of it. Thus ſeveral People will tell you; They do not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Life; They would be content, nay glad to leave the World; but the Ceremony and Proceſs of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is what They cannot away with. Others again, while in perfect ſoundneſs of Health and Judgment, can think of Death without any Impreſſions of Horror; nay have, as They imagine, ſettled their Minds ſo, as to bear the Shock of it Firm and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and Some have gone farther yet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make it their Choice, their own Act and Deed. This is a Farce very often played; inſomuch that the Soft, the Luxurious <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> himſelf had a Part in it; and made Sumptuous Preparations, that his Death might be as Pompous and Expenſive, as his Life had been. But when Theſe Mighty Men of Valour have come to the Puſh, their Hearts have failed; and either Courage was wanting to give the Blow, or they have repented of ſuch Hardineſs for Raſh Heat and Folly; (as <hi>Lucius Domitius</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, who after he had Poyſoned himſelf, was ſorry for what he had done,) and would fain have Lived, when it was too late. Others turn away their Heads, draw their Cap over their Eyes, and dare not look Death in the Face; They think of it as little as they can; ſteal upon it, and plunge in all on the ſudden; They ſwallow it down like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palatable Phyſick; and haſten to get to the End of that bitter Potion which goes againſt their Stomach. To this purpoſe is that ſaying of <hi>Caeſar, That the Shorteſt Death is the Beſt;</hi> and that of <hi>Pliny, That a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53648:441"/>Sudden and Speedy Diſpatch is the greateſt good Fortune, that can happen to Man in this Stateof Mortality.</hi> Now no Man can truly be ſaid to have Reſolution and Courage, ſuch as is above the Fear of Death, who is afraid of facing, and coming up to it; who dares not meet, and undergo it with his Eyes open, and his Thoughts and Senſes about him. Thus we know ſeveral have done, and therefore this is no Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Excellence, above the Power or Capacity of Human Nature. Thus did <hi>Socrates</hi> particularly, who had Thirty days time to chew the Cud, and digeſt the Sentence pronounced againſt him; and yet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this Foreſight and Conſideration, Dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Diſorder or Paſſion, without any Change in Countenance or Temper; without any ſtruggle or ſign of Reluctancy; in the moſt Calm, Compoſed, Chearful manner, that you at any other time can ſuppoſe a Man in. Thus did <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Tullius Marcellinus,</hi> thoſe Two Gallant <hi>Romans;</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the Philoſopher, who Dyed all Three almoſt alike. For, reſolving to Faſt Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Death, that ſo they might get rid of a very painful Diſtemper, that had made Life a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; and finding their Abſtinence to prove the Beſt Phyſick, and, inſtead of Killing them, to Cure their Diſeaſe; They would not deſiſt, even upon this Recovery; but Finiſhed their Deſign; and took great Satisfaction in Obſerving the gradual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of Nature; and by what Steps and Methods Death gained ground upon them. Among Theſe Fearleſs Men we may reckon <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> too; who, after reſolving to Kill Themſelves, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preparations made in order to it, juſt as they were going to put their Deſign in Execution, took a ſound ſleep. Thus preſerving their Spirits from any Diſorder or Confuſion, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Approaching Death was no more able to caſt them into, than any trifling little Accident
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53648:441"/>in Human Life, would Diſcompoſe a Man of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Judgment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> The Fourth Quality is the Affection of a Great and Generous, a Firm and Reſolute Mind;<note place="margin">Deſire of Death.</note> which hath been often, and with general Approbation practiſed, by Perſons of unqueſtionable Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and eminent Piety. But then they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained this commendable Deſire of Death to Two particular Caſes.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt of Theſe, which ſeems moſt agreeable to Nature, and upon that account may juſtify ſuch a Deſire, is a Life of extreme Calamity and Diſtreſs, of perpetual Uneaſineſs, and exquiſite Pain; Or an Apprehenſion of ſome Death more Scandalous, more Torturing, more Inſupportable, than That which at preſent they ſhould undergo; In a word, a Condition ſo Deplorable, that there is no place left for Hope, no poſſibility of Remedy or Redreſs. Then Death is deſired as a ſure Retreat, and quiet Harbour from the Waves and Storms of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Life; the Beſt and moſt effectual Relief for weary and waſted Nature; the only Refuge and Support of Slaves haraſſed and ill Treated; and, as the Caſe then ſtands, the ſupreme Happineſs a Man is capable of. It is, I own, an Argument of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Littleneſs of Soul, to ſink under Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but it is as ſure an Inſtance of Folly, to cheriſh and be fond of them. And, in my poor Judgment, it is high time to Dye, when (all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances fairly computed,) there is a great deal more Evil than Good in Living. For, as throwing away one's Life raſhly and inconſiderately is againſt Nature, ſo likewiſe is the taking pains to Preſerve it to our own Loſs; and chuſing to Live in Miſery and Torment. When therefore Providence hath reduced us to ſuch a lamentable Condition as This, God will not ſure be Angry, that we wiſh a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe. Some Perſons have run the Point ſo high,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53648:442"/>as to tell you, That Men ought to Dye to avoid the Pleaſures and Temptations, which are highly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Nature; And if ſo, how much ſtronger and more cogent are the Reaſons for avoiding Pain and Grief this way, which are of all things in the World the moſt contrary to Nature? There are, in all Appearance, ſeveral Incidents in Life, worſe and much more formidable than Death: Such as a Man had better Dye than continue under; many Circumſtances, in which, if it were left to any Wiſe Man's Choice, he would infinitely rather quit the World, than ſtay longer in it; So far is Life it ſelf from being a ſufficient Compenſation for all the Evils poſſible to be endured in it. Hence it was, that when <hi>Antipater</hi> threaten'd a great many terrible things, and ſevere Revenge upon the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> Refuſal, if they did not ſubmit preſently, and comply with the Terms he ſent them; They replied, <q>That he did not yet drive them to abſolute Neceſſity; for if the Sufferings he threatned were worſe than Death, they would chuſe That, as the more deſirable of the Two.</q> And it is a Saying uſual with the Philoſophers, <q>That a Wiſe and a Good Man lives as long as it is fit he ſhould, and not as long as poſſibly he can:</q> Which is the Care of thoſe only who ſacrifice their Virtue, their Reputation, their every Thing that is moſt valuable and dear, to lengthen out their Term, and gain, though it be but a little Reſpit from Death.</p>
                        <p>Again. Death is much more at Command, and in our Diſpoſal than Life is, or can be; There is but One Paſſage into the World, and our Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it muſt be aſſiſted by the Will of Others; Our Ways out again are Infinite, and our Departure hence needs no Conſent, but our Own: And the more chearful and contented we are at our leaving it, the more becoming and reputable is our Exit. We may want Lands and Revenues ſufficient to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53648:442"/>maintain us while Living, but no Man can want enough to receive him when Dead; This is a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, which neither Poverty nor Prodigality can alienate. No Man is ſo deſpicable, but he may have the Life of any other Man at his Mercy; no Place ſo ſecure, none ſo ſtrong, as to be inacceſſible to Death; for as the <hi>Tragedian</hi> obſerves moſt truly;

                        <p>The Second Caſe, wherein the Deſire of Death is moſt practicable and moſt commendable, is purely
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53648:443"/>Religious; when Men have entertained ſuch ſtrong and lively Apprehenſions, and thoſe Apprehenſions have kindled ſuch eager Wiſhes, of a Future State, that Death is longed for with great Impatience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe This is look'd upon as a Gain and mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; the Seed from whence a Rich Crop ſhall ſpring up to a better Life; the Paſſage to the Seats of Bliſs, and Inlet to Full and Perfect Happineſs; the Storehouſe where We and all our Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſafely depoſited, to be produced with vaſt Improvement at the Reſurrection. Theſe are Things of that Moment and Infinite Value to us, that a firm Belief and ſtedfaſt Hope of them is very hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Fear and Loathneſs to dye: For ſure, if this Principle were purſued through all its Conſequences, the Effect muſt needs be, to make us diſſatisfied with Life, and weary of being confined here ſo long, and at ſo great a diſtance from our Happineſs: Life upon theſe Terms ſhould be barely ſupportable, but Death our Choice, and the Object of our Love and Deſire: To ſuch Men, Living muſt needs be a Toil, and a Burden; and Death an Eaſe and Refreſhment, after much Suffering, and hard Labour.

This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath at firſt bluſh a good fair Appearance; and ſeems to proceed from Virtue, and Greatneſs of Spirit: And certain it is, that the Allowance and the Practice of it hath been both Frequent and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Many Inſtances of this kind live in Story, Perſons eminently Great, and Good; of almoſt every Countrey, and every Religion. <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans, Egyptians, Perſians, Medes, Gauls, Indians;</hi> Philoſophers of all Sects, nay <hi>Jews</hi> too; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Fact of old <hi>Razias,</hi> who hath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Character of <hi>The Father of his Countrey</hi> given him,<note place="margin">2 Mac. xiv.</note> and is conſtantly mentioned with Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Virtue: Another Inſtance the ſame Hiſtory gives us likewiſe in thoſe Women under the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53648:444"/>
                           <hi>Maxentius.</hi> And, as if ſingle Perſons were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify this Practice, we have whole Cities and Nations giving Authority to it by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus did the Citizens of <hi>Capua,</hi> to avoid being taken by the <hi>Romans;</hi> thus did <hi>Aſtapa</hi> and <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> upon the ſame account. Thus the <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> when hard preſſed by <hi>Philip;</hi> and a City of the <hi>Indians,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> had encamped againſt it. This hath likewiſe had the yet more Authentick Approbations of Laws and Publick Sanctions; and ſeveral Commonwealths have not only permitted, but recommended, and in ſome Caſes brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cuſtom; as <hi>Marſeilles</hi> heretofore, the Iſle of <hi>Cea</hi> in the <hi>Negropont,</hi> and ſome <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, in particular; where the Publick Juſtice regulated the Times, and the Methods of doing this. Nor is it only upon Precedents, that the Favourers of this Opinion do rely, but they think it abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Reaſon; and particularly, that ſeveral Arguments of Weight may be deduced from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Article to juſtify it. For, ſay They, if a Deſire and Willingneſs to dye, be not Allowable only, but Commendable too; if we may Wiſh and Pray for a Releaſe; if we may put our ſelves in the way of it, and be glad when it is offered; why may we not Give this Relief to our Selves? Is the Deſire it ſelf a Virtue, and the Execution of that Deſire a Sin? What is permitted in the Will, why do you call for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Act? That which I may be pleaſed with from Another hand, why ſhould I be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for from my Own? Indeed why ſhould I wait the tedious Approach of that from other means, which I can at any time give to my ſelf? For is it not better to Act in this Caſe, than to be purely Paſſive? Is it not more Manly and Generous to Meet Death, than lazily to ſit ſtill and attend its Motions? The more Voluntary our Death is, the more like a Man of Honour. Again; What Law does this offend
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53648:444"/>againſt? There are Penalties indeed ordained for Robbers and Pick-pockets, but is any Man liable to them for taking his Own Goods? By the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Laws againſt Murder do not concern Me. They provide for every man's Security againſt the Inſults of Others;<note place="margin">See the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions at the End of this Chapter.</note> they tye my Neighbour's hands from taking My Life, and Mine up from taking His; becauſe this is ſuppoſed to be an Act of Violence, and want of Conſent in the Sufferer makes it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; but what is all This to the purpoſe, or how does it render a Man guilty, who voluntarily and deliberately takes away his own Life? Theſe are the Principal, I think indeed, the Whole of thoſe Arguments commonly alledg'd in Defence of this Practice; but then there are Others a great deal more Subſtantial, and more Obligatory, that uſe to be produced for the Contrary Side of the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then. As to Authorities, This Practice, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever countenanced by ſome, but very few States in compariſon, hath yet been abſolutely diſallow'd, and condemned by the Generality of Mankind; and not only by Chriſtians, but <hi>Jews</hi> too,<note place="margin">

For what can we ſay better of it, than that This is skulking and running out of the way, to hide one's ſelf from the Inſults of Fortune? Now a Virtue that is vigorous and ſtanch, will be ſure to ſtand its ground: Diſtreſs and Pain are ſo far from making it flinch, that they feed and cheriſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt it; it lives, it grows, it triumphs by them.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53648:445"/>is certainly greater Firmneſs of Mind expreſs'd in bearing and making an Advantage of one's Chain, than in breaking it to pieces, becauſe it keeps us confined, and ties us faſt to ſome Uneaſineſſes: And all conſiderate Men muſt allow, that <hi>Regulus</hi> ſhew'd infinitely more Gallantry than <hi>Cato.</hi>

This is highly ungrateful to God and Nature, when ſo Rich a Preſent is ſo much ſlighted and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; It is an Argument of great Levity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays a great deal of Moroſeneſs and Ill Humour, when we quarrel and break Company upon every ſlender Provocation.

For the Chriſtian Religion admits no reaſon to be ſufficient in this Caſe, nor ever diſpenſes with any Circumſtances whatſoever. The Truth and Wiſdom of God abſolutely condemns all ſuch Officious and Voluntary abandoning of our Poſt; and never ſuffers us to ſtir from our Duty, till we are regularly diſmiſs'd, by the ſame Authority which placed us in it. No Man's own Inclinations are ſufficient, nor can the doing it of his own head bear him out in this matter. So that whatever hath been ſaid in this Chapter, which may ſeem in any degree to adviſe Men to Patience and Perſeverance, and to propoſe This, as the better and more eligible; though, in the Philoſophical Senſe, it be only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as Good Counſel; yet in a Religious one, it hath the force of an abſolute and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Command.</p>
                        <p>Beſides we may add, That it is an Argument of very great Wiſdom, for a Man to know and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh rightly, which is the proper ſeaſon for Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to lay hold on that Opportunity, when put into his hands. For every Man hath a Critical juncture of this kind, in which Virtue and Honour call; which Some by being over-haſty Antedate, and Others as much too ſlow let ſlip through their Hands. Both theſe Defects, though ſo contrary in the Operation, yet proceed from the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; which are a mixture of Weakneſs, and of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53648:448"/>Courage: But the Misfortune is, That even Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity it ſelf, without Diſcretion to Temper and Direct it, will not ſecure a Man's Character. How many Perſons of juſt Renown, and once unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed Honour, have yet had the Unhappineſs of ſurviving their Reputation; and from an Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fondneſs of Life, for the ſake of ſome poor little addition to their Days, have abſolutely Sullied and Eclipſed their former Glories, followed all their Credit to the Grave, a good Name Murthered and Buried by their Own Hands? The wretched re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their time hath retained not the leaſt Tincture or Reſemblance of what went before; but the Scandal of Their Age, compared with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their earlier Years, looks like ſome wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old Clout, tack'd to ſome very Rich and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Garment. And who would patch up Life at this Odious Deformed rate? It is with This, as with Fruit; there is a Critical Seaſon of gathering it from the Tree. If you let it hang too long, it putrifies and grows Inſipid; and the longer you ſpare it, the worſe it is; and if you pluck it too ſoon, the loſs is as great in the other Extreme; for then it is Green and Sowr, and good for nothing for want of kindly Ripening.</p>
                        <p>Many Eminent Saints have with great Induſtry declined Dying, upon conſideration of their great Uſefulneſs, and the mighty Advantage the Publick would receive from their Surviving; and this too, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the certain Proſpect of their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain in leaving the World. And when a Man can exchange ſo much for the better, it argues great Charity, to be content to Live. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to be his own Caſe, (<hi>Phil.</hi> I.) And there is more than Men commonly think of Reſignation in that Old Saying, <hi>If my longer Continuance be for the Benefit of thy People, I refuſe not the toil of Living. Si Populo tuo ſum neceſſarius, non recuſo Laborem.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Death appears to us under divers Shapes; and the manner of Men's undergoing it, is vaſtly different; ſome of the ways of Dying are more eaſy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Figures and Idea's of it much leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and frightful, than Others. But when all is done; the Difference of theſe Forms, is like that of Faces; and the Preference given to them depends chiefly upon Humour and Fancy. So far as I am capable of Judging, Of all Deaths which are uſually termed Natural, That is the Gentleſt and moſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, which proceeds from a gradual Weakneſs, and Stupefaction of the Parts: And of All that are Violent, That ſure is moſt eligible, which is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Execution and Diſpatch, and is leaſt thought of before-hand. Some indeed are fond of making their laſt Act Exemplary, a Pattern to Others, and a Commendation to Themſelves; by the Proofs they give the World of Courage, and Wiſdom, and Steadineſs of Mind at their laſt Hour; But This is rather to have a regard for Other People than One's Self; and a Symptom of a Vainglorious Humour, which is greedy of Fame, even at the Moment we Expire; and reproaches Us with Vanity, rather than brings any real Advantage to Mankind in common. Now Dying is not an Act of Society, but of One ſingle Perſon; and therefore the Rules for Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Behaviour in it are Perſonal. At ſuch a time a Man hath enough to do, to mind his own Buſineſs; and the Thing he is chiefly obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is to Comfort and Support himſelf in this laſt great Conflict, without troubling himſelf with the Affairs, or the Cenſures of other People; for he is that very Moment putting himſelf out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Common Fame, and going to a Place, where what the ſurviving World ſays will neither reach nor concern him. That, in a word, is the Beſt Death, which is moſt Private; where a Man hath greateſt opportunities of Recollecting himſelf,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53648:449"/>and going out of the World Quietly, without any troubleſome Attendance or Obſervation. The uſual Ceremonies of our Friends and Relations being by, and giving Their Aſſiſtance in the laſt Struggles of Life, is exceeding Troubleſome and Inconvenient; One Diſturbs your Sight with an Object that had better be away; Another your Ear with ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Diſcourſe; a Third your Mouth by forcing upon you ſome fruitleſs Medicine or Suſtenance; and All together Croud, and Confound, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Stifle the Dying Man. Then their Tears, and Groans, and Lamentations, are more Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than all the reſt; if they be Real, and proceed from Affection and Concern, they melt one down, break one's Courage and Reſolution, and cut one to the very Heart: If they be Formal only, and put on for Decency or Deſign; they raiſe one's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and provoke a very unſeaſonable Paſſion in the very midſt of Agonies and Convulſions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral very Conſiderable Perſons have been ſo ſenſible of this Inconvenience, that they have contrived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly, to Dye at a diſtance from their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on purpoſe to be out of the way of it. And ſure That which moves many People to deſire the contrary, is very ridiculous. For what can be more Childiſh and Senfleſs, than to pleaſe one's ſelf with moving the Compaſſion of Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and be proud that a great many People expreſs a tender Concern for what we Endure? We cannot but commend Firmneſs of Mind, and a Hardy Virtue in encountring Misfortunes; We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort our Friends to it, when it is their Own Caſe, and upbraid them with Weakneſs, if they take it too tenderly; and yet this very Virtue we hate, and accuſe as inhuman and wanting in Affection, when the Calamity is Ours. Then They who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly chidden for reſenting their Own, are reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they are too afflicted, and do not perfectly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53648:449"/>ſink under Our Sufferings. We condemn their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints for what they feel; and yet we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them ſo much as to be patient under what they only ſee. This is unjuſt, unreaſonable, and fooliſh to the laſt degree. And certainly a Wiſe Man when ſick, ſhould be very well content at leaſt, if not much better pleaſed, with the Compoſed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and reſigned Behaviour, of all the Friends that aſſiſt in his Extremities.</p>

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A Quiet and Contented Mind is the Supreme Good, the utmoſt Felicity Man is capable of in This World. This is that Rich and Noble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ineſtimable Treaſure, which the Wiſe Men of Old with ſo much Labour and Application ſought after; the Fruit of all their Travels, the End of all their Studies, the Sum and Complement of all their Philoſophy; and This is the very Reward of all the Pains, and the Crown of all the Wiſdom, to which I am now Inſtituting my Scholar in this Treatiſe. But This, like other Excellencies, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſunderſtood; and therefore to prevent any ſuch Errors at preſent, I muſt firſt acquaint you, That the Quiet I now ſpeak of, does by no means conſiſt in a Retreat from the Noiſe and Clutter of the World, Leiſure from Buſineſs, Time at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, no Cares to diſturb one; a Delightful, Nice, and uninterrupted Solitude, full of Eaſe and Plenty; or in a profound Neglect and Oblivion of what is done Abroad: Were this the Caſe, what an infinite Number of happy Perſons ſhould we have? Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Idle Women, Slothful and Inſignificant Fellows, Cowards and Coxcombs, the Senſual and Luxurious, would have this Bleſſing at Command. For if want of Thought and Buſineſs give a Title
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53648:450"/>to it, Theirs is indiſputable; and what the Wiſe aſpire after, and think a Prize ſufficient for a whole Life's Study, Theſe attain to by a much eaſier way. This then is the firſt Principle we are to go upon, That Multiplicity of Buſineſs, or Having nothing to do, neither of them conſtitute or deſtroy, take from or contribute to, the Tranquillity we are now ſpeaking of. But This is a Decent and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a Gentle and Mild, an Equal and United, a Firm and Pleaſant Compoſure of Temper. Such a Steadineſs of Mind, as neither Buſineſs nor Leiſure, neither Proſperous nor Adverſe Fortune, no Turn of Time or Chance can diſturb or change, exalt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. For This is the Property and<note n="*" place="bottom">Vera Tranquillitas non concuti.</note> 
                           <hi>Character of true Tranquillity, Never to be ſhaken;</hi> but to continue immoveable, and unconcerned; always in humour, and always the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The next Conſideration upon this Occaſion, is, By what Methods a Man may riſe up to this Sedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Elevation of Soul; how we ſhall attain; and when attained, how we ſhall preſerve, and maintain our ſelves in it. And for This we need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſh our Memories, with what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered in this Second Book: For They are the Rules, by the Obſervation and careful Practice whereof we may hope to gain our Point. And therefore, for the Reader's Eaſe and better Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, I will here very briefly repeat the Subſtance of them. They conſiſted, you remember, of Two ſorts. Firſt, ſuch as either carry off, or prevent all thoſe Qualities, that are Obſtructions to our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in this Happineſs. And 2dly, Such as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and adorn the Mind, with ſuch Virtues as tend to the Increaſe and Conſervation of it. Thoſe Things that are apteſt to hinder, or to diſturb the Eaſe and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53648:451"/>Quiet of the Mind; are Popular Opinions, and Common Prejudices, which, notwithſtanding they have made themſelves almoſt Univerſal, are yet, for the moſt part, Falſe and Groundleſs; and a Man would wonder, which way Notions could get ſo much Credit, which have ſo very ſmall a Stock of Argument to ſet up upon. The next Impediment to be removed ariſes from our Paſſions and Deſires, for Theſe indulged quite ſpoil and break our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; they make us Nice and Squeamiſh; Humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and Difficult; and Theſe are Qualities utterly inconſiſtent with Contentedneſs: Now Theſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Appetites are kindled and put into motion, by the Two contrary ſorts of Events, which we call Proſperity and Adverſity; for They are the Winds and Storms, that ſwell and diſorder the Soul, and make all within foul Weather, and a troubled Sea. The laſt thing to be remedied is that mean and narrow-ſpirited Captivity of Thought, by which the Mind (that is, the Judgment and the Will,) is Chained down like a Slave to his Galley, or cramp'd up like a Beaſt with his Yoke, to ſet Forms, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Opinions, and Local Cuſtoms. Now the firſt thing a Man hath to do, is to knock off all theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>etters, and break through ſuch unreaſonable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Conſinement; to ſet one's Mind at large, aſſert our native Liberty, and reſolve to be at our own diſpoſal. To entertain free, extenſive Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things; and be Open and Univerſal, Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and Diſcerning, enlarging our Studies and our Idea's, and ranging through all the ſpacious Plains of the World and Nature in general. For a Wiſe and Happy Man muſt anſwer that Deſcription;<note n="*" place="bottom">In commune genitus, mundum ut umm domum ſpectans, toti ſe inferens mundo, &amp; in omnes ejus actus contemplationem ſuam mittens.</note> 
                           <hi>Born for the Publick, conſidering this whole World as

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When the Platform is thus cleared of Rubbiſh, and the Ground prepared, and ready to begin upon, the next thing in order is to lay the Foundations; and thoſe are Two, An entire ſubſtantial Probity of Mind, and The Fixing one's ſelf in ſuch a Calling or Condition, as our Nature, Circumſtances, and other Qualifications have fitted us for. The Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, with which this Building muſt be carried up, and wherein both the Strength and Beauty of it will conſiſt, are theſe that follow. The Firſt and Principal is, True Piety; whereby a Man Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates Almighty God, not with a Soul full of Horror and Amazement, but with a Mind full of Purity, with Freedom and Delight, with profound Reſpect, and fervent Devotion. For God is the Abſolute, the Univerſal Lord and Governor of all Things; and, though his Nature and Eſſence be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible to our Senſes, nor fall within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of our Underſtandings, ſo that we are not able to give our Selves, or Others, an exact and perfect Account what He is in Himſelf; yet it is our Duty to Acknowledge and Confeſs Him; to pay him all poſſible Honour, and Homage, and humble Adoration; to Serve Him Zealouſly, and with our whole Heart; to entertain becoming Thoughts of his Providence and Perfections; to Hope and Truſt in Him for all manner of Good, from the Being who is Goodneſs in the Abſtract; to apprehend nothing of Evil or Injury from Him; but be aſſured, if any thing we reſent as ſuch, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us, it is the Effect of our own Provocations and Follies, and moſt juſtly inflicted. In the next place, Simplicity and Integrity in Converſation muſt be added, Conformity without troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Scruples to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53648:452"/>Place where we dwell; Living without Hypocriſy or Diſſimulation, Dealing Fairly and Above-board, no Crafty Reſervation or Diſguiſe, but to let our Words and Actions ſpeak our Heart; and the inmoſt receſſes of our Soul be thus laid open to God and the World. This is another Character given of a Wiſe Man; That he<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſcientiam ſuam aperi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <hi>Spreads his Conſcience, as it were, and expoſes it to Publick view, Lives and Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as if all Mankind were Conſcious of what he does, and hath a greater Reverence for Himſelf than for the Obſervation of Others.</hi> He that Manages himſelf thus, can never want Encouragement to do well, nor powerful Reſtraints from doing otherwiſe. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Moderation, which muſt extend to All Perſons and Things; our Selves, and All that can be any way concerned or converſe with Us; our Thoughts, and Words, our Deſigns, and Actions, muſt All be regulated by it. For Moderation is the Original and Source, the Nouriſher and Cheriſher of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; by This we learn to lay aſide and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all Pomp, and Shew, and vain Superfluities; to bring our Deſires within their proper compaſs; to keep them under Government, and to content our ſelves with a Competent proviſion, ſuch propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every thing as our Occaſions require, when really and rightly conſidered, without any of thoſe Imaginary Wants, which we are apt to form to our ſelves: And thus Diſpoſed we come to like, and be very well pleaſed with our preſent Condition, not envious of other People's Enjoyments, not fond of Change. How much all this conduces to Happineſs and Tranquillity, a very ſlight Reflection will ſerve to convince us: For when Moderation hath thus furled the Sails, The Storm, when it blows hard,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53648:452"/>hath leſs to faſten upon; and cannot do us any Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage comparable to that we ſhould ſuffer, if our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were enlarged, and the Sheet let fly to the Wind. By thus contracting our ſelves, we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt every Accident that might Shock or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us; we bear our Minds up above all manner of Fear; deſpiſe all the Aſſaults of Fortune, and the Malice of Death it ſelf; looking upon that, as the period of all our Sufferings; a kind Friend which takes us out of the way from infinite Calamities, but creates not, nor expoſes us to any one. Thus alſo the Wiſe Man is deſcribed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Contemptor omnium, quibus torquetur Vita: ſupra omnia quae contingunt acciduntque eminens. Intrepidus, Impertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus.</note> 
                           <hi>One that deſpiſes all thoſe things which are the Plagues and Torments of Human Life; above the reach of Accidents, without Anxiety, without Fear, without any kind of tender or troubleſome Concern.</hi> Thus a Man muſt ſecure Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, and a good Agreement with himſelf; he muſt look for his Satisfaction in his own Breaſt; Live Eaſily, and have no Diſputes, no Trouble within; but keep all there Peaceable, and Chearful; Rejoycing and Congratulating with one's own Mind; and Dwelling, as we call it, at Home, with full Contentation, and a ſort of Self-ſufficiency; ſuch as is highly Neceſſary and Commendable, ſuch as nothing but Wiſdom can give, and without which neither It, nor the Happineſs it propoſes for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, can poſſibly ſubſiſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Niſi Sapienti ſua non placent.

                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:53648:453"/>
                        <p> In a word. To this Compoſition of an Eaſy and Quiet Mind Two Ingredients are indiſpenſably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. The Firſt, and indeed the Chief, is a Clear and a Good Conſcience; which does inſpire Men with wonderful Strength and Aſſurance, and is a mighty Stay, and Defence, and Support in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Contingencies. But yet This, as mighty as it is, will not ſingly be a ſufficient Defence; for ſometimes the Tempeſt is ſo exceeding fierce and ſtrong, that all the Innocence in the World is not able to bear up againſt it. How often do we ſee very good Men in very grievous Calamities, deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and at a loſs? Nay, our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf mentions ſome Tribulations of his foretelling, which ſhould endanger even ſeducing the very Elect. To This therefore we muſt add One more, which is Strength of Mind, and Natural Courage; and of this too it muſt much more be allowed, that It alone is by no means ſufficient for our purpoſe. For the Force of Conſcience is prodigious, and almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable; It ſtares us in the face, haunts and dogs us with guilty Remorſe, makes us betray, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and turn Enemies to our ſelves; and for want of other Evidence to convict us, it compels us to inform, and give Teſtimony of our own Crimes.

There muſt be a Friendly Correſpondence, a Mutual Aſſiſtance of Both; and They, in whoſe Souls both meet together, are qualified to do Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and ſuch are the moſt Eminent Perſons, which we find renowned in Story for Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions, and Intrepid Behaviour in Times of greateſt Trial.

                        <hi>AN Imagination, which, "to thoſe who think Sacrifices to <q>have been of human Invention</q> ſeems to have been the Ground of all that way of Worſhip.</hi> I have, in the rendring of this Paſſage, added thoſe words, "To thoſe who think Sacrifices to have been of human Invention," not ſuppoſing it at all proper, to let the Sentence run in general Terms, when the Matter affirmed here by our Author is, (to ſay the leaſt of it,) ſo very diſputable. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I beg the Reader's Leave to detain him a little upon this occaſion, while I lay before him the miſtake of our Author, in theſe Two particulars, with Relation to Sacrifices; The Firſt whereof is deſigned to ſhew, that Sacrifices were not at all of Human Invention Originally, The Second, That ſuppoſing them to have been ſo, yet this Superſtitious and Falſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a God taking delight in the Sufferings and Calamities of his Creatures, does not ſeem to have been the Foundation of them, but rather Other Notions of the Deity, of a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind from This.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, I deſire it may be conſidered, Whether Sacrifices were Originally of Human Invention at all; which they muſt needs have been, to juſtify Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi>'s Opinion of their proceeding from an Erroneous and moſt unbecoming Idea of God, entertained in the Minds of Ignorant Men. This indeed hath been a Point upon which Learned Men have differed in all Ages, and very great Authorities it is to be confeſs'd there are on both Sides. The Learned Reader, who hath the Leiſure and Curioſity to inform himſelf how this matter ſtands, may ſee the variety of Judgments, and the Ground of them, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commentators upon the Fourth and Eight Chapters of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53648:455"/>
                        <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where the Sacrifices of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> are mentioned; Or if that be too Laborious to compare Expoſitors, Two of our Learned Countrymen will help him to a ſhort and full Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what can be ſaid for that ſide, which aſſerts the Human Invention of Sacrifices. Dr. <hi>Outram, I mean, in his Book, De Sacrificijs</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 1. <hi>De Sacrificiorum Origine.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Spencer in his Treatiſe de Legibus Hebraeorum,</hi> Lib. 3. Diſſert. 2. Cap. 4. <hi>De Ratione &amp; Origine Sacrificiorum Patriarchalium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be too great an Expence both of the Reader's time and my own, as well as improper for the nature of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, to lay down at large all that is uſually argued on both ſides of the Queſtion. The ſum of it may be reduced within a narrow Compaſs; and therefore I ſhall with all poſſible Brevity, mention the Arguments of Thoſe, who maintain the Human Invention of Sacrifices, together with the Reaſons which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may perſuade the Contrary rather, and that in regard they either ſeem to take off the Force of Their Arguments; or otherwiſe recommend the Divine Inſtitution of Sacrifices, as an Opinion more probable, and liable to leſs Difficulties.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Firſt then, It is urged, That God himſelf denies, that he ever Inſtituted Sacrifices, till after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Deliverance out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; from whence the Concluſion is this; That whatſoever Sacrifices were offered before that time, they muſt neceſſarily be of Man's own Deviſing, ſince we have the Teſtimony of God, declaring in very ſolemn manner, that they were not of His Appointment. The Texts inſiſted upon to this purpoſe are thoſe two, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> I. 11, 12. <hi>To what purpoſe is the Multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord? I am full of the Burnt-Offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Beaſts, and I delight not in the Blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He-goats; when ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts?</hi> The Other, <hi>Jerem</hi> VII. 21, 22. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Put your Burnt-offerings unto your Sacrifices, and eat Fleſh. For I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in the day, that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning Burnt offerings or Sacrifices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now any One, who conſiders the Occaſion of theſe Paſſages, will find that both of them are intended for a Reproof to the Hypocriſy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a Check to that Confidence, they repoſed in thoſe Ritual Performances, though void of that real Devotion, and inward Purity, which alone was acceptable to God. The Context in each place manifeſtly proves this to have been their deſign, and the want of Comparative degrees in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </q> I add too, that this Text of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be taken in a ſtrict and literal Senſe, ſince it is manifeſt God did ſpeak to their Fathers in the very day that he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> concerning one Sacrifice, the Paſſeover, I mean,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">II. A Second Argument is drawn from <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, each the product of his own Labours reſpectively, which makes it probable, that ſuch Oblations were the product of a grateful Mind, dictating to them that God ought to have ſome acknowledgment and return made him for his Benefits. Now that Nature might inform Men, of a Duty incumbent upon them to Worſhip God, and the Common Notions of Gratitude put them upon applying part of their Subſtance to the Honour and Service of Him, who gave the whole, Men find eaſy to apprehend. But the difficulty is, How Nature ſhould inſpire Men with a Thought, that Burning this by Fire, or otherwiſe ordering it, as the Cuſtom of Sacrificers was, is a proper Method of expreſſing their Honour for, and Gratitude to God. Again, Had Sacrifices been a dictate of Nature, How came they ever to be Aboliſhed, ſince the Natural is part of that Law, which our Saviour came <hi>not to deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>perfect and fulfill?</hi>

Whether this be ſufficient to clear the Difficulty, I leave the Reader to judge, and for that purpoſe I have preſented him with
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53648:456"/>the whole Paſſage in the<note n="*" place="bottom">Id unum hoc in loco monere viſum est, hos qui ſuâ cujuſque ſponte primò Sacrificatum judicant, etiamſi fortè, quibusdam in locis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautius loqus videantur; hunc tamen Sacrificandi ritum ad Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Leges proprtè dictas, aeternas utique &amp; immutabiles non referre; ſed ad ejuſmodt Inſtituta, quae Ratio Naturalis excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit tanquam ad conſpicuum Dei cultum, apta ſatis &amp; idonea.

I. Cap. 1. Sect. IV.</hi>
                        </note> Margin. One thing only I deſire may be obſerved, which is, That this Argument, of what force ſoever it may prove, for Sacrifices of Thanks, yet can give no Countenance at all to Thoſe of any Other Sort; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to the Expiatory, which Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> hath chiefly regard to, if not to them alone, in this place.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A Third Reaſon is taken from the great Deſign God ſeems to have had in the Legal Sacrifices, That of containing the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> within the Worſhip of One God, and in order to it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending ſo far to their Infirmities, and the Infection they had taken from the Idolatry of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as to conform their Worſhip and Rites to thoſe of the Heathen World. Now it is not to be denied, but this ſeem to have been the Caſe, and probably the beſt account why ſuch particular Rites were inſtituted; but to make the Argument effectual, we muſt enquire, how thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then came by Their Sacrifices and Ceremonies. For That may be a very good and rational Explanation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Inſtitution, which is not a ſufficient account of the Patriarchal Religion. And in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe my Reader will find occaſion to conſider, whether there were not another End to be ſerved by the Sacrifices both Patriarchal and Levitical, which mere Nature could not attain to, and therefore a Poſitive Inſtitution was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the promoting it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It may be ſaid Fourthly, That as God left the firſt Ages of the World, to the Dictates of Nature and right Reaſon in the Diſcovery and Practice of Moral Duties, ſo it is moſt likely they were left to the ſame Guidance for the exerciſe of Religion too; and if any Notions and Ceremonies grew common upon this occaſion, not ſo agreeable to the Nature of true Religion, and the Dignity of an Almighty Majeſty; theſe are capable of great Allowances, and ſuit well enough with the Simplicity of the Firſt Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p>To This I preſume it may ſuffice to anſwer, That the Caſe of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53648:456"/>Moral Duties, and Religious Rites is very different: The One are purely the reſult of a reaſonable and thinking Mind; The Other of a Nature which we muſt needs be much in the dark about. For though Reaſon would convince me, that God is to be worſhipped, yet He alone can tell me, what Worſhip will be acceptable to him. At leaſt, if I muſt beat out my own Track, the Notions I entertain of God muſt direct me. Now Theſe might convince a Man, that Purity and Sincerity, Juſtice and Goodneſs, and the like, muſt needs pleaſe an Infinitely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being. But which way could an Imagination ſo foreign en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Mens heads, as that God ſhold be pleaſed with the Blood and Fat of Beaſts? Admit Theſe to have been the Chief of their Subſtance, and devoted, becauſe as ſuch fitteſt for them to expreſs their Acknowledgments by; that as devoted and entirely, ſet apart to Holy Uſes, it could not without Sacrilege be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by Men, and that from hence the Cuſtom of Burning the Sacrifice took its Original: yet what ſhall we ſay to the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Oblations? And how could Men by any Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon comprehend the Poſſibility of a Vicarious Puniſhment; or hope that the Divine Juſtice ſhould be appeaſed by Offerings of this kind, and accept the Life of the Offender's Beaſt, inſtead of the forfeit Life of the Offender himſelf? Theſe things ſeem to be far out of the Way and Reach of human Diſcourſe; it is ſcarce, if at all, poſſible to conceive, what ſhould lead the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Mankind to ſuch Conſequences, ſuch Ideas of God as Theſe: And I think little needs be ſaid to convince Men, that the Difference is vaſtly great between ſuch Religious Rites, and thoſe Moral Duties which have their foundation in the beſt Reaſon, and are all of them ſo coherent, ſo agreeable to ſober and uncorrupted Nature, that the more we attend, and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer we purſue them, the greater Diſcoveries we ſhall be ſure to make, and the more conſiſtent will be all our Actions with the firſt, and moſt obvious Principles of the Mind. So that no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Argument can lye between theſe Two.</p>
                     <p>The Force of this Reaſon is ſufficiently confeſs'd by the very Learned Aſſerter of that Other Opinion; nor can he deny,<note place="margin">Spencer, Lib. <hi>III.</hi> Cap. <hi>IV.</hi> Diſſ. <hi>II.</hi> Sect. <hi>II.</hi>
                        </note> (as ſome, I think, with a deſign to make ſhort work of it, have done,) that Expiatory Sacrifices were offer'd before the Law: But then Theſe are ſuppoſed to proceed not from any poſitive perſuaſion, or good aſſurance of obtaining Pardon by that means; but ſome Hope, that God would have regard to the Pious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Perſon, and conſider and reſtore him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Which Opinion <hi>Arnobius</hi> expoſes in ſuch a manner, as plainly to ſhew, that it generally prevailed; and many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Heathen Writers themſelves confeſs, that they looked upon God to be capable of being mollified and won over, as Angry Men are, by Submiſſions, and Preſents, and other ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53648:457"/>Methods. All which Miſapprehenſions are conceived agreeable to the Darkneſs of Pagans, and the Simplicity of Earlier Ages.</p>
                     <p>Now with all due Reverence to the Authority of thoſe Great Men who urge it, I can by no means ſatisfy my ſelf with the Colour they give to theſe Arguments, from the rude unpoliſhed State of Men in the firſt Ages of the World. This, I know, is a Notion very agreeable to the Heathen Philoſophers and Poets, and Their Accounts of the Original of this World, the Progreſs of Knowledge, and Improvement of Mankind. And This might probably agree well enough with that Age when <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed were choſen out from the midſt of a dark and degenerate Race. But whether it agree with the Times of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Fathers, will bear a great Diſpute. We fancy perhaps, that, before there was any Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, all was dark; but there is no Conſequence in That; nor will it follow, becauſe Arts and Proſitable Inventions for the Affairs of this Life, grew up with the World; that Religion too was in its Infant Weakneſs and Ignorance in thoſe early Days. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> I am ſure, gives a very different account of the Matter;<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>1.</hi> in Matth.</note> He ſays, the Communications of God's Will were more liberal and frequent then; that Men lived in a ſort of familiar Acquaintance with him, and were perſonally inſtructed in Matters neceſſary and convenient; much better enabled to worſhip and ſerve him acceptably; and becauſe they did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Duty, and anſwer their Advantages, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from this Friendly way of converſing with Mankind; and then to prevent the utter Loſs of Truth, by the Wickedneſs and Weakneſs of Men, a Written Word was judged neceſſary; and That put into Books, which the Corruption of Manners had made unſafe, and would not permit to continue clear and legible, in Men's hearts. In the mean while the Preference he manifeſtly gives both for Knowledge and Purity, to the Firſt Ages; and compares the Patriarchs at the beginning of the World in this Point, to the Apoſtles at the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; as Parallels in the Advantages of Revelation, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wiſdom, infinitely ſuperior to the ſucceeding Times of the Church. And it is plain, from Scripture it ſelf, that <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> and other Perſons eminently pious, ſignally rewarded for it, and inſpired with God's own Spirit, were ſome of thoſe early Sacrificers. Perſons to whoſe Character the pretended Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Ignorance of the firſt Ages of the World, will very ill agree.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. There is, I muſt own, a Great Prejudice againſt this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution of Sacrifices, from the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the thing; it being urged, as a mighty Improbability, that ſo conſiderable an Ordinance, and One which grew ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53648:457"/>ſhould have no mention made of its firſt Command, and Eſtabliſhment; eſpecially, when ſo many things of ſeemingly leſs moment, are expreſly taken notice of; and by that means ſtrengthen the Opinion, which attributes a matter acknowledged on all hands to be of Conſequence, to ſome Original, other than Immediately Divine.</p>
                     <p>Now if we conſider the Deſign and Manner of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it will by no means appear ſtrange to us, that many things ſhould be omitted; This being I conceive intended chiefly to give a ſhort Account of the Creation and Fall of Man, the Promiſe of a Redeemer, and to draw down the Line of Deſcent to the Choſen Seed, from whence our Saviour ſprung, and the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Figure of the Chriſtian Church, derived themſelves. So that Their Hiſtory and Religion being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subject of the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we find very little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement upon Particulars till after the Call of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For if we conſider the Three firſt Chapters containing the Creation and Fall of our firſt Parents; the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and IX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> giving an Account of the Deluge, and Preſervation of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family; there remain but four more, before the Call of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and in thoſe the Succeſſion from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Poſterity for peopling the World, and the Occaſion of that Diſperſion, are contained. 'Tis true, ſome things are inſerted which to Us ſeem of leſs moment; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſome account may in reaſon be given, why they ſhould be mentioned, the Holy Spirit, who indited theſe Books, was the beſt Judge of That. But it is alſo true, that ſeveral other things as conſiderable as This are omitted likewiſe, which we do not upon that ſcore disbelieve; ſuch particularly, as Thoſe of Times ſtated, and Aſſemblies convened for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; and certainly it is as neceſſary and as important at leaſt to expect a Revelation for the Solemn Service of God, as for any particular Mode of Serving or Addreſſing to him.</p>
                     <p>I have now laid before my Reader the State of the Caſe, as They who alledge Human Invention for Sacrifices have put it; and in the Anſwer to thoſe Arguments, have given ſome for the Contrary Opinion. That the Authorities on that Side are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, is acknowledged; but the General Senſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church ſeems to incline to Divine Inſtitution. And the moſt reaſonable account of this Matter, if I apprehend it rightly, ſtands thus.</p>
                     <p>That Almighty God inſtructed <hi>Adam,</hi> how he would pleaſe to be worſhipped, and <hi>Adam</hi> trained his Family and Poſterity, both by Example and Inſtruction, in the ſame Solemn Methods of Serving and Addreſſing to God.</p>
                     <p>That from the Time of a Redeemer's being promiſed, Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifices were both inſtituted, and practiſed; partly as an
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53648:458"/>Intimation to Men of their own Guilt, and the final Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they deſerved; and partly as a Shadow and Prefiguration of that Vicarious Puniſhment, which God had promiſed to admit for the Sins of Men; in the Redemption of the World by the perfect Sacrifice of his Son.</p>
                     <p>That as no Age of the World can be inſtanc'd in, when God did not afford Men ſome viſible Signs, and Sacraments, of his Favour, and the Covenant between Him and Them; ſo the Ages before the Inſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, (which abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very expreſſive and particular Significations of this kind) had Sacrifices for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>That the Heathen Sacrifices were not pure Inventions of Men, but Corruptions of a Divine Inſtitution. Which being propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to all the Offipring of <hi>Adam,</hi> was differently received, and depraved by the Uncertainty of Tradition, long Tract of Time, the Artifice of the Devil, and Mens own Vicious Affections. Of which whoever reads the Apologies for Chriſtianity, will find Proofs in abundance: and be convinced that the Pagan Idolatry was built originally upon the Worſhip of the true God, vitiated and perverted and miſapplied. For we muſt in reaſon be ſenſible, that the likelieſt, and moſt uſual way, by which the Devil prevails upon Men, is not by empty and groundleſs Imaginations, or Inventions perfectly new; but by diſguiſing and mimicking the Truth, and raiſing erroneous and wicked Superſtructures upon a good and ſound Bottom.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore, it ſeems at leaſt in my poor Opinion, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies were indeed adapted to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and other Pagan Rites, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been acquainted with, and were not then in a Condition to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely weaned from. But withal, that thoſe Pagan Sacrifices were Corruptions of the old Patriarchal; not entirely mere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their own, but Additions only, and Extravagant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies of Error, to which the Truth and Poſitive Inſtitution of God firſt gave the hints and occaſions. For though it can very hardly be conceived how Sacrifices ſhould be of mere human Motion; yet there is no difficulty in ſuppoſing, that the Thing once Inſtituted, and once Eſtabliſhed, might be abuſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, to very prodigious and abominable purpoſes. As it was, no doubt, very early in that univerſal degeneracy to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from which it pleaſed God to reſcue <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>One very Remarkable Circumſtance contributing to the ſtrength of this Opinion is, that almoſt every where the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Act of Oblation, ſeem to be very much alike; which is very Natural to an Exerciſe and Inſtitution derived down from One common Head; and originally ſixed by a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Command; but ſcarce conceivable of an Invention merely
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53648:458"/>Human; where Men in all likelyhood would have run into as great Diverſity, and thought themſelves as much at Liberty as they do in the Affairs of Common Life. But eſpecially, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Beaſts by way of Atonement obtained univerſally, and the Imagination of Their Blood being neceſſary and effectual for Pardon. Which, I confeſs, if a Dictate of Reaſon and Nature only, is certainly the ſtrangeſt, and moſt remote from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conceptions we are able to form of the Dictates of Nature, of Any that ever yet prevailed in the World. And therefore This is ſcarce accountable for any other way, than from the Promiſe of a Redeemer and Sacrifice to come, which the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Beaſts were in the mean while appointed to repreſent.</p>
                     <p>That ſuch an Inſtitution agrees very well with all the Ends of Sacrifice, is not to be denied. For the Death of the Beaſt, though not perſonally felt by the Offender, would yet give him a full and very expreſſive Idea, of the fatal Conſequences of Sin; and the Acceptance of that Life, inſtead of his own which was forfeited, and by that Act of Sacrificing acknowledged ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Divine Juſtice, was a lively repreſentation of the Mercy of God. But ſtill the Apoſtles Argument is founded in Reaſon, and may be an Appeal to all Mankind, <hi>It is not poſſible, that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away Sin.</hi> And therefore not only <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his X<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Demonſtrat. Evang. Lib.</hi> I. aſcribes this Worſhip to Divine Inſpiration, but <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſays, that before the Law Juſt Men were inſtructed by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Inſtinct after what particular manner God would be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; as they were afterwards under the Law by External Precepts. So <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, That no Mortal Capacity can Know or Determine what is fit to be done in Holy Matters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbids the Alteration of the Eſtabliſhed Rites and Sacrifices as Impious. And the Teſtimonies of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        </note> have been thought to mean, not ſo much, that all Sacrifice was a Dictate of Nature, as that ſome Circumſtances relating to it were left to the Dictates of Man's Reaſon. So that when God had taught <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity, that they ſhould worſhip in their ſeveral Manners; and what he would pleaſe to accept; The Manner, and Meaſure, and ſuch like conſiderations were left to Choice, and Reaſon, and Poſitive Laws. In ſhort, the Religion of our Hearts and Wills, our Prayers and Praiſes might be natural and the reſult of meer Reaſon: but for other external Significations of this, eſpecially any ſo foreign, as that of Sacrificing; Men were not likely, nor was it fit they ſhould venture, to do any thing of their own Heads. Nor was it probable they would attempt it, for fear of miſtakes, and ſuch indecent Expreſſions, as might be very diſhonourable to the God they Worſhipped; and rather provoke his Juſtice by raſh and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Affronts, than incline his Mercy by their indiſcreet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53648:459"/>to pleaſe him. And therefore, conſidering the Confuſion <hi>Adam</hi> was in after the Fall, and the Circumſtances of that time, it ſeems moſt agreeable to believe, that he waited God's directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and was fully informed by Him in ſuch a Service, as might at once excite both the Fear and the Love of God; enforce the Offerer's Sorrow and Repentance, and increaſe his Faith and Hope.</p>
                     <p>While my Thoughts were upon this Subject, it came into my mind, that poſſibly the Tradition of a Redeemer to come, and that God would one day reconcile himſelf to the World by the Sacrifice of a Man, and his own Son: That this Tradition I ſay darkned, confounded, and perverted by the Increaſe of Idolatry, and the Cunning of the Devil, might be abuſed to the putting Men upon Humane Sacrifices, and particularly thoſe of their own Children. I know there are other accounts to be given of this matter; and I propoſe this as a meer Conjecture, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fit to trouble the Reader withal; but that, I believe, if ſtrict inquiry were made, it would be found, that moſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Abominations in Divine Worſhip were ſome way or other at a diſtance, by Miſtake, Imperfect Report, Perverſe Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or by ſome Cunning Stratagem of the Devil or other, fetched originally from the Revelations and Inſtitutions of the true Religion. And I cannot but think, that it would be great Service to the Truth, if the Falſhoods that have corrupted, and were ſet up in Oppoſition to it, could be well traced, and ſet in the beſt Light, which this diſtance will permit. But that muſt needs be a very laborious Undertaking, and, where a great deal will depend upon Probable Conjecture, will require a very Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious hand.</p>
                     <p>I have thus given the Reader my rough Thoughts upon the Point of Sacrifices, omitting ſuch Proofs for the Opinion I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to, as ſeem to me not concluſive, but not any that I am conſcious of, on the Other ſide. There is no danger in either Opinion, conſidered in it ſelf, but ill Inſinuations may be raiſed from that of Humane Invention; if Men from thence ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to draw Conſequences to the Prejudice of Natural Religion; and argue either againſt the Certainty of, or the Regard due to it; from an Imagination, that Extravagances ſo wicked, ſo odd, or ſo barbarous as the Heathen Rites of Worſhip, and the Wild Superſtitions and unbecoming Notions of God, upon which they were grounded, reſulted from Humane Nature, and were the Product of Reaſon: Rather than the Horrible Depravations of a Supernatural Inſtitution, highly proper and ſignificant, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to excellent purpoſes, and adapted to thoſe Ages of the World. And in hope of preventing any Conſequences of this kind it is, that I thought theſe Remarks might not be unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And for the Uſefulneſs, and Light which this Account of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53648:459"/>Sacrifices brings with it, provided we will follow it in its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequences; how wiſe an Inſtitution, how reaſonable to be incorporated into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, how providentially diſperſed over the whole World; and how preparatory of the Doctrine of the Redemption of Mankind, by prediſpoſing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo to believe the Sacrifice of Chriſt, my Reader may, if he pleaſe, be informed to his great Satisfaction, by that Short but Excellent Account of this Matter, given by Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the now Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> in his Second Sermon at Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Lecture for the Year 1695.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. After ſo long and particular Enlargement upon the Firſt of thoſe Things, wherein I endeavour to prevent any Miſtakes that may ariſe from this Paſſage; there will need but very little Addition to clear the Other. For if the Arguments for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution of Sacrifices caſt the Scale, the Buſineſs is already done to our hands: and if they be admitted of human Invention, yet according to all the Schemes of this Matter laid down by the Aſſerters of it, Sacrificers at firſt were moved by Apprehenſions of God very different from that of his taking Delight in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Creatures. For they Repreſent Sacrifices as the effects of Gratitude, a Mind impatient to make ſome ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and pay back ſuch Acknowledgments at leaſt of His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs who gave All, as the dedicating the Beſt of his Gifts to him could amount to. And accordingly, This Circumſtance of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Beſt for Sacrifice ſeems to have been as univerſally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Duty of Sacrificing it ſelf. This is the Reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by ſome for ſlaying Beaſts, as being the Beſt of all their Subſtance; and upon the ſame account too thoſe kinds which were eſteemed beſt for Food. This perhaps was one Motive abuſed afterwards even to the introducing that Abomination of ſacrificing Men, and Children; Virgins and Firſt-born. And even in Expiatory Sacrifices, could theſe poſſibly have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Men, yet 'tis plain the Perſuaſion of a Beaſt being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a Ranſom for the Owner, muſt include an Idea of Mercy and Condeſcenſion at leaſt in the Deity, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch a Compenſation.</p>
                     <p>It argued, I confeſs, very groſs Notions of God to ſuppoſe, that ſuch things could be Preſents fit for a Pure Spirit, and the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, which every Superior among Men would diſdain and deteſt. But This grew by degrees, and the Other, of his being a Sanguinary Being delighted with the Fumes of Reaking Altars, and drinking the Blood of Goats, was owing to the Superſtition and Idolatry of later and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Times; and is a Thought, which Thoſe who firſt practiſed this way of Worſhip, whether by Inſtruction, or their own mere Motion, were never ſuppoſed guilty of by any that have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to conſider the Nature and Original of the Patriarchal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:53648:460"/>
                     <p> Nay, I add too upon this occaſion, That the Notions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Chapter, which it is to be feared are but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly entertained of Severities, and Satisfactions (as they are called) owe themſelves to the ſame Cauſes, and are the Genuine Extract of Hypocriſy, Superſtition, and formal Devotion. That Faſtings, and voluntary Mortifications are of excellent Uſe in Religion, no ſober Man ever doubted. They are Proſitable in many Caſes, and in ſome Neceſſary. They aſſiſt us in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Appetites and Paſſions; and ſubdue the Man, by beating down the Outworks: They expreſs a very becoming Indignation againſt our ſelves, in the Exerciſe of Repentance; and are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inſtrumental in heightening and inflaming our Devotion: But that they are Good and Meritorious in themſelves, or any farther valuable than as they ſerve to promote our Improvement in ſome Virtues or Graces that are Subſtantially Good; eſpecially that God likes us the better merely becauſe we uſe our ſelves the worſe, is a very Fantaſtical and Erroneous Imagination: And ſuch as any Communion or Party of Men by Encouraging, do great Injury to the Honour of God, deceive the Souls of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and hinder the Eſſentials of Religion, which are Faith and Newneſs of Life. In ſhort, They expoſ: Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the ſcorn of all thoſe, who ſee the Foppery and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of thoſe miſtaken Methods; and call the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it into Queſtion, by tempting ſuch to think, that it is all Invention and Trick, and Empty Senſleſs Formality.</p>

                        </note> The Former of Theſe, is urged to be only a matter of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Neceſſity, the Fate of a Man, rather than his Choice; who if Adult, is brought over by Cuſtom and Multitudes; and if an Infant, is preſently initiated into the prevailing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of his Country, or his Family, and ſo continues all his Life long.</p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:53648:460"/>
                     <p> Now for Cuſtom, and Multitudes, and Example, it is very evident, This was much otherwiſe in the firſt Plantation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that of the Chriſtian in particular. A Perſuaſion, which, it is manifeſt, came into the World with all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages; and the Eſtabliſhment whereof was one of the moſt amazing Miracles, that ever was wrought ſince the Beginning of the World. For People had common Senſe then as well as now; and all the Corruptions of Human Nature were equally power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. There was the ſame Arrogance and Vain Opinion of their own Wiſdom, to render the Myſteries which are acknowledged above the Comprehenſion of a Human Mind, offenſive to the Men of ſome Learning and more Vanity: The ſame ſenſual Appetites and Vicious Practices to hold out and ſtand at defiance, againſt the Precepts of Chaſtity and Sobriety, Self-denial and Mortification: The ſame Pride and Opinion of Worldly Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to raiſe their Indignation and Diſdain of a Crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; The ſame Love of the World and Tenderneſs for their Perſons to prevent any raſh Sacrificing of their Lives and Eſtates for a Perſecuted Faith, when nothing was promiſed in Reward but a very diſtant Happineſs after Death. And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevail that Faith did; in deſpight of Human Oppoſition, and Intereſt; and prevail it could not have done, by any other means, than the Almighty Power of its Author and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and the Aſtoniſhing Effects which the Conviction of its Truth produced upon men's Conſciences. This certainly was Argument ſufficient, even to Demonſtration, that thoſe Words were not in any degree miſapplied, when put into the Mouth of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and its Preachers; <hi>Not of Man, neither by Man, nor of any other Creature, but of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſhall it be eſteemed any Prejudice to this Religion, that Men do not ſtill lie under the ſame Difficulties, in the Choice of it? When it hath made its own way triumphantly, and weatied out, or won over its Perſecutors, ſhall the Multitude of its Profeſſors, and the Peaceable and Eaſy Exerciſe of it be thought to derogate from its Authority? Sure it is very unreaſonable, that Faith ſhould be thought of Divine Extract, no longer than while it bids Men embrace it at their Peril. The being handed down in Families is a plain and natural Effect of an Eſtabliſhed Principle. Parents could not have the Affection which becomes their Character, did they not take all lawful and Commendable Methods of putting their Children into the ſame way to Heaven, which they truſt they are in themſelves. Eſpecially, if the Caſe lie between any other Perſuaſion, and <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> which we have reaſon to believe is the only poſſible Ordinary way thither. The entring Children early into Covenant with God is a very Profitable, and Charitable Cuſtom; what He himſelf not only admitted, but enjomed formerly; and ſince He is much more
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53648:461"/>eminently the Father of the Chriſtians, than of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we have no reaſon to ſuſpect they ſhall be leſs favourably received, when as early dedicated to him. This gives Security, that they ſhall be taught, when their Years enable them to learn, how they ought to believe and act; ſo that if their Religion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be merely the effect of Cuſtom and Example, This is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly beſide the Deſign of Thoſe early Initiations, where the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Contrary is poſitively indented for. If Men happen to be bred up in a wrong Perſuaſion, there is little Queſtion to be made, but great and gracious Allowances will be made for that faſt hold, which the Prepoſſeſſions of Education have taken. But be they in the right, or in the wrong, it is every One's duty, ſo far as his Opportunities and Capacity will give him leave to examine and ſee, that he may have comfort, and be better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Truth; or elſe retract his Error: Where This is not done, it is a neglect, and far from the intent of Truth; for Truth will bear Enquiry, and the more nicely ſhe is look'd into, the better ſhe is lik'd, the more admired, and triumphs, and reigns more abſolute. St. <hi>Peter</hi> poſitively commands, <hi>that we ſhould be ready to give a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. III. 15.</note> and though Men are more diſpoſed to conſider, when their Opinions are like to coſt them dear, yet the Reaſon of the Command is Univerſal, and by no means reſtrained to Times of Perſecution only. Every Man ſhould do his beſt to obey it, and every Perſuaſion ought to encourage it; and if any do not, but hide the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either by detaining the Scriptures, or not leaving Men to the Free Uſe of Modeſt and Impartial Reaſon, Theſe are the Men, who are moſt contrary to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and beſt deſerve the Cenſure of Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> in this Paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Second Inſinuation againſt the Divine Authority of Religion, is taken from the Viſible Inefficacy of it upon Men's Lives; as if all that came from God muſt needs be effectual for reforming the World. Now This, how popular and plauſible ſoever at firſt appearance, yet is an Argument of no Foundation or Strength at all. For the Short of the Matter lies here. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion never was intended to deſtroy Men's Nature, but only to mend it: to change Men indeed in their Affections and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſo as that this Change ſhould be wrought by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence it is, that though the Grace of God be Almighty, yet Man is not a proper Object for its Omnipotence to exert it ſelf upon. For ſhould he be forced even to his own Good, that Compulſion would not only take away the Merit of the Act, but the very Nature of the Perſon, whoſe very diſtinguiſhing Character, is Choice and Freedom of Conſent. And therefore God deals with us as he made us; he lets us want nothing, that we can enjoy the Benefit of, and continue Men; he inſtructs, ſuggeſts, perſuades, counſels, encourages, promiſes, threatens,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53648:461"/>puts opportunities into our hands, and gives us a power of uſing them; but it will depend upon our ſelves at laſt, whether theſe ſhall have a good effect or not. We can do no good without Him; but neither will He do it without Us, nor indeed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent Scheme and Conſtitution of Things, is it at all conceivable how he can. So that the Actions of Men not anſwering the Efficacy which might be expected from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of an Almighty God, is no Argument againſt thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples coming from Him, which are not better obeyed; becauſe this is not a Caſe for him to exert his Almighty Power in: And though he wrought many Miracles formerly for the Conſirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth by virtue of that power; yet we never find, that he ever uſed that power for the foreing a belief of thoſe Miracles; but Men were left to their own Conſideration and Liberty, what Interpretation they would make of them; and as they determined themſelves, Belief or more Obſtinate Infidelity was the Effect of it.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it true, that Wicked Men do not believe Religion; It is but too ſure, that they endeavour as much as they can not to believe it, when Matters are come to that paſs, that the Belief of it grows uneaſy to them. It is indeed confeſs'd, that our Perſuaſion is the very Spring upon which all our Actions move. But then there muſt a diſtinction be made between the Habit and the Act of Faith. For a Man may entertain an Opinion, and yet do ſome things contrary to it, becauſe that Opinion may not in the inſtant of Action occur to him; and then, as to all effect indeed, it is the ſame, as if he thought it not. Thus a Man may believe Chriſtianity, but through the Strength of Paſſion, through the Surprize or Violence of a Temptation, through Raſhneſs or Incogitancy, Multitude and Intricacy of Buſineſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Affection of the World, or the like he may not attend to what he believes, or he may not conſider it ſufficiently, or not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Future its due weight, when ſet againſt the Preſent. Now though ſuch a Perſon, as to all the purpoſes of doing well, be <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc,</hi> as an Infidel; yet there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Him in the general, and One who does not believe at all. This Man, though he does not act in conſiſtence with himſelf, hath yet a dormant Habit, which, when the Paroxyſm is off, the Temptation removed, the Paſſion abated, or the like, may by Recollection, and Sober Senſe be awakened; and then it will at leaſt check him for what is paſt, and may (till he hath ſinned himſelf paſt feeling) be a conſiderable Reſtraint upon him. But the Other hath nothing to inform, nothing to controul him: And though a Man in ſleep may appear to the Standers by to be dead, yet we know what difference there is in the thing it ſelf. This I take to be a ſufficient Account of even good Men's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning often, and ſome Bad Men doing it very ſcandalouſly, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53648:462"/>yet retaining the Faith; which if purſued through all its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and applied cloſely and warmly to their Conſciences, would ſhew them the abominable Contradiction they live in to their own Minds, and make them quite another ſort of perſons.</p>
                     <p>From hence I ſuppoſe the Reader will naturally draw to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf theſe following Reflections.
<list>
                           <item>1. That Men are not wrought upon by Things as they are in themſelves, but by their own Apprehenſions of them. They act by the dictates of their own Minds, and as they are perſuaded. It is not the Happineſs of Heaven, or the Miſery of Hell, that excites to any one Good, or affrights from any one Evil Action, in their own Nature; but the Idea, and as I conceive of them. And conſequently, in proportion as I deſire the One, and dread the Other, ſuch will my Care be to practiſe, or to decline thoſe things, to which the Promiſes and Threatnings of God are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</item>
                           <item>2. That to make this Perſuaſion effectual, it is neceſſary it ſhould be preſent to the Mind. For that which is not preſent at the time of Action, is to all effect for that time as if it were not. This ſhews the Neceſſity of Meditation, and much Thought upon the Principles of, and Motives to Religion; ſince Faith will not, cannot work, by barely being aſſented to; but by being vigorouſly and lively impreſt upon the Conſcience, warm, and ready upon every new Aſſault. And this gives us a very Rational Account, how it is poſſible, and why it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for a Man to entertain all the Principles of a true Faith, and upon Premeditation be able to ſay as much for it as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nay, to perſuade himſelf as well as others, that he is a very ſincere Believer; and yet lead a Life very contrary to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. For this proceeds from his thinking a hearty Aſſent to the Truth of a Doctrine ſufficient; and it is ſo indeed, to denominate him a Profeſſor; whereas to make him a Good Man, that Aſſent ſignifies little, unleſs it be followed, and frequently inculcated, ſo as to ſeaſon his Mind throughly, and upon all occaſions to be at hand, and vigorous and freſh; for without Theſe qualities, it can never be a Principle of Action.</item>
                           <item>3. That conſequently the Inconſiſtence of Men's Lives with their Profeſſion, can be no juſt Objection againſt Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fault plainly lies not in the Principles, but in Men's neglect to improve them. And when we would be convinced of the Goodneſs of any Perſuaſion, we are to judge the <hi>Tree by its Fruits;</hi> (not the Faith by the Practices it produces actually in Men's Lives, as that Expreſſion is frequently miſapplied, but) by the Good Actions it would produce, if Men would let it have a due influence upon them, follow it as far as it will carry them, and live up to what they profeſs. The Men who do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are very blameable, and lay a ſtumbling-block before the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53648:462"/>weak, by briging diſhonour upon Religion, and tempting them to ſuſpect its Power and Excellence; But it is only the Weak who ſtumble at it; for there is not, nor ever was in the Affairs of Religion, or of any other kind, any Scheme of Rules or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, where all the perſons who made Profeſſion of them, acted in all points accordingly. And at this rate all manner of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Virtue, Natural, as well as Acquired, and Revealed, muſt be queſtioned, and exploded; and the very firſt Dictates of Human Nature will not eſcape the ſame Fate. Of ſuch Eternal Equity and Truth is that old Axiom, <hi>Fides non è Perſonis, ſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà.</hi> And the Chriſtian Faith will ſufficiently clear its own Divine Original, if we will but give it free Courſe, and ſuffer it to draw us to a Reſemblance of that Excellence, which firſt Inſpired and taught it.</item>

                     <p>Although the Anſwers to theſe Pretences uſually alledged in favour of Self-murder be in a great meaſure taken off in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Section; and the Determination at laſt be ſound and good; yet in regard thoſe Returns are general, and do not reach every Particular; I will ſo far treſpaſs upon the Reader's Patience, as to run over this part of the Argument, Period by Period, as freſh Matter ariſes; and obſerve to him, what hath been, or may very reaſonably be replied upon each of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes produced here, (for I rather call them Excuſes than Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications) to give Countenance to that Unnatural Act of Self-murder.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is urged that there are great Examples for it in all Story, and of Perſons of all Perſuaſions, particularly, thoſe of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53648:463"/>
                        <hi>Razias</hi> and the Women under the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and <hi>Pelagia</hi> and <hi>Sophronia</hi> among the Chriſtians; the Former drowning her ſelf to eſcape the Rudeneſs of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the Latter ſtabbing her ſelf to get free from the Luſt of <hi>Maxentius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here in the firſt place I obſerve by the way. That Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in General is a very inſufficient and deceitful Rule; nor can we always make any ſure Concluſions of the Lawfulneſs or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of a Fact, by the Relation given of it. Becauſe many times the Thing is commended with regard to One Part or Circumſtance, and yet not thereby juſtified as to all the reſt; This, I ſay, when there is a Commendation poſitively added to it; but many, if not moſt, are barely related, and left for Us to interpret, without any Character at all fixed upon them. Nay, I add farther, that the Circumſtances of Perſon, Time, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others of the like nature, are ſo infinitely different that, as it is exceeding hard for Us, who are not perfectly acquainted with the Reaſons and Motives upon which others act, to paſs an exact and true Judgment upon their Actions; ſo is it much more difficult to find Inſtances, where Their Circumſtances and Ours ſhall agree ſo nicely and in every Particular, that we ſhall deſerve juſt the ſame Commendation, or Blame, which they did, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating their Proceedings. Thus much was not amiſs to be hinted, concerning the Fallacy of Examples in general, and how very unfit they are to be made a Rule for the Behaviour of other People. I ſhall now touch briefly, upon each of the Particulars above-mentioned</p>
                     <p>As for That of <hi>Razias</hi> It is indeed delivered after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as ſeems to carry a Commendation with it, but this is only a Commendation of his Valour, and Heroick Greatneſs of Soul; not of the Virtue of the Action, or any thing which might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Imitable by others. St <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Reflection upon it is, <hi>Dictum eſt quod elegerit nobiliter mori;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>xxiii.</hi> contra <hi>2.</hi> Epiſt. Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> 
                        <hi>meliùs vellet humiliter, ſic enim utiliter. Illis autem verbis hiſtoria Gentium laudare conſuevit, ſed viros forte hujus ſeculi, non Martyres Chriſti. His Character</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is, That he choſe to dye Nobly; it had been much better if the Commendation had been, that he choſe to dye Modeſtly and Humbly; for This had been a profitable way of Dying. But thoſe are Pompous Terms, uſual in Prophane Story, ſuch as are counted an Honour to the Men of this World, but not to Martyrs for Chriſt.</hi> The Account in the <hi>Maccabecs</hi> expreſſes his reſolute Deteſtation of Idolatry, and that is commendable; but certainly had he been taken, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Torments and Death under <hi>Nicanor,</hi> his Praiſe had been much more juſt, and his Character clear and indiſputable. For even Perſecution it ſelf is not a Reaſon ſufficient for our making this Eſcape; according to that of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Jonah: Non eſt noſtrum Mortem arriperc, ſed illatam ab alijs
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53648:463"/>libenter excipere. Under &amp; in perſecutionibus non licet propriâ perire manu. It is not our buſineſs to bring death upon our ſelves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Mac.</hi> xiv. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it willingly, when inflicted by Others; and for this Reaſon even the Caſe of Perſecution will not warrant a Man's dying by his own hand.</hi> But in truth, <hi>Razias</hi> his Caſe, as the Hiſtorian deſcribes it, was none of this; for his Account at the 42<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Verſe is very Remarkable. <hi>He fell upon his ſword, chuſing rather to dye manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abuſed otherwiſe than beſeemed his Noble Birth.</hi> So that <hi>Razias</hi> at this rate was what the World vainly calls a Man of Honour, and his Life was ſacrificed to that Principle: Had he done this Act to avoid offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, it had had a fairer Pretence at leaſt, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would That have excuſed it; but to kill himſelf for fear of Indignities, and Affronts not fit for a Man of his Quality to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to; this was far from a Religious Principle; and we cannot wonder that the Commendation it receives hath given ſo ſtrong a Prejudice to the Church againſt the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> as not to admit it into their Canon of Scripture. I add too upon this occaſion, that ſome have thought this whole matter a Fiction;<note place="margin">Spanhem. de Author. Lib. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryph. in Diſp. Theol. <hi>V. 41. 43. 44. 45. 46.</hi>
                        </note> and I confeſs the Circumſtances are very Odd and Romantick; That a Man ſhould <hi>fall upon his Sword</hi> firſt; then <hi>leap down from a Wall into the midſt of his Enemies;</hi> That they <hi>ſhould make way for him,</hi> where he <hi>fell among the thickeſt of</hi> them; that he ſhould riſe up again in <hi>anger, but withal in ſuch a Condition, that his blood guſhed out like Spouts of Water,</hi> and his Wounds were very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; but he <hi>ran through the midſt of the throng</hi> notwithſtanding, and <hi>ſtanding upon a ſteep rock, When his blood was now quite gone,</hi> he <hi>pluck'd out his bowels, took them in</hi> both <hi>his hands, caſt them upon the Crowd;</hi> and yet for all this, his Senſes it ſeems were not loſt at the laſt Gaſp, but after all thoſe wonderful Exploits this was not the leaſt wonderful, that he ſhould have the Uſe of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſo perfect, as to call upon God to reſtore him thoſe Bowels again; and ſo dye. This I thought not amiſs to hint; and let them look both to the Truth of the Story, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Commendition, who have entitled theſe Books to an equal Authority with the Scriptures of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
                     <p>That Inſtance of the Women under the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> I do not underſtand, for if it refer to thoſe mentioned, 2 <hi>Macc.</hi> VI. 10. they ſeem to have been thrown headlong from the Wall, by the hands of Executioners. But if they had done it themſelves, their Caſe had been ſomewhat more Pitiable, but not more Imitable, than that of <hi>Razias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe of <hi>Pelagia</hi> and <hi>Sophronia</hi> are indeed extolied, but yet St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who in one place makes the preſerving of Chaſtity an Exception, and the only reſerved Caſe from what I quoted out
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53648:464"/>of him juſt now againſt Dying by one's own hand in Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſays in another place without exception.<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Marc.</note> That <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no Souls who come without his orders. Deus non recipit Animas, quae ſe nolente exterunt è corpore.</hi> And whether this Caſe of Theirs was a Call, notwithſtanding the Advocates and Applauſes they have found, is greatly to be queſtioned. For what is the Chaſtity God requires? Is it not that of the Mind? Could not God have reſtrained even thoſe laſcivious Intentions? Does not <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the very ſame Chapter, wherein he relates this Act of <hi>Sophronia</hi> delivering her ſelf from <hi>Maxentius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Hist.</hi> L VIII. Ch. XIV.</note> particularly tell of a Chriſtian Lady at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who not being any way to be conquered by <hi>Maximin,</hi> he would not ſo much as Kill her for her obſtinacy, nor indeed Force her Perſon, but in the Conflict of Rage and Luſt, at laſt only Confiſcated her Goods, and ſent her into Baniſhment? But ſuppoſing God had permitted the ſoul Act; yet ſo long as the Mind was unblemiſhed, here had been no Guilt, but rather a double Martyrdom. If you ſay, they might poſſibly ſuſpect, that they ſhould in the Commiſſion of the Fact, have been polluted with ſinful Inclinations. 'Tis eaſy to Anſwer, That this is but a Fear, but a bare Poſſibility; and if an Act be, Otherwiſe, and in the general, Unlawful, the bare avoiding a poſſible Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it lawful to break a Command, and by going againſt God and Nature,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X. 13. 2 Cor. XII.</note> commit and chuſe a certain Sin. He has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>That he will not ſuffer his Servants to be tempted, above that they are able,</hi> and declared that <hi>our Weakneſs can never be ſo great, but that his grace is ſufficient for us;</hi> with many other gracious Promiſes, which it is a great fault in us to diſtruſt, even in our greateſt Straits and Neceſſities. And to deliver our ſelves by Methods, contrary to his Laws, is to diſtruſt them, for we are to expect the Aſſiſtance of his Grace, and the Protection of his Providence in the uſe of thoſe Means, and obſervance of thoſe Rules he hath given us. And therefore I cannot conceive how the fear of falling into Sin only, can poſſibly render that Action Lawful, which otherwiſe, and generally ſpeaking, is it ſelf a Sin and Unlawful. Methinks therefore we ſhould do well in this Caſe to diſtinguiſh with our Saviour in the Parable of the Unjuſt Steward; and as he commended the Wiſdom of that Man, without approving his Injuſtice; ſo we may allow all poſſible Praiſe to the Gallantry, and Conſtancy of theſe Female Martyrs; without allowing, that the Courſe they took to preſerve their Virtue,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>1.</hi> Front.

                        </note> was ſtrictly regular and good. And thus St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> ſeems to have done, who, notwithſtanding the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium given of <hi>Pelagia</hi> in one place, yet ſpeaks of this Act of dying by one's own hand in very ſevere Terms in another; and declares without exception, that the Chriſtians had all ſuch Perſons in abhorrence; and that they were more guilty before God than any other murderers. And ſome of thoſe Inſtances,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53648:464"/>which were thought hard to condemn, the Vindicators have not well known how to acquit, otherwiſe than by a preſumption of a particular Impulſe of God, which was for that Time and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Diſpenſation to the General Law. So St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> of <hi>Sampſon, Spiritus latenter hoc juſſerat, qui per illum miracula faciebat. The ſame Spirit which wrought Miracles by him, gave him a Secret Command to do this thing.</hi> And <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſpeaking of theſe very Women ſays, <hi>Monitum aut Juſſio Dei hîc quoque praeſumenda;</hi>

                        </note> That a Command, or at leaſt ſome Inſtinct and Direction from God, is to be preſumed in their Caſe, as well as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s; and he had St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s own Authority, he ſays, for this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All which, when duly conſidered, as it will not warrant us to cenſure theſe Perſons as to their Eternal State, ſo neither will it warrant our Imitating ſuch Actions, or arguing from thence in defence of ſuch Behaviour, or for the Extenuating the Sin of Self-murther. For whatever they might be in Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis ſure they are no Pattern to Us; and if God ſee ſit to Allow, or the Church to Commend their Zeal, it will ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us to obſerve, and beware of the Irregularities of it.</p>
                     <p>The Examples which follow of Cities, deſtroying themſelves rather than they would lie at the Mercy of the Conquerors, whatever appearance they may have of Fortitude and Gallantry, yet as to the point of Conſcience, and Lawfulneſs, they are certainly blameable, and fall under the ſame Cenſure, which is afterwards given of <hi>Cato,</hi> and others <hi>Page</hi> 294. <hi>N.</hi> 3, 4.</p>

                        </note> where Perſons willing to Dye made no ſcruple of doing it, having firſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Judgment and Approbation of the Senate, and by Poiſon kept on purpoſe, and prepared at the Publick Charge, is only a Permiſſion and Allowance, and does by no means take off the Guilt and Injuſtice of making our ſelves a way; except only in that ſingle Point, that here the Publick is not injured, having expreſly conſented to the loſs of that Member. But in all other reſpects the Fact was Wicked and Abominable, and is reported to have had no other foundation, than Affliction, or Extreme old Age, or in general a Wearineſs of Life.</p>
                     <p>Nor will the next Argument hold, concerning the Deſire of Death; for ſuppoſing, that whatſoever a Man is allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, he is likewiſe allowed to procure to himſelf, (which yet is not univerſally true) yet this Deſire it ſelf is faulty, when it grows into Impatience, and is not content to wait God's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and God's leiſure. And there is great difference between meeting Death gladly, and running into it; between receiving our Releaſe with Satisfaction, and breaking Priſon. So far therefore as this Deſire is conſiſtent with Patience, and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Divine Will, ſo far it is truly Magnanimous and Commendable, and no farther.</p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53648:465"/>
                     <p> To that Queſtion, What Law does this offend againſt, it is eaſy to anſwer, Againſt the Laws of God, and of Nature, againſt the Condition of Mankind, againſt our Duty to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; againſt the Sixth Commandment in particular, which no more argues us Guiltleſs when we Kill our Selves, becauſe chiefly deſigned to reſtrain us from Killing Others; than it can be proved from the Seventh, that we do not Sin againſt our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when we Invade another's Bed. The Love of our ſelves is propoſed as the ſtandard of our Love to others; and the Rule muſt be ſuppoſed as perfect at leaſt, as the thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by it. If there be no Prohibition againſt this in expreſs words, it was becauſe none was thought needful; and ſure it is no excuſe to ſay, That no Law is violated in Terms, When the Caſe was ſuch as needed no Law. As to the other part of the Argument, That Men may diſpoſe of themſelves as they pleaſe, and a willing Perſon can receive no Injury; it ſuppoſes an Abſolute Right to diſpoſe of our ſelves, ſuch as no Creature hath with reſpect to God and Providence, and no Man can have with regard to the ſeveral Relations and Dependencies in which he is engaged.</p>
                     <p>And if ſo little can be ſaid for this Horrid Fact, when the moſt favourable Caſes are put; How deteſtable and impious muſt it needs be, when Diſgrace, or Poverty, Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and Croſſes, Raging Paſſions, and Repining at Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, prevail with Men to commit it? For theſe are ſuch Motives as no body ever undertook to juſtify, and the Stoicks themſelves, who went the fartheſt in this matter, yet ſtopp'd ſhort of theſe, and, to ſpeak the Truth, even wavered in all the reſt.

Where this is wanting, there can be no ſuch thing as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Beauty, Propriety or Decency. It is the very Salt of Life, the Luſtre and Ornament of all our Actions; That which recommends them to the Eye, and gives them that Seaſoning and Reliſh which is neceſſary; 'Tis the Square and Rule, by which all our Affairs ought to be meaſured and adjuſted; and, in one Word, This is the Art of Acting and Living, as the Science of Phyſick is the Art of Health.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Prudence conſiſts in the Knowledge and the Choice of thoſe things, <note place="margin">Definition.</note> which it concerns us to deſire or to decline: It is a juſt and true Valuation firſt, and then a picking and culling out the beſt: It is the Eye that ſees every thing, and conducts our Motions and Steps accordingly. The Parts or Offices of it are Three, and theſe all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſequent, and in order after one another. The Firſt is Conſulting and Deliberating well; the Second, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reſolving well; the Third, Managing and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting thoſe Reſolutions well.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53648:466"/>of Actions and Accidents belonging to Humane Life are within its Extent and Juriſdiction; and This, not only conſidering them in the groſs, but each of them ſingly and in particular; So that This is as infinite, as all thoſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals put together.</p>

                              <hi>That whatever is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, exceeds the Bounds of Wiſdom.</hi> But that which adds yet more to the Hardſhip, is the great Uncertainty and Inconſtancy of Human Affairs; which is ſtill rendred more intricate and unaccountable, by the inexpreſſible Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Accidents, Circumſtances, Appurtenances, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and Conſequences; the Difference of Times, and Places, and Perſons. And each of theſe is of ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Importance, that the Change of one ſingle Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even ſuch as may ſeem leaſt and of no account, produces a very great Alteration, and ſets quite another Face upon the whole Matter. This Difficulty is likewiſe greater and more evident, upon account of the Office, in which this Virtue is employ'd; which conſiſts in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering together Contraries, and then tempering them in juſt proportions with one another, ſo as to qualifie the whole at laſt, in the beſt manner the Caſe will admit. Another part of this Office, is Diſtinguiſhing aright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things that are like, and making a wiſe Choice by diſcerning Real from Seeming Good, and preferring a Greater to a Leſs of the ſame Kind. Now all theſe things are puzzling, and full of Confuſion; for Contrariety and Reſemblance both agree in this, that either of them is a great Impediment, and creates Doubt and Irreſolution.</p>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53648:467"/>too, that it is as criminal to enquire into them, as it is impoſſible to ſatisfie our ſelves by ſuch Enquiry.<note n="*" place="bottom">Occultat corum ſemina Deus, &amp; plerunque benerum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorumque cauſa ſub diverſa ſpecielatent.</note> 
                              <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath thought fit to conceal the Seeds of theſe things; and it often happens, that the Cauſes of Good and Bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects lie hid, and diſguiſe themſelves under very different Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</hi> And beſides all this, there is that ſtrange Turn of Chance, that unaccountable Fatality, (call it what you pleaſe) that Supreme, Secret, Unknown Power, which always maintains its Authority, and gives the finiſhing ſtroke, in deſpight of all the propereſt Methods, and wiſeſt Precautions we can uſe. From hence it comes to paſs, that the beſt-laid Deſigns, and moſt regular Proceedings, are very frequently moſt unfortunate in the Event. The very ſame Courſe taken by One Man ſucceeds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his heart's Deſire; and with Another croſſes all his Expectations; and yet the Caſe to all Human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is the ſame in both, and no reaſon can be given for ſuch contrary Iſſues. Nay, the ſame Man found thoſe very Methods ſucceſsful yeſterday, which, when he tries again to day, baffle all his Deſigns and Dependencies; and he who was a Winner but juſt now, plays the ſame Game over twice, and the ſecond time loſes all. This Lottery of Fortune gave juſt occaſion for that received Rule, That no Man's Counſel, or Capacity, can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſured by his Succeſs. And He was certainly in the right, who told ſome of his Friends, that ſtood ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his ill Fortune, when they obſerved a more than common Wiſdom in all his Diſcourſe and Behaviour: <q>Look you, Gentlemen, this does not mortifie me at all; I am Maſter of my Methods, and capable of judging what is proper and convenient; but Events are what no Man alive can govern, or inſure to himſelf:</q> This is Fortune's doing, which ſeems to take a kind of envious Joy, in defeating our ſubtleſt Projects, and diverts her ſelf with our Diſappointments; She in an inſtant blaſts our Hopes, and overturns the moſt regular Schemes, which have coſt the Study and Care of many Years to draw and deſign; and when all the matter is duly conſider'd and reſolv'd; when we have advanced ſo far, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains but the laſt Act; when all is brought
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53648:467"/>to Bear, (as we call it) ſhe nails up all our Cannon, and puts a full ſtop to all the Execution we intended. And in truth, This is the only way Fortune takes to make her ſelf great, and maintain her Credit in the World; thus ſhe exerts her Power over the Affairs of Humane Life; or, to ſpeak more truly, and in language more beſitting the mouth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 'Tis Thus, that Providence takes down our Pride and mortifies our Preſumption: Fools cannot be made Wiſe by Chance and of a ſudden; but then, to check the Vanity of thoſe who have the advantage in Parts, They are frequently ſucceſsful, even to a degree that may provoke the Envy of Virtue and Wiſdom it ſelf. Accordingly we may often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Perſons of very indifferent Capacities, and ſmall Attainments, have been able to accompliſh vaſt Undertakings, both publick and private; while others of more Maſterly Judgments have been defeated in matters of leſs difficulty. From all which Reflections my Reader plainly perceives, that Prudence is a boundleſs and a bottomleſs Sea; never to be limited by poſitive Preceps, or reduced to certain and ſtanding Rules; becauſe the Subject it is concerned with is fickle and inconſtant, like the Sea too; and all our Meaſures muſt be changed, all are liable to be broke, as oft as the Winds change. One croſs Blaſt blows us back again, or daſhes us to pieces upon the Rocks; and neither the beſt Veſſel, nor the beſt Pilot can be proof againſt this Streſs of Weather. All then, that Prudence can engage for, is to be circumſpect, and conſider every Circumſtance in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lights it is capable of; but ſtill the moſt diſcerning Man is in the Clouds; The greateſt Judgment and Application finds all its Endeavours frivolous and vain, and that, when he thought he ſaw all things clearly, he was all the while grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and blundering in the dark.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And yet, notwithſtanding we cannot arrive to a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and infallible Certainty, <note place="margin">Neceſſary.</note> this Virtue muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of exceeding great weight, and abſolute Neceſſity. For thus much is her juſt due; that what is poſſible to be effected muſt be compaſs'd by her aſſiſtance; that though ſhe cannot do All, ſhe can do a great deal; and that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men are not conſtantly ſucceſsful with her, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her all their Attempts are frivolous and perfectly inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant. Not only Riches, but Power, and Opportunities, and Strength for Action, are impotent and vain, if deſtitute of Wiſdom to uſe them.</p>

                              <hi>Many things that Nature hath made intricate and difficult, are made eaſie and very feaſible by good Conſideration and Advice.</hi> Nor does what I urged in the former Paragraph at all invalidate the Truth of theſe Obſervations; becauſe, though Prudence be not the never-failing Cauſe, yet it is the uſual Cauſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. God does not always proſper Mens wiſeſt Projects; To convince us, that the World is not govern'd without him: But he for the moſt part proſpers fit and proper means, to encourage our Induſtry, and as a proof, that the World is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned regularly by him. Now That, which principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Our Prudence, is, that we have to do with Men, and the corrupt Diſpoſition of the Perſons we deal with, their perverſe unmanageable Temper, makes Addreſs neceſſary in all our Tranſactions. For of all Creatures in the Univerſe, there is not any ſo hard to be ſubdued and brought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, as Mankind;<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <hi>They who cannot bear ſo much as Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Neighbours fare, muſt needs be much leſs contented with Subjection and Slavery.</hi> And thefore nothing leſs than great Art and Induſtry is ſufficient to reduce and keep them in order. For though we are always diſpoſed to mutiny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that are in any reſpect our Superiors, and to fall ſoul upon People of all Conditions; yet we never do it with ſo much Zeal, and ſuch eager Malice, as when we make Head againſt thoſe who pretend to Authority and Dominion over us. Now Prudence is the knack of managing Mankind, and keeping this Factious Principle under; a ſlack and gentle Rein, by which the Skilful Rider keeps this Skittiſh Horſe in the Road, and Ring of Obedience.</p>
                           <p>Now, although Nature have implanted this, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues in us, and more or leſs, in proportion to every Man's Capacity and Parts; and, though it be from thoſe Original Seeds, that Prudence takes its beginning; yet is
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53648:468"/>this more acquired, more learned and improved, more the Effect of Study and Application of Thought, than any other Virtue whatſoever. And this Acquiſition is in ſome meaſure the Fruit of wiſe Precepts, and good Advice; which we commonly call the Theory or Speculative Part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but the beſt and Principal Inſtrument and Help toward it, is Experience, (though this require much more Time, and Pains) which is term'd therefore the Practical Part. And This again is of Two ſorts. The One truly and properly ſo, becauſe it is Perſonal, learnt by what happens to, or is done by our own ſelves; ariſing from Obſervations of our own making; and to This in ſtrict ſpeaking the Name of <hi>Experience</hi> is appropriated; The Other is not our own, but the reſult of other Peoples Judgment or Practice; and ſuch is <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which informs us by Hearſay and Reading. Now our own Proper Experience is much the firmer, more aſſur'd, and what may with better reaſon be depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, <hi>is the beſt Maſter,</hi> the Author and Teacher of all Arts and Sciences; the perfecteſt, though the moſt tedious and expenſive way of Learning<note n="*" place="bottom">—Seris venit Uſus ab Annis.</note>; it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of many Years and Gray Hairs, exceeding hard to be maſtered, very laborious, and very rare. The Knowledge of Hiſtory, as it is leſs ſatisfactory and aſſured, ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe more eaſie, more frequently to be met with, more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and in common to all ſorts of People. A Man indeed is more reſolute and confident, when he learns Wiſdom at his own Coſt; but it is much eaſier and cheaper to grow wiſe at the Expence of other People. And from theſe Two. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience properly ſo call'd, and Hiſtorical, Prudence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd; according to that common Saying,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                                 <l>Uſus me genuit, peperit Memoria,</l>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Now Prudence may, and in order to the giving us a clear Notion of the thing, 'tis neceſſary it ſhould, be diſtinguiſhed in ſeveral Reſpects; both with regard to the Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the uſe of it, and the Affairs, about which it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. As to the Perſons, we are to obſerve, That there is firſt That which we may call private Prudence; and that is either ſolitary and individual, wherein a Mans ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53648:469"/>only is concern'd; this is ſomething ſo low and narrow, that it ſcarce deſerves the noble Title of Prudence; or elſe it is Social and Domeſtick, confin'd to ſome ſmall Company, and leſſer Societies; and then there is Secondly, Publick Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is commonly known by the Name of Policy. This is the more Sublime, more Excellent and Uſeful, and more difficult to be attained; and to This it is, that all thoſe lofty Characters and large Commendations in the beginning of this Chapter do of right belong; which is again ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided according to the different Subjects and Occaſions that call for it, into Civil, and Military Prudence.</p>
                           <p>With regard to the Affairs it is converſant about, Theſe are of two kinds; Some Ordinary and Eaſie; Others Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and Uncommon. There are alſo ſeveral Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by the interpoſition of which ſome new difficulties ſpring up, which were not in the nature of the things; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doubts and perplexities not foreſeen at the firſt ſetting out; and accordingly that Prudence, whoſe buſineſs it is to manage all theſe, may be termed either Ordinary, when it proceeds in the plain eaſie way, and governs its ſelf by known Rules, eſtabliſhed Laws, and Cuſtoms in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe; or elſe Extraordinary, when it is obliged to go out of the beaten Road, and have recourſe to difficult Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and unuſual Methods.</p>
                           <p>There is ſtill one Diſtinction more behind, which extends both to the Perſons, and to the Affairs; or, as the Schools ſpeak, the Subject and the Object of this Prudence. But it is ſuch a one, as regards not ſo much the ſeveral Kinds, as the different Degrees of this Virtue. I mean that Prudence, which is truly and properly a Man's Own, and gives him the Denomination of Wife; when one acts upon his own Judgment, and trades with his own Stock; the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Borrowed and Precarious Prudence, when we follow the Advice of others. And thus it is, that all Philoſophers agree in allowing two ſorts of Wiſe Men. The Firſt and Higheſt rank, are thoſe, who walk by their own Light, that penetrate and ſee through all Difficulties, and always contrive Remedies and Expedients, by the force of their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and happy Forecaſt. But where ſhall we find theſe Able Men? They are certainly Prodigies in Nature. The Other of Inferior Condition are ſuch, as underſtand how to judge, and take, and make the beſt advantage of good Counſel, when it is given them. Now all Perſons whatſoever, that make any manner of pretence to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53648:469"/>Wiſdom, muſt be included in this Diviſion; for They who neither know how to give good Advice, nor how to take it when others give it, are by no means fit to come under this Character, but the contrary of Stupidity and Folly.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The General Rules, which concern Prudence at large, in it's moſt comprehenſive Signification, as it relates to Perſons and Affairs of all Sorts and Qualities, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled, and ſome ſhort account given of them in the Book that went before. And thoſe you remember were Eight. Firſt, The true underſtanding of the Perſons and Buſineſs we are engaged with. Secondly, Eſtimating things according to their real worth. Thirdly, The chooſing in conſequence of ſuch Valuation. Fourthly, Asking Advice upon every Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, Fifthly, A juſt Temper between the two Vicious Extremes of Confidence and Making ſure of all on the one hand, and Fear and Deſpondency on the other. Sixthly, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things in their due ſeaſon, and laying hold on Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, when they offer. Seventhly, Managing one's ſelf rightly between Induſtry and Fortune, aſcribing to each the Efficacy that belongs to it, and diſcharging Our part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The Eighth and Laſt is, Diſcretion in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and ordering of all the reſt; for this muſt go quite through, and no one part can be what it ought without it. Theſe were ſufficient for my purpoſe at that time, but now I am engaged in another Method; and the deſign of this Third Part cannot be anſwer'd, without deſcending to Particulars. Here therefore I ſhall treat of Prudence according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions juſt now ſpecified; and Firſt of All, of that which is Publick, or Policy, as it relates to Perſons, and then as it concerns the Affairs, that come under its Care.</p>

Their Tranſactions and Methods are indeed in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited, Difficult to be known and practiſed, and the Rules neceſſary for their high Station, next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53648:470"/>to be caſt into any certain Form, or preſcribed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in particular Precepts. But however, we muſt try, if we can a little clear this matter, and make it in any degree more eaſie and practicable. What is proper to be ſaid upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be reduc'd to two General Heads, wherein the two Great Duties of a Sovereign conſiſt. The Firſt comprehends under it all thoſe principal Pillars, by which the State is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and treats of Parts of Governments: ſo eſſential to the Publick, that they are the very Nerves and Bones of this Body Politick; its Senſe, its Motion, its Form is loſt with, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by them; and theſe the Prince is in a ſpecial manner concerned to take care, that Himſelf and the State be conſtantly well furniſhed with. The Chief of them, I think, are theſe Seven: 1. A true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of his Government, the People, and their Conſtitution. 2. Perſonal Virtue. 3. Behaviour and Addreſs. 4. Counſellors. 5. Publick Treaſures. 6. Men and Arms. And 7. Alliances. The Three firſt are in his own Perſon; the Next in himſelf and thoſe near his Perſon; and the Three laſt are more at a diſtance from him. The Second General Head conſiſts in Action; in carefully employing, and making the beſt Advantage of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Means; that is, in one Word, but that a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive one, in Governing well, and keeping up his Honour and Authority; yet ſo, as at the ſame time to ſecure the Affection and good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding both of his own Subjects and ſtrangers. But to ſpeak more diſtinctly and particularly, this Part is Twofold, Civil and Military. Thus you have in a very ſummary and general way the whole Scheme of Government laid before you at once; Thus is the Work cut out, and the firſt rude Lines drawn, of what the following Chapters muſt attempt to finiſh and fill up. For the better Convenience then of the Reader and my ſelf, I will according to what hath been here propos'd, divide this Subject of Policy, or Prudence in Government into Two parts. The Firſt ſhal be the Proviſionary Part, or the Care of being furniſh'd with theſe ſeven Neceſſary Advantages; The Second, and That which preſuppoſes the former already to be done, ſhall be the Adminiſtration, or Management of the Prince. This Subject hath indeed had great Right done to it by <hi>Lipſius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; who wrote an excellent Treatiſe, in a method peculiar to himſelf, but the Subſtance of it you will find all tranſplanted hither. I have not at all bound my ſelf to his Order, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this general Diviſion already laid down, and will more plainly be ſeen in the following parts of this Diſcourſe; nor have I taken the whole of him; but have left part of what was his behind, and added to it what I thought fit beſides.</p>

                                    <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Firſt Branch of Policy, or Prudence in Government, which is the Proviſionary Part.</head>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE Firſt thing requiſite upon this occaſion, <note place="margin">Knowledge.</note> and That which muſt lead the way to all the reſt, is a due Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the State or Government: For in all manner of Prudence, the leading Rule is Knowledge; and he, who is defective in this Qualification, is thereby rendred utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all beſides, as hath already been intimated in the Second Book. For, whoever undertakes any ſort of Action or Management, muſt begin with informing himſelf, what his Buſineſs is, and with whom it lies. And therefore this Prudence, which undertakes to order and diſpoſe whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms; and whoſe peculiar Excellence and Commendation lies in the dexterity and skill of Governing and Adminiſtring the Affairs of the Publick to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, is manifeſtly a Relative Virtue; and the Terms of this Relation, whoſe Concern in this caſe is reciprocal, are the Sovereign and his Subjects: The firſt ſtep then toward diſcharging this Duty, is a right underſtanding of the Parties; that is, of the People and their Subjection on the one hand; and the Supreme Authority of the Prince on the other; for both theſe I include in the Knowledge of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                                 <p>Firſt then, A Man in that elevated Poſt ſhould apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Study and underſtand the Humour and Complexion of the People. For this Knowledge will be a very great direction, and model the Perſon, to whoſe Governance they are committed. What the Diſpoſition of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is in general, hath been at large explain'd in the Firſt Book, and their Picture drawn at full length. There we obſerv'd that their Reigning Qualities are, Fickleneſs and Inconſtancy; A Spirit of Faction and Diſcontent; of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence and Folly; Love of Vanity and Change; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and inſupportable Pride in Proſperity; Cowardice and Dejection of Mind in Adverſity. But beſides theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, which are common to Perſons of that Condition every where, a Man muſt be ſtill more particularly inſtructed in the Temper and Complexion of that Country, and thoſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53648:471"/>Subjects, where himſelf is concern'd. For the Diſpoſitions of Men differ extremely, and are almoſt as various as the Towns wherein they dwell, or the Perſons that inhabit them. Some Nations are in a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing manner, Paſſionate or Cholerick, Bold and Warlike, Cowardly or Luxurious, addicted to Extravagance, to Wine, to Women; Laborious or Slothful; Frugal or Expenſive. And of thoſe, who agree in theſe Qualities, there is a difference in the meaſure; in Some they are more, and in Others leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. So neceſſary is that Rule,<note n="*" place="bottom">Noſcenda Natura Vulgi, &amp; quibus modis temperanter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatur.</note> 
                                    <hi>That The Common People muſt be Studied, firſt to know what they are, and then what is the beſt method of dealing with them.</hi> And in this Senſe it is, that we are to underſtand the Old Philoſophers; when they pronounce Subjection and Obedience a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preparation to the Art of Ruling;<note n="†" place="bottom">Nemo bene imperat, niſi qui ante paruerit imperio.</note> 
                                    <hi>No Man</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>ever Governs well, who hathnot firſt liv'd under Government, and known what it is to be Commanded himſelf.</hi> Not that we are to infer from hence any Neceſſity, or indeed ſo much as a Poſſibility, that all Princes ought to be rais'd to that Dignity from an Inferior Condition; for ſeveral of them are born Princes; and a Great many Governments paſs on in a Line, and come by Succeſſion, and Proximity in Blood: But the true Importance of that Maxim is, That whoever is deſirous to be a good Governor, muſt inform himſelf of the Humors and Inclinations of his Subjects, and underſtand, which are the reigning Qualities inthem, as perfectly well, as if He had been one of the ſame Rank himſelf, and had felt and been acted by them in his own Perſon.</p>
                                 <p>But then it is no leſs neceſſary, that the Condition of the Government ſhould be likewiſe thoroughly underſtood; and that not only What Sovereignty and Power is in general, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſcription formerly given of it in the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe; but the Frame and Temper of that Government and that State in particular, where this Perſon himſelf preſides, what the Form and Conſtitution of it is, how it was ſix'd and adjuſted, and what Extent of Power is veſted in him; Whether it be an Old or Later Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether it deſcend by Inheritance, or whether it be conferred by Election; whether it were obtain'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53648:471"/>and Legal Methods, or whether acquired by Force of Arms; how far his Juriſdiction reaches; what Neighbours are about him; what Strength and what Conveniences he is provided with. For according to theſe, and a great many other Circumſtances, too tedious to be ſpecificed here, a different ſort of Conduct will be found neceſſary. The Scepter muſt be ſwayed, as ſuch Conſiderations ſhall dictate; One and the ſame Method will not ſerve all alike; but the Rules and the Adminiſtration muſt be ſuited to the Temper of the Beaſt, and as this proves to be harder or ſofter mouth'd, ſo the Rider muſt take care to keep a ſlacker or a ſtiffer Rein. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                                 <p>After this Knowledge of the State and Government,<note place="margin">The ſecond Head. Virtue.</note> which as I ſaid, is in the Nature of a Preface, or Indroduction to all the following Heads, the next both in Order and Dignity is Virtue. And no Man can wonder that ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Place is aſſign'd to This, among the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualifications of a Governour, who at all conſiders, how abſolutely and indiſpenſably needful it is to a Prince, and that, both upon his own Account, and for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Publick. Firſt of all, it is highly reaſonable, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> well obſerves, That he, who is above all the reſt in Honour and Authority, ſhould be ſo in Goodneſs too; This is no more, than what ſuch a Great and Elevated Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may juſtly ſeem to require of him. Then his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is nearly concerned in it; For Common Fame makes it one great part of its Buſineſs to pick up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe every thing that our Governours do or ſay: The Prince ſtands expoſed to the publick View; every Eye is upon him, and he is curiouſly watched. There is no ſuch thing in Nature, as Privacy for Princes; They can no more be conceal'd, than the Sun in the Firmament. They are the conſtant Subject of Diſcourſe in every Company; and ſo are ſure to have a great deal of Good, or a great deal of Ill ſaid of them. And it is of exceeding great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to any Governour; both with regard to his Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Common Intereſt and ſafety, what Opinion the World have of him. Nor is it enough, that the Supreme Governour be Virtuous in his own Temper and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he is likewiſe oblig'd to take good care, that his Subjects be like him in Goodneſs. And how deeply This concerns him, I appeal to the Univerſal Conſent of all Good and Learned Men, who with one Voice declare it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for that Kingdom, or Nation, that City or leſs
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53648:472"/>Society of Men to proſper, nay, ſo much as to ſubſiſt long, who have baniſhed Virtue from among them. And thoſe nauſeous Flatterers prevaricated much too groſsly, who pretend that it is for the Advantage and Security of Princes, that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be abandon'd to Wickedneſs and Vice: Becauſe ſay they, This emaſculates their Minds, and renders them more tame and ſervile intheir Diſpoſitions; ſo <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Panegyrick, ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Patientiores ſervitutis, quos and decet niſi eſſe ſervos.</note> 
                                    <hi>They are more patient under Slavery, who are fit for nothing but to be Slaves.</hi> For, quite contrary, we find by unqueſtionable Experience, that the more Vicious Men are, the more do they flinch, and grow unruly under the York: The Good and the Gentle, the Meek and Sweet-temper'd Men, theſe are much better qualified to live in Fear and Awe of Authority themſelves; than to be an Awe or give occaſion of Jealouſie to their Governours.<note n="†" place="bottom">Peſſimus quiſque aſperrime Rectorem patitur: Contrà. Facile Imperium in Bonos, qui Metuentes magis quam metuendi.</note> 
                                    <hi>Every Man is more ungovernable, in proportion, as he is a worſe Man,</hi> ſays <hi>Saluſt:</hi> Mutiny, and Diſcontent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Uneaſineſs, are the ſure Attendants of a profligate Mind. <hi>On the other hand, Good Men are very eaſily kept in order; they give their Superiours little trouble, but had rather ſubmit with Reverence and Fear, than be a Terror or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to thoſe above them.</hi> Now there cannot be a more powerful Motive, a more efficacious Mean of bringing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the People, and forming them into Virtue, than the Example of the Prince. For (as daily Experience ſhews,) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one affects to be like Him; and the Court is the Standard of Manners, as well as of Faſhions. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe Example is what Men are ſooner moved, and more ſtrongly wrought upon by, than Laws; for this is a Law in dumb Show, but hath more Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than the Voice of the Law ſpeaking in Commands.<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Nec tam Imperio nobis opus quam Exemplo; &amp; mitius ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur Exemplo.</note> 
                                    <hi>We do not want Precepts ſo much as Patterns, and Example is the ſofteſt and leaſt invidious way of Commanding;</hi> ſays <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Now, if all Example be a mighty Inducement, That of Great Perſons muſt be ſo in a Degree proportionable to their Quality and Station: For all the Little Ones fix their Eyes and Hearts here, and take their Obſervations from thoſe above them. They ſwallow all without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53648:472"/>admire and imitate at a venture; and conclude, that their Superiours would not be guilty of any Behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming their Character; and if They do a thing, it muſt needs be excellent and good. And on the other hand, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are ſo ſenſible of the Force of this Motive too, that they think their Subjects indiſpenſably obliged to thoſe Rules which they are content to be governed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and that their own doing what they would have done by others, is ſingly a ſufficient Inducement, to bring it into Practice and common Vogue, without the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Command to enforce it. From all which it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly manifeſt, that Virtue is exceeding neceſſary and advantageous to a Prince, both in point of Intereſt, and in point of Honour and Reputation.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> All Virtue is ſo in truth, without Exception, though not All equally neither; for there are four Species of it,<note place="margin">Four Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> which ſeem to have greater and more commanding Influence, than the reſt; and thoſe are <hi>Piety, Juſtice, Valour</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</hi> Theſe are more properly Princely Qualities, and ſhine brighteſt of all the Jewels that adorn a Crown; of the Excellencies, I mean, that even a Prince's Mind can be poſſibly endued with. This gave occaſion to that moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious of all Princes, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> to ſay, That Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juſtice exalt Kings, and tranſlate them into Gods: And <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves, that Clemency is a Virtue more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Character of a Prince, than to perſons of any other Quality whatſoever.</p>
                                 <p>Now the Piety of a Prince conſiſts and muſt exert it ſelf in the Care and Application, which he ought to uſe for the Preſervation and Advancement of Religion, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sovereign ought to conſider himſelf, as the Guardian and Protector. And thus indeed he ſhould do for his own ſake; for this Zeal and pious Care will contribute very much to his own Honour and Safety. For they that have any regard for God, will not dare to attempt, no not ſo much as to contrive or imagine, any Miſchief againſt that Prince who is God's Image upon Earth; and who plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves himſelf to be ſuch, by his zealous and tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Glory and the Inſtitution of his great Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. And in effect, this tends no the Security of the People too, and the Quiet of the Government in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. For, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> frequently urges, Religion is the common Band, that links Communities together; Society could not be ſupported without it. Take off this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53648:473"/>and the World would immediately be overrun with all manner of Wickedneſs, Barbarity and Brutality. So great an Intereſt hath every Government in Religion; ſo ſtrong, ſo neceſſary a Curb is the Senſe, and Fear, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of it to unruly Mankind. Thus on the other hand, even <hi>Cicero,</hi> who does not appear to have been any mighty Devote, makes it his Obſervation, That the <hi>Romans</hi> owed the Riſe, and Growth, and flouriſhing Condition of their Commonwealth, to their Exemplary Reſpect for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more than to any other Cauſe whatſoever. Upon this account, every Sovereign is very highly concerned, and ſtrictly oblig'd to ſee, that Religion be preſerv'd entire, and that no Breaches be made upon it: That it be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd and ſupported, according to the eſtabliſh'd Laws, in all its Rights, Ceremonies, Uſages, and Local Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Great Diligence ſhould be uſed to prevent Quarrels, Diviſions, and Innovations; and ſevere Puniſhments inflicted upon all who go about to alter, or diſturb, or infringe it. For, without all Controverſie, every Injury done to Religion, and all raſh and bold Alterations in it, draw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them a very conſiderable damage to the Civil State; weaken the Government,<note place="margin">Dion.</note> and have a general ill Influence upon Prince and People both; as <hi>Moecenas</hi> very excellently argues, in his Oration to <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Next after Piety, Juſtice is of greateſt Conſequence and Neceſſity;<note place="margin">Juſtice and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> without which Governments are but ſo many Sets of <hi>Banditi,</hi> Robbers, and Invaders of the Rights of their Brethren.

How mean ſoever the Party, or how ſlight ſoever the Occaſion be, ſtill this Word muſt be Sacred. When he hath thus provided for his own Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, his next Care is, to ſee that others are Juſt too. For This indeed is the Fundamental Article of all Government, the very End of its Inſtitution, and the particular Truſt put into the Hands of every Sovereign.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53648:474"/>Juſtice be equally diſtributed, and Wrongs and Oppreſſions repreſs'd, by interpoſing his Arbitration and the Power of the Sword.

                                 <p>One thing, by the way, ought not to be omitted upon this Occaſion; which is, that the Juſtice, and Virtue, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of a Prince is not in all Points ty'd up to the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and manner of Proceeding with that of Perſons in a private Capacity. It hath a larger Range, and freer Scope allow'd; and all this Latitude is Indulgence little enough; no more than is abſolutely neceſſary for the Weighty and Hazardous Office our Governours are engag'd in, and the Infinite Unconceivable Difficulties that ariſe in their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. This makes it reaſonable for Them to go in a Way by Themſelves; the common and direct Tract is too Narrow; they are oblig'd to ſhift, and dodge, and wheel about, and whatever Cenſures People, who underſtand not the Nature of the Caſe, may paſs, as if every thing that is unuſual and indirect, were preſently Wicked and Unjuſt; yet thoſe, who are capable of conſidering, and competent Judges of the Matter, muſt admit it to be lawful and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53648:474"/>as well as prudent and needful for them to do. For Prudence muſt be mix'd with Juſtice; ſome Feints and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and little Slights made uſe of; and (as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs it) when the Lion's Skin is not big enough of it ſelf, it muſt be eked out, by tacking a Fox-Skin to it.</p>
                                 <p>Nor would I be ſo miſtaken here neither,<note n="*" place="bottom">Salus Populi Supreme Lex eſto.</note> as to be thought a Juſtifier of theſe crafty Dealings at all times, and in all Caſes indifferently. By no means, This is not a ſtanding Rule of Action; But muſt be reſerv'd for ſpecial Occaſions; and particularly, there muſt be three Conditions to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it. The firſt is abſolute Neceſſity, or at leaſt, ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and very conſiderable Advantage to the Publick (that is, to the Prince and the State, who are to be look'd upon as One and the Same, and their Intereſts altogether inſeparable) and this muſt by all means be conſulted, and made the chief Aim. This is a natural, an indiſpenſable Obligation: For the Publick Good is a Conſideration Paramount to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the Man that is procuring it, cannot but be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Duty.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <note n="*" place="bottom">Salus Populi Supreme Lex eſto.</note>
                                    <hi>The Safety of the People muſt be the Supreme Law.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The Second Qualification which theſe Methods muſt have to recommend them, nay indeed to acquit them of Blame, is, That they be uſed Defenſively, only and not Offenſively; with a Deſign to preſerve a Prince or a State, but not to aggrandize Them, and oppreſs Others. For this Reaſon they ſhould ſeldom or never be begun with, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again; and then are they in proper time and Place, when employ'd to ſave the Publick from Snares and Subtle Deſigns, and not to contrive, but to diſcover and defear miſchievous and ſicked Practices. For one Trick may be anſwered with another; and it is reaſonable to play the Fox with a Fox. The World is exceeding full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Cunning: And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Obſervation is moſt true, That the Subverſion of States and Kingdoms is uſually ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Treachery and Deceit. What then ſhould hinder? what forbid? Nay, in ſuch Exigencies, what can excuſe the Conſervators of the Publick Safety, from preventing and diſappointing ſuch Calamities and Villainous Intentions by countermining? Why may not the State ſave it ſelf
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53648:475"/>by the ſame Methods that were practis'd to ruine it, and retort the Artifice of Factions and Wicked Male-contents back upon their own Heads? For a Man to be too Squeamiſh in theſe Caſes; to play conſtantly above-board and upon the ſquare; and deal with theſe Men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of that Rigorous Equity and Plain-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which Reaſon and Conſcience require from us in private Affairs, is inconſiſtent with the Nature and the Meaſures, nay, with the very End of all Government; and the Event would often be the betraying and loſing all, and Sacrificing the Publick to an Unreaſonable Scruple.</p>
                                 <p>The Third Qualification is, That theſe Methods be uſed moderately and diſcreetly; As they are not fit for all Times, nor all Occaſions; ſo neither are all Perſons ſit to be truſted with them. For they are capable of great Abuſes: And if abuſed, will prove of ill Example and ill Conſequence by miniſtring Occaſion to ill Men, to practiſe and juſtifie their Frauds and indirect Dealings, and ſo giving Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Wickedneſs and Injuſtice, even in private Commerce and Tranſactions: For a Man is never at Liberty to forſake Virtue and Honeſty, to follow Vice and Injuſtice; Theſe things are ſo far from indifferent, that there is no Poſſibility of reconciling thoſe diſtant Extremes, no Satisfaction capable of being made for ſo ill a Choice. And therefore away with all Injuſtice and Infidelity, all Treacherous and Illegal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and curſed be the Principles and the Politicks of thoſe Men, who (as I inſtanc'd before) would poſſeſs Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commanders with a Belief that all things are lawful, if they be but expedient for them. There is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſuch an Arbitrary Notion of Right and Wrong, and the Rules and Limitations I have here laid down. Reaſons of State may ſometimes make it neceſſary to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Honeſty with Profit, and try if theſe two can be ſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together as to make a good Compoſition. But, tho' we may try to compound and ſoften the Matter, yet we muſt never act in oppoſition to Juſtice. We may, nay, we muſt ſometimes uſe Artifice and Subtilty; we may ſometimes wheel off a little, and fetch a Compaſs about it; but we muſt never loſe Sight of it, much leſs turn our Backs upon it, and caſt all Regard for ſo Sacred a Thing behind us. For there is a Cunning very conſiſtent with Virtue and ſtrict Honour, ſuch as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great calls <hi>a Great and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Cunning, (Magna &amp; laud tbilis Aſtutia)</hi> ſuch as tends to Good; and may be uſed, as Mothers and Phyſicians deal
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53648:475"/>by their Children and their Patients, when they tell them fine Stories to amuſe and entertain them, and by degrees cheat them into Health. In ſhort, many things may be tranſacted ſecretly and in the dark, which are not ſit for publick View, and will not bear an opener Proceſs; Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Stratagem may be added to Courage and Strength. Art and Wit may ſupply the Defects of Nature and Force, in caſes which theſe are not ſufficient to manage: A Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may, nay, he ought to be, as <hi>Pindar</hi> calls it, a Lion in the Field, and a Fox at the Council-Table; or, as that Divine Saviour, who was Truth it ſelf, hath expreſt himſelf upon another occaſion; He may be a ſubtle Serpent, but ſtill a harmleſs Dove.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> To ſay ſomewhat of this Matter more particularly, and give the Reader a diſtinct Notion,<note place="margin">Diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others.</note> what ſort of Subtlety I mean. I ſay that Diſtruſt, and the keeping himſelf much upon the Reſerve, is highly requiſite in a Prince; and this is to be done, without abandoning Virtue and Equity. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, which is the former of theſe two Qualifications, is abſolutely neceſſary; as indeed its contrary, Credulity, and Eaſineſs, and raſh Confidence, is a very great Fault, and of moſt dangerous Conſequence to a Prince: For his Station obliges him to Vigilance; he is accountable for the whole Community, and therefore no Faults of his own can be light and inconſiderable; and where every Action hath ſo mighty effect, ſuch univerſal Influence, great Care ſhould be taken, and every thing done adviſedly. If he be of a confiding Temper, he diſcovers his Intentions, and lays himſelf open to Shame and Reproach, and a world of Dangers;<note n="*" place="bottom">Opportunus Injuriae. <hi>Senec.</hi> Aditum nocendi Perfido prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat Fides.</note> 
                                    <hi>He lays himſelf in the way of being ill uſed;</hi> nay, he even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and tempts treacherous and deceitful People to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe upon him; and gives them a power to do a World of Miſchief, with very little danger, and great Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Advantage to themſelves. Knaves have always the Inclination to be falſe; and truſting them gives them Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of gratifying that Inclination to our Prejudice. A Prince ſhould always retreat behind this Shield of Diffidence; as ſome of the Philoſophers have ſtiled it, who repreſent it as a very conſiderable Branch of practical Wiſdom, the very Nerves and Sinews, that impart Strength and Motion: That
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53648:476"/>Diffidence, I mean, which conſiſts in keeping ones Eyes open, ones Mind in ſuſpence, ſuſpecting and providing againſt every thing. And for all this, he will not need any more convincing Reaſon, any ſtronger Inducement, than barely the reflections upon the Temper and Condition of the World would give him. To obſerve, how all Mankind are made up of Falſhood and Deceit, of Tricks and Lies; how Unfaithful and Dangerous, how full of Diſguiſe and Deſign all Converſation is at preſent become, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, how much more it abounds near his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and how manifeſtly Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation are the reigning Qualities of Prince's Courts, and Great Men's Families, above any other places whatſoever. A King therefore muſt be ſure to truſt but Few, but very Few; and thoſe ſhould always be ſuch, as long Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and many Tryals have given him a perfect Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and good Aſſurance of. And even theſe moſt intimate Confidents muſt be conſulted with ſo diſcreetly, that he never commit himſelf entirely, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to them; he muſt not give them all the Rope, but conſtantly keep one End in his own Hand; and how long a Range ſoever he think ſit to allow them, yet it will be very neceſſary to have an Eye always upon their Motions. But yet at the ſame time, this very Diſtruſt muſt be concealed, and diſſembled too; and in the very midſt of his Reſerves, a Prince muſt put on the Air of Openneſs and Friendſhip, and appear to repoſe a mighty Confidence in thoſe about him. For nothing is more provoking and offenſive, than plainly to ſee one s ſelf ſuſpected; and this Diſtance and Jealouſie is ſometimes as ſtrong a Temptation to Treachery and ſoul Play, as too ſupine and free a Confidence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Multi fallere docuerunt timentes falli. <hi>Sen.</hi>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> From that Diſtruct ſprings Diſſimulation; which is a Branch of the ſame Stock:<note place="margin">Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For were there no ſuch thing as Diffidence and Reſerve, but Frankneſs and Fidelity, and Good Aſſurance every-where, there would be no place left for Diſſembling; whoſe Buſineſs it is to open the Face, but cover the Heart; and while one's outward Air ſeems to unlock all, to keep the Thoughts and Intentions cloſe and unſeen. Now the ſame Diſſimulation, which in Perſons of private Condition would be vicious and abominable, is in Princes highly commendable; there is no diſcharging their weighty Affairs without it; and the very thing which ruins common Converſation, is the beſt Security, and neceſſary ſupport of Government. Feints and Pretences are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite, not in Military Conduct only, and time of War, to amuſe Enemies and Strangers, but even in Peace and Civil Adminiſtration towards one's own Subjects; tho' upon ſuch Occaſions, I confeſs, they ought to be practiſed more ſparingly and nicely. The plain, and free, and open, ſuch as we commonly ſay carry their Heart in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are by no means cut out for the Buſineſs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they often ruine and betray both themſelves and their People. And yet, as was obſerved in the former Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, ſo here again, this Diſſimulation requires ſome Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and Skill. It is not every one whoſe Temper will let him diſſemble, that is Maſter of this Art; for unleſs the Part be play'd well, it is abſolutely ſpoil'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore care muſt be taken of Over-doing, and Unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and aukward improper Carriage: For This is eaſily ſeen through, and then you loſe your End. For to what purpoſe do you hide and diſguiſe your ſelf, if the Mask be ſo plain, that every Body can diſtinguiſh, and ſee you put it
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53648:477"/>on? And how vain are all Pretences and little Artifices, when the Secret is once out, and the Deſign hath taken Air? Their very Nature then is changed, and they ceaſe from thenceforward to be Artifices any more. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit for a Prince to pretend to Simplicity and Sincerity, the better to cover his Addreſs of this kind; and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to court, and careſs, and commend Men of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Tempers and free Carriage, and all that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Enemies to Diſſimulation; nay, it is expedient for him, in matters of leſs Conſequence, to act ſo, and gain the Reputation of ſuch a one himſelf, that ſo he may be more at liberty to uſe Art and Reſerve in Affairs of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be ſafe from Jealouſie when he does ſo; under the ſhelter of a contrary Character.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> What hath hit herto been exemplify'd, is chiefly on the Omitting ſide;<note place="margin">Secret Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> and the Exerciſe of it conſiſts not ſo much in Action, as in forbearing, and ſeeming not to act. But ſome Occaſions require a great deal more; and therefore a Prince muſt be qualify'd for bolder Strokes, and advance to actual Deceit; of which there are Two ſorts neceſſary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and ſometimes to be practiſed.</p>
                                 <p>The Firſt is That of ſetling a private Correſpondence, and getting Intelligence underhand: The engaging the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Services of Officers, Attendants, Counſellors, and Confidents to Foreign Princes; or, if occaſion be, contriving to have ſecret Information, not only how one's Enemies, or Brother-Kings, but even one's own Subjects behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and what Deſigns are brewing. This is a ſort of Subtlety much in requeſt, and every where made uſe of, between one Prince and another; and <hi>Tully</hi> recommends it as a very conſiderable Point of Prudence. Sometimes this is effected by the power of Perſuaſion only; but, generally ſpeaking, there aremore ſenſible and moving Arguments made uſe of, than bare Words can pretend to; Preſents, I mean, and Penſions; whoſe Force is ſo irreſiſtible, that not only Secretaries of State, Preſidents of Councils, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friends, and intimate Favourites, have by this means been prevailed upon to communicate, and ſo prevent and defeat the Deſigns of the Maſter, whoſe Bread they eat, and to whoſe Countenance and Bounty they owe all their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not only Commanders have aſſiſted their Enemies in time of Action; but, which is ſtill more prodigious, and proves the Almighty Power of Bribery, to the Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of treacherous corrupt Nature, even Wives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53648:477"/>have been hired to diſcover the Secrets, and betray the ſafety of their own Husbands. Now this corrupting the Confidents of others, is what a great many make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At leaſt he finds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to give Countenance to what his Convenience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades; and that which hath divided Men's Judgments, and made it a moot Point, he thinks will be ſufficient for his Vindication. Abundance of Caſes of this nature might be ſpecify'd; but at preſent I ſhall content my ſelf with a few,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53648:478"/>that now occur to me, and leave it to the Reader, to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like, or parallel to theſe, as he ſees fit.</p>
                                 <p>What ſhall we ſay firſt to the ridding ones Hands of a troubleſome peſtilent Fellow, that propagates Faction and</p>
                                 <p>Diſorder, and is eternally breaking the publick Peace, by getting him taken off ſecretly, without any legal Proceſs? This Man, take notice, is ſuppoſed to deſerve Death, but the Circumſtances of the Offender, and of the Prince, are ſuch, that without manifeſt Danger to the State, he cannot be brought to Juſtice, nor made an Example in the common way. Here is, they tell you, no material Injuſtice in all This; the Offender hath but his Due; and, as Matters ſtand, the Publick is better ſerved by his having it in this way, than it could be, by puniſhing him after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other Offenders of the like Nature. So that the moſt you can make of this, is a Breach of the Forms and Methods preſcribed by Law; and ſurely, they tell you, the Sovereign Prince is above Forms.</p>
                                 <p>The next is Clipping the Wings, and giving a Check to the Wealth and Power of ſome Great Man, who is growing Popular, and ſtrengthening his Intereſt; and both from his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Inclination to do Miſchief, becomes formidable to his Prince. The Queſtion here is, whether a Prince may not lower and cut ſuch a potent Subject ſhort in time, without ſtaying ſo long for a fair Provocation, that he ſtall be grown too big to be dealt with; and if any Attempts be made, either againſt the publick Peace in general, or the Life of the Prince in particular, it will not then be poſſible to prevent or to puniſh them, though we would never ſo fain.</p>
                                 <p>Another is, In an extreme Exigence, and when no other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies are to be had, ſeizing upon private Stocks, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling ſoe of the wealthieſt Subjects to furniſh the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Neceſſities, when the Nation is not able by all its Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Funds to ſupport it ſelf.</p>
                                 <p>A Fourth is Infringing and Vacating ſome of the Rights and Privileges which ſome of the Subjects enjoy, when the Authority of the Prince is prejudiced and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Grandeur eclipſed by the Continuance of them.</p>
                                 <p>The Laſt is, a Point of Prevention, when a Fort, or a Town, or a Province very commodious to the Government is ſeiz'd, and got into a Prince's Hands by interpoſing firſt; and to keep it out of the Poſſeſſion of ſome other powerful and very formidable Neighbour; who by making himſelf Maſter of this Paſs, would have been in a Condition of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53648:479"/>doing great Injury, and giving perpetual Diſturbance to this Prince and his Country, who are now the firſt Occupiers.</p>
                                 <p>All theſe things, I know, ſound harſh, and are hardly, if at all, to be reconciled with the common Notions of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Matters of State are neither fit nor ſafe for me to give a Judgment in; thus much only, I think, may not misbecome this place to ſay, That, as on the one hand the indulging and having frequent recourſe to ſuch Actions is very dangerous, gives juſt matter of Jealouſie to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and will be apt to degenerate into Tyranny and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant uſe of Power; ſo on the other, it is plain, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to be modeſt and very ſpring in cenſuring the Actions of their Prince, and the Steps he makes for the publick Safety, however bold they may ſeem, and beyond the Lengths which are commonly gone. And this ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt of our Judgments in matters of another and very diſtant Sphere, will appear the more reaſonable, when I have ſhewed you that very eminent Men, Perſons of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Virtue as well as vaſt Learning and Wiſdom, have approved all thoſe Practiſes already mention'd, and think them not amiſs, provided the Succeſs be good, and anſwer their Intentions. And to this purpoſe I will quote you here ſome of thoſe Sentences and Remarks which they have left us upon ſuch Occaſions.</p>

                                 <p>Thus much however, I preſume to add, that let theſe Actions of theirs find never ſo favourable Interpretations, never ſo juſt Allowances; yet for their own Juſtification, and the ſoftening asmuch as may be, the Odium of ſuch irregular Proceedings: There is not only a Neceſſity that they ſhould be reſerved for the laſt Extremities, but that when Princes are perfectly driven to make uſe of them, they ſhould go about it with a real unwillingneſs and great Regret. They ſhould look upon This neceſſity to which they are reduced, as a very particular Misfortune, and Mark of an angry Providence; and all their Behaviour and Reſentments upon ſuch Occaſions, muſt be like thoſe of tender Parents, when, ſore againſt their Will, a beloved Child is to have a Limb ſear'd, or cut off; Methods which nothing but the hope of ſaving his Life by this only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, could ever prevail with them to ſubmit to; or as a Man in extremity of Pain goes about the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tooth, when nothing elſe will eaſe or aſſwage the Anguiſh. And now I have related the Opinions of very eminent Philoſophers and Politicians, and obſerved what Abatements they are content to make for Caſes of neceſſity; I muſt once more ſolemnly avow, that as for any Paſſages, or Politick Maxims, which pretend to greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, ſuch as ſet a Prince above all Conſideration of Law or Juſtice, that make Profit and Greatneſs the only End worthy
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53648:480"/>his proſecuting; and either place Advantage upon the Level with Honeſty, or ſet it higher, every Good Man muſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them; and every good Governour will be ſo far from taking his meaſures according to this Standard, that he will reject them with Deteſtation and Diſdain.</p>
                                 <p>I have inſiſted ſo much the longer upon this Branch of a Prince's Virtue; becauſe of the many Difficulties and Doubts, which ariſe upon this Point of Juſtice; the regular Exerciſe and Adminiſtration whereof muſt needs be very much interrupted and perplexed by the infinite Emergencies, the ſudden and extraordinary Changes, and the Neceſſities that the publick happens to be involv'd in.

This moderates, manages, and ſweetens all; it ſpurs the Guilty, relieves the Poor an dejected, and reſcues thoſe that are ready to periſh. Clemency in the Ruler anſwers to Humanity in common Men; it is contrary to Cruelty and exceſs of Rigour, but not to Juſtice; for with this it is very reconcilable, and all its Care is to ſoften, and to moderate its Determinations.

There is ſomething in Fear, which is even deſtructive of Duty, if it be not tempered, and kept within Bounds by Lenity and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if turn'd into Horrour by ſharp Uſage, and too ſtrong Impreſſions, it grows Furious and Deſperate, Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Bloody.

For in ſuch a Caſe the People will look upon their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as a ſort of Deity Incarnate; They will honour and adore him as ſuch; they will reſpect and love him as their Guardian, their Common Father, their Friend; and inſtead of any uneaſie Fear of Him, they will be in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fear for Him; tender of his Life and his Perſon; and in mighty Pain and Solicitude, leſt any Ill ſhould happen to either; conſequently they will be Zealous in his Defence, firm to all his Intereſts, averſe and implacable to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53648:481"/>their own; Readily to extend their Grace to ſmall Faults, and where ſuch eaſineſs may be inconvenient, to render heinous Offenders very exemplary, and make them ſmart ſeverely for their Inſolence and bold Contempt of the Laws. To conſider, that frequent Executions are an Aſperſion to their Government; and bring as great a Scandal upon their Reign, as the Death of many Patients doth to the Practice of a Phyſician; and therefore not to be fond of taking Men off upon every Provocation, but to content themſelves oftentimes with a Malefactor's Repentance; and eſteem the Senſe of his Guilt, his Shame, and Remorſe, and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation a Puniſhment ſufficient.

Such Mildneſs is a mighty ſtrengthening to a Prince; adds Vigour and Efficacy to his Commands, and wonderfully rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Reputation. A Prince, that is well belov'd, ſhall be able to do more with the Hearts of his Subjects, than all the Awe and Terror in the World; This may put Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trembling and aſtoniſhment, but it gives them no true Principle of Obedience; and as <hi>Saluſt</hi> argued in his Oration to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſuch Governments are never Stable and of long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance becauſe they are built upon an ill bottom. Whoever he be, that is feared by a great many, hath a great many whom he hath reaſon to be afraid of too. The Fear, which he ſheds down upon all about him, daſhes back again upon his own Head. Such a ſort of Life is full of Anxieties and Miſgivings; and a Man is ſurrounded with Dangers, that threaten him continually from every Quarter. It is true indeed, this Clemency ought not to be extended without
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53648:481"/>any Diſtinction; Judgment, as was ſaid in the beginning of the Paragraph, muſt direct and determine it. For, as it is a Virtue, and that which attracts the profoundeſt Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when judiciouſly managed; ſo is it a Vice of moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Conſequence, when degenerating into ſoft and eaſie Tameneſs.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> After theſe Four Principal Virtues, which are the brighteſt Jewels in a Prince's Diadem, <note place="margin">Liberality.</note> there follow ſome others of a Second Form; and theſe, though inferiour to the former in Luſtre, have yet their juſt Value, and are neceſſary and uſeful, though not ſo abſolutely, and in ſo high a degree. Liberality for inſtance, which is ſo much more ſuitable to a Prince's Character, as it is a greater Reflection upon him to be vanquiſh'd by Bounty and Magnificence, than to be worſted in the Field. But here too, there is great need of Diſcretion; for, where That is wanting, this Quality will be apt to do more Hurt than Good.</p>
                                 <p>There are two Kinds of Liberality. The one conſiſts in Sumptuouſneſs and Shew; and this is to very little purpoſe.<note place="margin">Of two Kinds.</note> It is certainly a very idle and vain Imagination, for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to think of raiſing their Character, and ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off by Auguſt, and Splendid, and expenſive Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: eſpecially too among their own Subjects, where they can do what they pleaſe, and are ſure to have no Rival of their Grandeur. This ſeems rather a Mark of a little Soul; an Argument, that they want a due Senſe of what they really are, and is both beneath Them to do, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to their People to ſee. For, however for the preſent Subjects may gaze at their Pomps with Delight, yet aſſoon as the Entertainment is over, they preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reflect, that Their Princes are thus enrich'd and adorn'd with Their Spoils; that This is no better than being ſumptuouſly feaſted at Their Coſt; and that the Money, which now feeds their Sight with Triumphs and Gaudy Greatneſs, is pinch'd from more neceſſary Occaſions, and wou'd have been much better ſav'd to feed their Bellies. And beſides all this; a Prince ſhould be ſo far from Laviſh and Profuſe, that he ſhould make great Conſcience of Frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for indeed he ſhould think nothing he enjoys ſtrictly his own; ſince engag'd in a Truſt, that requires his All, his very Life and Perſon to be devoted to the Good of others.</p>
                                 <p>The Second ſort of Liberality is that which conſiſts in diſtributing Gifts, and making Preſents: Of This indeed there is conſiderable Uſe, and a juſt Commendation due to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53648:482"/>it. But then this muſt be diſcreetly manag'd too; and good Care ſhould always be taken, To what Perſons, in what Proportions, and after what Manner this is done. As to the Perſons. They ought to be well choſen, ſuch whoſe Merits recommend them to their Bounty; ſuch as have been ſerviceable to the Publick; ſuch as have hazarded their Fortunes and their Perſons, and run thro' the Dangers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of War. Theſe are ſuch Perſons, as none but the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking or the very Ill-natur'd can grudg any thing to, or envy the Favour, ſo as to repreſent the Prince as Partial or Undiſtinguiſhing in his Liberality. Whereas, quite otherwiſe, great Gratuities diſtributed without any regard to Merit, and where there really is none, derive Shame and Odium upon the Receiver; and are entertain'd without thoſe due Acknowledgments, and that grateful Senſe, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of a Prince ought to find. Some Tyrants have been ſacrific'd and given up to the Rage and Spite of an incens'd Rabble, by thoſe very Servants whom they had rais'd from Nothing; while theſe Creatures of theirs have been as much diverted with their Maſters Misfortunes, as any of their Enemies, and have taken this Courſe to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Mobb, and for ſecuring their own Fortunes, by giving Demonſtrations of the Hatred and Contempt to the Perſon, from whom thoſe Fortunes were entirely deriv'd.</p>
                                 <p>Nor is it leſs neceſſary, that the Proportion of a Prince's Liberality ſhould be ſtrictly regarded; for otherwiſe this may run out into ſuch Squandering and Exceſs, That both the Giver and the Government may be impoveriſh'd and brought to Ruine by it. For, to give to every body, and upon every Occaſion, is to play with a loſing Hand, and till all's gone. Private Men are for making their Fortunes, and it is not poſſible to ſatisfie them; they will ſoon grow extravagant in their Requeſts, if they find their Prince to be ſo in his Favours; and the Rule they Meaſure by, is not Reaſon, but Example; not how much is fit to be granted to Them, but how much hath already been granted to Others. However, by this Means the Publick Treaſures will be exhauſted; and a King be neceſſitated to ſeize other Peoples Rights, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Quod Ambiticne exhauſtum, per Scelera ſupplendum.</note> ſo <hi>Injuſtice and Oppreſſion may heal and reimburſe theſe Wants, which Ambition and Prodigality have created.</hi> Now, it were inſinitely better to give nothing
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53648:482"/>at all, than to take away from one to give to another. For after all our Kindneſs, the Gratitude and Affection of thoſe that are obliged by us, never makes ſo deep Impreſſions, nor ſticks half ſo cloſe, as the Reſentments of them, that have been injur'd and plunder'd. Beſides, This Profuſeneſs is its own Deſtruction, for the Spring cannot run always; if you draw too faſt, it will ſoon be drain'd dry.<note n="*" place="bottom">Liberalitate Liberalitas perit.</note> 
                                    <hi>By being Liberal.</hi> ſays St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> Man <hi>makes it impoſſible to be ſo.</hi> For a farther Prevention whereof, as well as upon, other very good Conſiderations, it will be convenient to ſpin out ones Liberality; to let it come gently and by degrees, rather than to give all we intend at once. For that which is done on the ſudden, and at a heat, be the thing never ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in it ſelf, yet paſſes off, as it were inſenſibly, and is quickly forgotten. All things that have a grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhould be contriv'd to be as ſlow and leiſurely in the Paſſage, as can be; that ſo the Palate may have time to taſt them: but, on the contrary, all thoſe Diſpenſations that are harſh and ſevere, (when Occaſions call for any ſuch) ſhould be diſpatch'd with all poſſible Convenience, that ſo, like bitter Potions, they may be ſwallow'd at once. Thus you ſee, that the Giving as becomes one, is an Act of Prudence, and the Exerciſe of Liberality to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, requires great Addreſs and Skill. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath this notable Remark.<note n="†" place="bottom">Falluntur, quibus Luxuria Specie Liberalitatis imponit, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere multi ſciunt, donare neſciunt.</note> 
                                    <hi>Thoſe Perſons</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are under a mighty Errour, who know not how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Liberality and Luxury; abundance of Men know how to ſquander, that do not know how to give.</hi> And to ſpeak the very Truth, Liberality is not a Virtue peculiar to King's and milder Governments only, but very conſiſtent even with Tyranny it ſelf. And ſurely the Tutors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of young Princes are much in the wrong, when they labour to poſſeſs their Minds with ſuch ſtrong and early Impreſſions of Giving; of refuſing nothing that is ask'd of them; of thinking nothing ſo well employ'd, as what they give to their Friends. This is the Jargon uſual in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But either This ſeems to proceed from ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage theſe Inſtructors deſign to make of ſuch a Principle hereafter, or for want of due regard to the Perſon they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53648:483"/>themſelves to. For a too governing Notion of Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is of very ill Conſequence, in a Perſon, whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are ſo plentiful, as to ſupply the Expences of others, at what rate himſelf ſhall think fit. And of the Two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, though either of them are very far from Good, yet a Prodigal or a Giving Prince, he that ſpends upon his own Vanities, or he that ſeeds thoſe of his Servants and Favourites, without Diſcretion and due Meaſure, is a great deal worſe than a Stingy One, that keeps his Hand ſhut to all. And, whereas theſe frequent Boons are pretended of Uſe to make Friends, and ſecure the Service and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of thoſe who are obliged by them: There is very little or nothing of Subſtance in this Argument; For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and undiſtinguiſhing Liberality encourages every body to ask and to expect, and ſo for One Friend, makes Ten Enemies, in Proportion as the Repulſes muſt needs be more frequent, than the Grants. But indeed, if it be wiſely and well regulated, it is undoubtedly, as I ſaid before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Graceful and Commendable in a Prince, and may prove of Excellent Advantage, both to Himſelf and to the State.</p>

Upon this I ſhall not inſiſt at all, only, by the way as it were, touch upon it. Now though Nature contribute a great deal to this in the Form, and Temper, and Perſon, yet all that Nature does is capable of Amendment and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement both, by the additional Helps of Induſtry and Art. Under the Head we are now upon, may be reckoned the Air of his Face, the Compoſure of his Countenance, his Faſhion and Behaviour, his Gate, his Tone, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech, his Clothes and Dreſſing. The general Rule to be obſerved in all theſe Particulars, is ſuch a Mixture of Sweetneſs and Moderation, of Stayedneſs and Gravity, as may win upon Mens Minds, and move their Affections plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly; ſuch as may keep the middle Way between Familiarity and Fear, engage their Love, and yet command their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect. His Court and Converſation are likewiſe worth taking notice of. For the former, it is convenient that it ſhould be very publick, that the Palace he dwells in ſhould be Noble and Magnificent, ſit for Reſort and Correſpondence; and if that can be well contriv'd, not far from the Middle of his Country, or, at leaſt, the

Counſel.</note> The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of his People and Government, the Virtues of his Mind, and the Faſhion and Addreſs of the Prince; all which are inſeparable from his own Perſon; The next things we are led to conſider, are ſuch as are near and about his Perſon. And therefore in the fourth place, let us ſay ſomewhat concerning his Counſel, which, in truth, is the main Point of all this Head, which relates to his Politicks, and of Conſequence ſo vaſt, that it is in a manner All in All. For Counſel is the Soul of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the Spirit that inſuſes Life and Motion, Energy and Vigour into all the reſt. And upon the Account of This it is, that the Management of Affairs conſiſts in Prudence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hand, are of no Significance at all, till the Heads have cut them out their Work, and preſcrib'd their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. It were indeed to be wiſh'd, That a Prince were enrich'd with ſo great a Stock of Prudence and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as to be able himſelf to govern, and diſpoſe, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53648:484"/>contrive every thing, without calling in Help from abroad; This is ſuch a Sufficiency, as the firſt Chapter of this Book obſerved to be the Nobleſt Perfection, and higheſt Degree of Wiſdom; and no Queſtion can be made, but that Matters would be better order'd, and more ſucceſsfully diſpatch'd if it could be ſo. But this is an Accompliſhment meerly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, no Inſtance of it is to be found in Nature; whether it be, that Princes want the Advantage of Good Temper, or Good Inſtruction. And indeed, let Nature be never ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and Education never ſo proper, yet it is ſcarce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe That all the Parts, and all the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World could ever qualifie one ſingle Head for the Comprehending and Direction of ſuch infinite Variety of Buſineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nequit Princeps ſuâ ſcientià cuncta complecti; nee unius Mens tantae molis eſt capax.</note>

Great Weights and great Undertakings can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made light by a Multitude of Hands. And therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary for a Prince to provide himſelf with good Advice, and with Perſons every way capable of giving it; for as the Caſe ſtands, and the Intrigues of Government are perplex'd, he that will take upon him to do all of his own Head, ſhall much ſooner ſix upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Character of Pride and Conceitedneſs, than gain the Reputation of Wiſdom.

And it ſhews the Dexterity and Addreſs of a Counſellor, to be able to change his Methods, when thoſe which were firſt choſen are either diſapproved, or by ſome Accident rendred uſeleſs and ineffectual.</p>
                                 <p>Another neceſſary Accompliſhment for this Poſt, is the making a Conſcience of Revealing any Debates he ſhall be privy to. For Silence and Secreſie are exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the management of all Publick Aſſairs: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a great Author hath pronounced it impoſſible for that Man to manage any matter of Conſequence, who is not ſo much Maſter of himſelf as to keep his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.<note n="†" place="bottom">Res magnae ſuſtinere nequeunt ab eo, cui tacere grave eſt.</note> For how ſhould he ſupport the weight of Publick Buſineſs, to whom even Silence is a Burden? But upon this Occaſion the concealing what one knows is not ſufficient, I muſt likewiſe caution him againſt knowing too much. A Curious and Inquiſitive Temper, which loves to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and inform it ſelf of other Peoples Actions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, is no commendable Quality in any caſe; but to pry
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53648:486"/>into the Affairs of Princes, and value one's ſelf upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Their Secrets, is as dangerous as it is unmannerly: And as <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath well obſerved,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exquirere abditos Principis ſenſus illicitum &amp; anceps. <hi>Tacit.</hi>
                                    </note> Nothing is more hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, nothing more unfit for us, than officiouſly to dive, and be bold with their retired Thoughts and Intentions. And therefore, whatever a Man knows of this kind ſhould come freely and without his ſeeking; nay, I make no difficulty to affirm, that it is commendable in a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Opportunities of having ſuch things imparted to him, and to know as little of them as poſſibly he can. This argues Reverence and Modeſty, prevents all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and ſutes the diſtance between a Prince and his Subjects.</p>
                                 <p>Thus I have given my Reader a ſhort Account of thoſe good Conditions which ſeem neceſſary for the qualifying Men to be Counſellors of State. And by theſe he will be able to tell himſelf, what are thoſe ill Qualities, which meapacitate a Man for ſuch a Truſt. That a Prince in making his Choice, ſhould be ſure to reject all ſuch as are of Confident, Aſſuming, Preſumptuous Tempers; becauſe theſe Vices make Men hot, and arrogant in Debates, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and bold in their own Senſe: And a Wiſe Man, quite contrary, will be content to allow Second and Third Thoughts; to examine every thing over and over. It is the Character of ſuch a one to ſuſpect himſelf, to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Conſequence, ſearful in adviſing and reſolving, that ſo he may afterwards be more vigorous and aſſured, when he comes to execution.<note n="†" place="bottom">Nam Animus vereri qui ſcit, ſcit tuto aggredi.</note>

Court-Officers, and mercenary Wretches, whoſe Confidence is a Reproach to their Maſter; and will be his Ruine, when they can have a good Price for betraying him. For after all: the Cabal, and the Cabinet is the Foundation of moſt Monarch's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing:
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53648:487"/>We ſee it not, till it comes upon the open Stage; but there it begun, and from thence it moves and works under Ground, long before the World can diſcern it. Now, when a Prince hath made this Choice, and ſound Perſons for his Purpoſe, the next thing incumbent upon him is to make a Wiſe Uſe of them. And That is to be done, by conſulting them early and in a Seaſon proper for Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not driving all off, till the very Inſtant of Action, when the Time is too ſhort for debate, and cool Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor, on the other Hand, Trifling and loſing Time in hearing their tedious Diſputes, when his Affairs require a ſpeedy Reſolution. Again, This Advice of theirs muſt be attended to with a Judicious Reſerve; he muſt not give himſelf blindly up to it, and follow their Determinations Right or Wrong, as that very weak Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> is ſaid to have done: And he muſt likewiſe temper this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion with Moderation and Gentleneſs, without being too ſtiff and inflexible in his own Senſe: Since, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Remark of the wiſe <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> holds good, who ſays it is better for one Man to come over, and to comply with the Advice of a great many good Friends, than that all their Opinions ſhould be ſet aſide, and they forced to truckle to his ſingle Arbitrary Pleaſure. I cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it of great Advantage in this Caſe, to keep a Man's ſelf pretty looſe, and uſe ones Counſellors, with a ſort of Authority mix'd with Indifference. My Meaning is, Not immediately to reward Men for their good Counſel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch preſent Pay will be a Temptation to ill Men to thruſt themſelves forward in adviſing; and ſo that which is really bad, will be put upon him in hopes of a Reward; Nor on the other Hand to diſcountenance or uſe Men roughly for counſelling amiſs; Becauſe this will create a Shyneſs in all about him; and no body will dare to adviſe freely if the delivering their Opinion ſhall expoſe them to Danger and Diſgrace. And beſides, The Judgment of good and bad Counſel is very uncertain, becauſe it uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the Iſſue. Whereas the moſt injudicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels have often ſucceeded as well or better than the Wiſeſt, by a ſtrange over-ruling Power of Providence, thus aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Government of us, and all our Affairs here below. And again, It ought to be remembred, that They, who give the beſt, that is, the ſafeſt and moſt proſperous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, are not upon that Account to be concluded our faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Friends, nor beſt affected to our Intereſt; for many
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53648:488"/>times They who love us beſt, may be miſtaken in their Meaſures; and they who wiſh us no Good, may yet put us in the way of a great deal. Nor ought a Prince to reſent Freedom and Plainneſs upon theſe Occaſions. For This in all Reaſon ought rather to be acceptable; and a wiſe Man will keep a Jealous Eye upon Flattering and Timorous Fellows, ſuch as make it their Buſineſs to ſooth his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and had rather ſee him periſh by falſe Meaſures, than diſguſt him to his own Advantage. And ſure if there be a Miſerable Creature upon Earth, it is that Prince, to whom no Body about him dares tell the Truth; he that muſt live by the help of other Peoples Senſes, and yet all who ſee and hear for him, are under a neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and diſguiſing in their own Defence, and dare ſhew him nothing as it really is.

And They ought to be made Choice of with great Diſcretion; Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Virtue, well-deſcended, and whoſe Families are of Quality and Reputation in the World. It is reaſonable to believe, that Men of this Character will approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſt in their reſpective Stations; and That of Birth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly is ſo conſiderable a Qualification, that it is by no Means for the Honour of a Prince, or the Decency of his Court, that People of mean Extract ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near his Perſon, and commiſſioned to preſide over others, except ſome very great and remarkable Merit, give them
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53648:488"/>a juſt and viſible preference, and make amends for the want of Quality and Deſcent. But Men of Infamous Lives, Falſe and Baſe; Men of no Principles, or of ſuch as are Dangerous and Worſe than none; in ſhort, Men under Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which either fix an odious Character, ſuch as the World have reaſon to hate, or to deſpiſe, to be aſham'd of, or to ſuſpect, ſhould not upon any Terms be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any Office or Truſt. After theſe Conditions, as to their Morals, we muſt not forget, that as great a Regard is due to their Underſtandings. And that, not only to ſee, that they be Men of Parts and Judgment in general, but that each Perſon be diſpos'd of to ſuch an Employment, as beſt agrees with his own Genius and Attainments in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For ſome are Naturally fitteſt for Military, and others for Civil Truſts. Some have thought it a general good Rule for Officers of all ſorts, to chooſe Men of a mild and gentle Diſpoſition, and moderate Character; for your violent and topping Spirits, that are full of themſelves, and cannot be prevail'd upon to yield to any, or quit the leaſt Punctilio, commonly ſpeaking, are not at all fit for Buſineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ut pares negotiis, neque ſuprà; ſint recti, non erecti.</note> Let the Perſons you employ be therefore a Match for their Buſineſs, and able to deal with it; but not too much above, and able to play with it; Men that know how to give and take their Due, but not ſuch as will ſacrifice the Publick to a Nice Point of Honour, and their own Unſeaſonable Vanity.</p>

If Advice be the Head that ſees and directs, Money is the Nerves, the Hands, the Feet of the State, by which it moves, and acts, and is ſtrongly knit together. For when all is done, there is no Sword cuts deep, not makes its own way through, like that with a Silver Edge. No Maſter is ſo Abſolute in his Commands, ſo readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd; No Orator ſo Eloquent, ſo Perſuaſive, ſo Winning upon the Wills and Affections of Men; no Conquerour ſo Succeſsful, or ſo great a Gainer by Storms, and Sieges, and force of Arms, as a good Purſe. This is ſerv'd with Zeal, and obeyed without Grudging; this gets Poſſeſſion of Hearts, and draws the World after it; this takes Towns and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, without the Expence of Blood, or Time, or Hazard.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53648:489"/>And therefore a Wiſe Prince will always think himſelf oblig'd to take care, that his Treaſury be in good Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that he never be diſabled in this ſo very neceſſary, ſo vital a Part of his Government. Now, the Art and the Care of effecting and ſecuring this, conſiſts in Three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The Firſt whereof concerns the providing good Funds; The Second in employing the Money ariſing from them to the beſt Advantage; and the Third in keeping a conſtant Reſerve, that he may never be deſtitute of a neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, upon any ſudden Accident, or preſſing Occaſion. And in all theſe Caſes, there are Two things, which the Prince muſt by all means look upon himſelf bound to avoid; which are Injuſtice, and ſordid Frugality; for how Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and Advantagious ſoever the Obſervation of theſe Rules may be, yet he muſt never purchaſe this Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at ſo dear a Rate, as the Invaſion of other Men's Rights, or the loſs of his own Honour.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> For the Firſt of theſe, which relates to laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as it were, and amaſſing together a ſufficient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there are ſeveral Methods of doing it. Many Springs, which, like ſo many little Streams, contribute to the filling up this common Ciſtern;<note place="margin">Funds.</note> but, though all of them pour in ſome, yet they do not all ſupply the ſame Proportion, nor are they all perpetual, or equally to be depended upon. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. One Fund is the Crown Lands,<note place="margin">I.</note> and Demeſnes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding Revenues appointed to the Uſe of the Prince, for the Support of his Grandeur and Government. And theſe ought to be husbanded to the beſt Advantage, and kept up to their old Rents, and put into good Hands: They ſhould by no means be alienated without ſome very urgent Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy require it; but look'd upon as things Sacred, and ſuch as in their own Nature are not transferrable to any other Owner.<note place="margin">II.</note> Another is, the Conqueſts made upon Enemies, which ſhould be ſo ordered, as to turn to good Account; and not ſquandered, and prodigally waſted, becauſe they are a ſort of additional Wealth, and when they are gone, the Prince is but where he was before. The Power of old <hi>Rome</hi> is in great Meaſure owing to their good Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Point: They always took Care to bring in vaſt Summs, not only to pay the Charge of the War, but to enrich and ſwell their Exchequers with the Wealth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred thither from the Towns they took, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they vanquiſhed. This their Hiſtorian <hi>Livy</hi> tells us, was the Practice of their Braveſt and moſt Renown'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53648:489"/>
                                    <hi>Camillus, Flaminius, Aemilius Paulus,</hi> the <hi>Scipios, Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and not only ſo, but after this firſt drawing over their preſent Treaſures, they conſtantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Yearly Stipend to be paid; either by the Natives left upon their own Soil, under theſe and certain other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; or by thoſe Colonies of <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted thither. But ſtill every Conqueſt brought ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Advantage to the Common-Wealth, and was more than an empty Name, and the meer Glory of the Thing. The Preſents, Free-Gifts, Penſions, Donations, and Grants,<note place="margin">III.</note> Tributes, Taxes, ariſing either from Friends, or Allies, or Subjects; Legacies and Bequeſts of the Dead, Deeds of Gift from Owners yet ſurviving, or any other manner of Conveyance: Tolls, and Impoſts,<note place="margin">IV.</note> Cuſtoms upon Goods imported or exported, Commodities Foreign or Domeſtick, Duties upon Docks, and Havens, Ports and Rivers; which hath been a general and very ancient Method of raiſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as well upon Strangers as Natives; and a very juſt, lawful, and beneficial Method no doubt it is, when limited with theſe Conditions; That no Proviſions or Other Goods, that are Neceſſaries of Life, ſhall be tranſported, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the Country, and reduce the Subject to Streights; nor any raw Wares; but that Materials of home-growth ſhould be likewiſe wrought up and finiſh'd at Home; to find the Subjects Employment, and keep the poor and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People at Work, upon their own Manufacture; that ſo the Profit and Wages, as well as the Stuff might centre and circulate among Natives; and the Growth of one Nation not be transferr'd to the enriching of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But now, when theſe Commodities are wrought and dreſs'd, there is good Reaſon for carrying them to foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; as it is likewiſe Policy to import all the raw and unwrought Commodities they can, and to prohibit all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and finiſh'd Manufactures; becauſe in all theſe Caſes there is greater Encouragement, and Opportunity given for Labour. And it is alſo highly reaſonable in all Matters of Traffick, that a heavier Impoſition ſhould be laid upon Strangers who trade among us, than the natural Subjects of the ſame Country. For all foreign Impoſitions bring large Summs into the Treaſury, and are a great Eaſe to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is a Conſideration always to be regarded; and for that Reaſon the Cuſtoms which are laid upon all ſuch Neceſſaries of Life, as are imported from abroad, ſhould be moderated, and brought as low, as poſſibly they can.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53648:490"/>Theſe Four Methods already mention'd, are not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, and convenient, but ſtrictly Juſt, and Equitable; Honourable and Fair. The Fifth, which, I conſeſs, is not altogether ſo agreable to Decency,<note place="margin">V.</note> and the Dignity of a Prince, is That of Trade, which is carried on for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Sovereign by means of his Factors, and hath ſeveral Methods of turning to Account, which are ſome leſs, and ſome more liable to Scandal; but the moſt Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and the moſt Deſtructive of all, is the ſetting to ſale Offices, and Honours, Preferments and Places of Truſt. There is indeed a Courſe not yet mention'd, which I think will come within the Notion of Trade; and therefore I chooſe to name it under this Head, for the ſake of the Reſemblance it bears to the Subject now in Hand. This hath no great Matter of Indecency in it, and hath the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſeveral very wiſe and eminent Princes to give it Countenance; It is the letting out the publick Money in Bank, upon a moderate Intereſt, (as Five in the Hundred Proſit for inſtance) and ſecuring the Principal, either by an Equivalent in Pawns, or Mortgages, or elſe ſuch Perſonal Security, as is ſufficient and of unqueſtionable Credit. And theſe Loans are of great Advantage in Three Reſpects: For Firſt, They add greatly to the Wealth of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by taking Care, that it ſhall always turn to freſh Account, and no part of it ever lie dead. Then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is a mighty Convenience to private Men, who by this means are ſure of a Fund to trade upon; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſail of being furniſhed in any Proportion which their Occaſions ſhall require, or which they can find ſuch Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as is fit to be accepted for. But the Third and greateſt Senefit of all is, That it keeps this Money out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>

And upon this laſt Conſideration ſingly, to ſave the Trouble of being importuned, and the Difficulties of denying; ſome Princes have found it adviſable to lend out their ready Caſh without any Intereſt to be paid upon at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                       <desc>••</desc>
                                    </gap> purely for the ſake of ſecuring the Prime Summ, which they took Care to do, by binding the Debtor in a Penalty of paying double, if he were not Punctual to his Day.<note place="margin">VI.</note> The Sixth and Laſt Method is That of Loans and Subſides extraordinary levied upon the Subject; and this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53648:490"/>ſhou'd be a Reſerve for times of Neceſſity, a Remedy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be made uſe of with Reluctancy, and ſuch as is properly applyed, when other ſtated Methods fall ſhort, and the Exigence of Affairs calls for a larger Supply, than the former Particulars can furniſh out. In the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Kind, no doubt can be made of the Juſtice of the Thing: But then to make this ſtill more eaſie and gentle to the Subject, it is not only requiſite, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch Supplies be evident, and the Publick Safety highly concern'd in them, but theſe following Conditions ſhould likewiſe concur to the ſofining them. Firſt:<note place="margin">I.</note> That whatever Moneys are advanc'd upon Loans for the ſerving a preſent Occaſion, ſhould be afterwards punctually and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly paid back again, as ſoon as the Difficulty is over, and the Occaſion ſerv'd. This we find practiſed by the Common-Wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> when driven to Extremities by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> And at this Rate the Prince will never want Money; for while the Exchequer keeps Touch and Credit, private Men will be pleas'd, nay proud to lend; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they think their Caſh depoſited in ſafe Hands, and can depend upon their own again with Advantage; but for the Honour and Reputation of having aſſiſted the Publick, and ſerv'd their Prince in a time of Diſtreſs. And this to generous Men is a Valuable, and will always be a Powerful Conſideration, where the Hazard and Fears of a Loſs do not check it. But Secondly,<note place="margin">II.</note> If the Publick Stock be drawn ſo low, that the Debt cannot be ſatisfied from thence, and ſome freſh extraordinary Impoſition be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, this ſhould by all Means be adjuſted and charged, with the Conſent of the Subjects, who are to contribute toward it; The preſent Defects of the Treaſury fairly ſtated, the Occaſion that exhauſted it fully repreſented, and the People made truly ſenſible of the neceſſity they are under; ſo preſſing upon them that Paſſage of the Bleſſed Saviour, the Gracious King of Kings, <hi>The Lord hath need of them;</hi> for thus He in marvelous Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was pleas'd to expreſs himſelf. And in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if the Caſe require it, and the Satisfaction of the People can be effectually conſulted upon thoſe Terms, it may be very adviſable to lay an Account of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Expences before them. Perſuaſion and fair Means are always beſt employed in Matters of this Nature; and to be driven to uſe Power and Conſtraint, is the laſt Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that can happen to a Governor. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53648:491"/>in the right, when he thought it more for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Ruler<note n="*" place="bottom">Impetrare melius eſt quam imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Third Courſe to qualifie theſe Impoſitions, would be, to lay them not upon Perſons, but Eſtates; that Men may pay for what they have, and not for what they are. For a Poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax hath every where been looked upon as the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any; it being indeed by no means juſt, that all ſhould be levelled, where Fortune hath made ſo vaſt a difference; and while the Men of Wealth, and Honour, and Noble birth pay little or nothing, that the greateſt part of the Duty ſhould riſe upon poor Country People, who work hard for their Living. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> But eſpecially ſhould all poſſible care be taken in the Fourth place, that ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies ſhould be levy'd fairly and equally. For the being rack't and ſcrew'd above one's proportion, is a very grating and intolerable thing, and breeds more murmuring and Contention, than the Charge it ſelf. Now in order to bring every body in, to bear a part in this common Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it will be convenient, to tax ſuch Proviſions with it, as all Mankind have occaſion for, and muſt make uſe of: Such as Salt, and Drink, and the like; for thus the Exciſe will be univerſal; and every Member of the Publick Body will be inexcuſably obliged to contribute ſomething to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Neceſſity. Beſides theſe indeed there may, and it is but reaſonable there ſhould, be conſtant and heavy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances laid upon ſuch Commodities, whether Foreign or Domeſtick, as are vicious in their uſe, and tend only to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53648:491"/>debauch the Subject; and thus all thoſe things manifeſtly do, which ſerve only for Luxury and vain Pomp; ſuch as are purchaſed at dear Rates, merely out of extravagant Humour, or uſeleſs Curioſity; all ſuperfluous State in Diet, Clothes, Equipage, the Inſtruments of Pleaſure, Corrupters of Manners, and whatever contributes to a Licentious way of Living. And the loading ſuch things with ſuch Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as ſhall make them yet more expenſive, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prove the beſt Method to diſcourage the uſe of them. For Men in the midſt of Luxury, will ſometimes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſave their Purſes, and abſtain upon a Conſideration of Tenderneſs in that reſpect; when their Conſciences would be ſo far from being reſtrain'd by Laws, that a poſitive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition would rather ſet a ſharper Edge upon their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and make them but ſo much more impatient and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to come at theſe things.</p>
                                 <p>The Second Branch of this Science, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> relating to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> is the taking good Care that they be well employ'd.<note place="margin">The uſing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure well.</note> And to this Purpoſe I will here lay down a ſhort account of the ſeveral Heads of Expence, upon which a Prince muſt neceſſarily, and ought in Duty to make uſe of them. Such are, There Subſiſtence and honourable Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Houſhold, the Pay of the Soldiers, the Wages of Officers of all ſorts, the juſt Rewards of ſuch, as by their good Services have merited of the Publick; The Penſions and charitable Relief extended to thoſe who come well recommended, and are proper Objects of his Royal Bounty and Compaſſion. Theſe Five are conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Occaſions. But then there are others too, very uſeful and fitting, tho' not ſo abſolutely and always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſuch as the Reparation of old decay'd Towns, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the Frontiers of his Country, amending the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and making Roads as direct and convenient as the Condition of the Place will bear; keeping up Bridges, and all other neceſſary Accommodations for Travellers; found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colleges for the ſtudy and improvement of Learning, and Religion, and Virtue; Building and Endowing Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals for diſtreſſed and diſabled People, and erecting Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Halls, and other Structures, that are for the Honour and Service of the State. Theſe ſorts of Repairs, and Fortifications, and Foundations, are of excellent uſe and advantage, beſides the Profit which immediately redounds to the State in general by their means: For by promoting ſuch Deſigns, Art is encouraged and improved, Workmen
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53648:492"/>are kept in Employment, the People are highly contented and pleaſed, and a great part of that Grudging and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining uſual to the Commonalty, is prevented and cured, when they ſee their Taxes converted to ſo good uſes, and The Benefit comes back to them again: But eſpecially theſe two great Banes of any Commonwealth are by this means utterly baniſhed, the Plague of Idleneſs, and the Scandal of Poverty and Beggery. Whereas on the contrary, the conſuming the Publick Wealth in extravagant Gifts to ſome particular Favourites, in ſtately but unneceſſary Buildings, or in other vain Expences, for which there is no need, and whereof there can be no uſe, draws a general Odium and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For the Subjects cannot bear to think that ſo many Thouſand ſhould be ſtripped to clothe and make one Man ſine; that another ſhould ſtrut and look big with their Money; and that the great Houſes ſhould be built with their Blood, and the Sweat of their Brows: For ſuch as theſe are the grumbling Terms, in which the Vulgar, when provoked to diſcontent, murmur out their Reſentments; and nothing touches them ſo near as Money, and a Notion of Extravagance and Waſtfulneſs in the Diſpoſal of their Taxes.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> The Third and Laſt Part of this Advice conſiſts in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care to have a good Supply in reſerve for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Exigence that may happen: <note place="margin">Saving.</note> That ſo, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of neceſſity, a Prince may not be driven to ſudden and unjuſt Remedies, nor uſe Violence upon others to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This Store thus laid up, and frugally managed for the Prince to draw out as he ſees ſit, is the common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Exchequer. Now in the management of this Article, there are two Extremes which muſt be both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, becauſe each of them is of very dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Perſon that falls into it. The One is, That of immoderate Greedineſs in amaſſing prodigious Summs; for ſuch Treaſures, tho' got by Methods never ſo juſt and honourable, are not always the moſt for a Prince's Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when they are out of meaſure. They really very often involve him in Wars, either by putting him upon Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and invading his weaker Neighbours, in confidence of hisown Strength, and tha the longeſt Purſe will be ſure to carry it at laſt; or elſe they are a Bait to ſome Enemy to fall upon Him. And threfore it is much more for the Safety and Advantage, as well as for the Honour of a King, to convert them to ſuch uſes as have been already mentioned, than to let them grow exorbitantly great upon
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53648:492"/>hishands, and ſo either tempt the Owner to Inſolence, or expoſe him for a Prey to thoſe who want ſuch Prize. The Other Extreme is ſpending all, and keeping nothing to help at a Pinch; and This is worſe than the Former; for ſuch a Governour ſtands naked and defenceleſs, and like a fooliſh Gameſter, plays away his laſt Stake. And therefore all wiſe Governours take care not to fall into this deſperate Condition.

                                 <p>Now the Method in uſe heretofore, for preſerving theſe great Treaſures from being ſpent and ſquander'd away pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely, or being ſtoln, and ſecretly broke in upon, was to melt them down into large maſſy Ingots or Balls, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to do; or elſe to lay them up in the Temples of their Gods, as the ſecureſt and moſt ſacred Repoſitory, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> frequently did in the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Though this did not always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their Expectation; for Covetouſneſs often broke through the moſt ſuperſtitious Reverence for their Deities,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53648:493"/>and plunder'd their very Gods themſelves, in deſpight and defiance of all their imaginary Thunder. Thus alſo the <hi>Romans</hi> held their Office of <hi>Exchequer</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Saturn.</hi> But that, which of all others ſeems to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſafeſt, but the moſt gainful Courſe, is what Imen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, of lending out theſe Summs to Private Men at a moderate Intereſt, upon good Pawns, or ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, Real or Perſonal. Again, Another adviſable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for preſerving the Publick Treaſures from Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſhoneſty, is to take good care in diſpoſing of the Offices concerned about them. For ſure the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a Truſt is of too great importance to be ſet to ſale; and no Fidelity can be expected, where Men are out of Pocket, and muſt reimburſe themſelves at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Expence: Nor ſhould Men of mean Quality, vulgar and Mechanick People, be admitted to purchaſe them; but they ought in all reaſon to be put into the Hands of Men of Birth and Fortunes, ſuch as may be ſuppoſed to act upon Principles of Honour, and whoſe Circumſtances ſet them above any violent Temptations of ſordid or foul Dealing: And in this particular the old <hi>Romans</hi> ſet us a good Pattern, who entred the young Gentlemen of their beſt Families in <hi>Rome</hi> in this kind of Buſineſs: They lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the nobleſt Education; and from this firſt ſetting out, their greateſt Men were raiſed by degrees to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honours, and moſt important Offices in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> His Army, I think may very fitly be placed after the Counſel,<note place="margin">The Sixth Head Nilitary Force.</note> and the Treaſury of a Prince; for Nature it ſelf hath put that Precedence out of diſpute, by making it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Forces, either to be well raiſed, or well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſed ſucceſsfully, and to good purpoſe; or indeed ſo much as to ſubſiſt, when they are raiſed without the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Direction of thoſe two former Proviſions. Now a Military Force is abſolutely neceſſary for a Prince, to be a Terrour to his Enemies, a Guard and Security to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government: And for any Man in a Throne to think of ſitting quiet there any conſiderable time, without ſome Number of Forces, is the fondeſt Imagination in the World. There is never any perfect Security between the Weak and the Strong; and no State was never yet ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as to be quite void of turbulent Spirits, and free from Dangers and Diſturbances, both at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Now this Power is either a conſtant determinate

The Ordinary ſtanding Forces are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Perſons and Places. The Perſons are of Two ſorts. There are the King's Guards, ſuch as always attend his Perſon, and are of uſe, not only as they contribute to the Safety and Preſervation of his Royal Life; but likewiſe as they add to his Pomp and Grandeur, in making all his Appearances more auguſt and venerable, and every way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo ſublime a Character. For that ſo mightily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Saying of <hi>Ageſilau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                       </gap>,</hi> That a Prince might always be ſafe without any Guard at all, provided he commanded as he ought, and uſed his Subject as an affectionate and wiſe Father would deal by his Children. This Aphoriſm, I ſay, is far from being alays true; and He were a Mad-man, who at this time of Day would venture to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and depend upon the beſt nd gentleſt Treatment for his Security. For alas! the Wickedneſs of the World is not ſo eaſily won upon; and Men are too ill-natur'd to be charmed into Gratitude, and Returns of Duty, by all the Tenderneſs, and Affection, and Deſert in the World.</p>
                                 <p>Beſides theſe Guards, it is neceſſary there ſhould be ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Troops kept in conſtant Pay, and perfectly well-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, which may be ready upon any ſudden Accident that ſhall require their Uſe and Aſſiſtance; For it would be extremely improvident to have no Preparations of this kind, and drive off the raiſing of Men, and qualifying them for Service, till the very inſtant that Neceſſity calls for them.</p>
                                 <p>As for the Places, in which ſuch Forces are diſpoſed, they are properly the Forts and Caſtles upon the Frontiers, which ought conſtantly to be well Mann'd, and provided with Arms and Ammunition, to prevent Surprize, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions from abroad: Inſtead of which, the Ancients here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and ſome at this Day, chooſe rather to tranſplant the Foreigners and former Inhabitants, and to people all ſuch Towns with new and populous Colonies of their own, as they enlarge their Borders by freſh Conqueſts.</p>
                                 <p>The Extraordinary Forces conſiſt of formed Armies, which a Prince finds himſelf obliged to raiſe, and make a plentiful Proviſion of in time of War. Now, what Methods he ought to govern himſelf by in this reſpect; for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking any Military Enterprize, is a Conſideration rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53648:494"/>to the Second Branch of this Politick Prudence, That of Action, I mean, which will be treated of in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter; and falls not within this Firſt, which is only the Proviſionary part, and ſuch as is requiſite by way of a Preparatory tothe other. All therefore that I ſhall ſay upon this Subject at preſent, is only, That a wiſe Prince will always take care, beſides his own Guards, to have a competent number of Men in actual Pay, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſciſplined and experienc'd in the Buſneſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And that this number ought to be greater or leſs, in proportion to the Extent of his Dominions, and the Condition of the Government, to ſecure Obedience and good Order, and immediately to ſuppreſs any Seditious Practices and Commotions, which give Diſturbance, and Threaten any Danger, either from ſactious Subjects, or buſie deſigning Enemies. Reſerving ſtill to himſelf the Power and Opportunity of making new and greater Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, when he ſhall be forced into a formal War, and to take the Field in good earneſt; whether that War ſhall happen to oblige him in acting Offenſively or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. And in the mean while, that his Arſenals and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines be conſtantly well ſtored with all manner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and deſenſive Weapons, that ſo both Horſe and Foot may be ſufficiently furniſhed, and compleatly equipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Difficulty or Delay.

Such Preparations are not only neceſſary in order to making War and ſuſtaining our ſelves, when Acts of Hoſtility are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon us, and conſequently ſuch as every State ought to be beforehand with, becauſe they require a great deal of Time and Expence to have them in readineſs for uſe; but they are excelent Preventions too, and many times put a ſtop to the Deſigns of levying War upon us. For few Enemies will tempt a Danger, or venture upon a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is always in Condition to receive, and revenge their Attempts. Surprize, and Advantage, and the being an Over-match, are the Conſiderations that animate Strangers abroad, or Parties at home, to injure and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us. The beſt Security, when all is done, will be for a Prince to render himſelf formidable; and Men are moſt likely to be quiet, when they dare not be otherwiſe for their town ſakes. So infallible, ſo eternal a Maxim is it

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> After all theſe neceſſary and eſſential Proviſions already mentioned, I add in the laſt place. That of Alliances; <note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head. Alliances.</note> which is by no means an inconſiderable Point, but a mighty ſtrengthening and ſupport to any Government. But then the greateſt part of this Advantage is owing to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Choice, and good Conduct; and therefore good care muſt be taken with Whom thoſe Alliances are made, and upon what ſort of Terms they are eſtabliſhed.</p>
                                 <p>The Perſons moſt proper for the Friendſhip and Alliance of a Prince, are Neighbours, and Perſons of Power and Intereſt. For if they be either weak or remote, what Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance are they in any Capacity of giving? The only Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that can render ſuch neceſſary, and engage us in their Intereſts, is, the being attack'd by a powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo as that by ruining Them, he gains an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deſtroy Us; and ſo the ſuccouring Them, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Our ſelves. In ſuch a Caſe, let the Allie be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe never ſo unworthy our regard, we ought to join Forces and defend him with our utmoſt Might. And, if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this openly may be a means of involving us in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then there muſt be a good Underſtanding and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance given under-hand; for it is a Maſter-piece in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, to manage a Confederacy with one Prince bare-ſac'd, and in the Eye of all the World; and to be well with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other all the while, by an Agreement behind the Curtain, and unſuſpected. But ſtill my meaning is, that ſuch Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſhould be free from all Treachery, and Baſeneſs, and ſoul Dealing: For Wickedneſs and Falſhood are never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable; but Prudence and good Management are highly to be commended; tho' even Theſe, when they run into Intrigue and Doubling, are more eſpecially to be reſerved for acting the Defenſive part, and ſecuring the Government from ſome imminent Danger; Caſes that admit a much greater Latitude than acting Offenſively, and where there is no urgent Neceſſity, will bear one out in.</p>
                                 <p>But it ought to be farther obſerved, that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts and Degrees of Alliance. The loweſt and moſt ſimple of all, is That which extends only to an Agreement for mutual Trading and Commerce between the Countries
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53648:495"/>concerned; but the more uſual kind is that which obliges to Friendſhip, and reciprocal Kindneſs; and this is either Defenſive only; or elſe Offenſive and Defenſive both: And that again, by a League either limited, and with an Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſome particular Princes and States reſerved out of the Treaty; or elſe general, and without any Reſtraint or Exception at all. The cloſeſt and moſt perfect Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is that which is Offenſive and Deſenſive, for and againſt all Perſons whatſoever; this is an Engagement to ſuccour and be a Friend to all Their Friends; and to oppoſe and be an Enemy to all Their Enemies. And this Agreement is of great Convenience to be made with Princes of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great Influence, and upon an equal Foot; ſo that each ſide engage upon the ſame Terms. Again, Alliances may differ in Point of Time; Some are preſcribed and limited to a certain Term; Others are perpetual. The more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way is to make them without any fixt Term men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Treaty, and theſe are call'd <hi>Perpetual:</hi> But the better and ſafer Courſe is to limit it to a number of Years expreſly. Becauſe then the Renewal gives liberty for ſecond Thoughts. Some Articles may be added, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; left out. In a Word, Any alterations may then be made, as the Circumſtances or Inclinations of the Parties happen to vary: Or if occaſion be, either of them is freely and entirely at his own Diſpoſal, to break off, and be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely diſengag'd for the future. Nay, tho' the Condition of theſe Treaties, and the Princes concerned in them, be ſuch as one would wiſh to perpetuate them; yet even thus it is more convenient to repeat the Engagements, and enter into freſh Covenants upon freſh Conſideration, than to enter into a perpetual League at once. (Provided always, that in ſuch Caſes the Treaty be concluded, and all made faſt again, before the utter Expiration of the former Term.) For all Compacts of this kind naturally languiſh and cool in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time; and He that finds it for his Convenience to be off, will be more apt to violate his Faith, if the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be perpetual, and give him no proſpect of Redreſs; than if it be limited, and ſo he can ſee to the End of his Grievance. For in this Caſe he will be render of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and wait with Patience till he be abſolved of Courſe, and can come off without any Blemiſh. And thus you have ſeen what thoſe Seven Heads are, which I thought neceſſary for the Proviſionary part of Civil Prudence.</p>

                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> HAving thus inſiſted at large upon the Proviſion a Prince ought to make, and inſtructed him, what Ornaments and Furniture, what Defence and what Securities, (if I may ſo term them) are neceſſary for the Honour and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Perſon and his Government; and not only ſo, but likewiſe what Courſes are proper to be taken for the acquiring and furniſhing out ſuch Suplies: Let us now proceed to Action, and obſerve, after what manner theſe things ought to be made uſe of, and employ'd to be beſt Advantage. But, before we come to treat of this Matter diſtinctly, and with reference to the ſeveral Branches of the former Diviſion reſpectively, we may venture to ſay in general, That This whole Matter conſiſts in governing well; and again, That a good Adminiſtration with regard both to the Welfare and Obedience of the Subject, and the Security of the Prince, will depend chiefly upon ſuch a ſort of Conduct as ſhall acquire him Two things, hearty Good-Will I mean, and Authority. The Former is That Affectionate Concern and Kindneſs which Subjects ſhould retain for their Sovereign and his Government. The Latter is a good and great Opinion, an honourable Eſteem of Him and his Government. With reſpect to the Former of Theſe it is, that a Prince is belov'd, and by virtue of the Latter he is fear'd and ſtood in awe of. Now Theſe two Affections of Love and Fear, tho' they be very diſtant, yet are they by no means contrary to, or deſtructive of one another; and conſequently neither are thoſe Regards ſo, which in the preſent Caſe flow from, and are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of thoſe Paſſions. Both of them are likewiſe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Extent in the Matter before us; and both Subjects and Strangers are concerned in each. Tho' indeed, if we look ſtrictly into the Thing, and ſpeak more properly, the Good-Will ſeems to be the Quality of Subjects, and the Authority that which hath the Principal Influence upon
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53648:496"/>Strangers. And accordingly <hi>Tacitus</hi> diſtinguiſhes them, when he adviſes Perſons in this Eminent Poſt, to order Matters ſo,<note n="*" place="bottom">Amorem apud Populares, Metum apud Hoſtes quaerat.</note> 
                                    <hi>that their own Country-Men may be ſure to love, and Foreigners and Enemies may be ſure to fear them.</hi> And if we would deliver our Judgment freely and fully upon the Matter, though both are of great Efficacy, yet it muſt be acknowledged, that Authority is the ſtronger and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Principle of the Two; the more Venerable and of longer Continuance. But, when there is a juſt Temper, and exact Harmony of both together, this Matter is then brought to its utmoſt Perfection. A thing not always pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, becauſe the different Conſtitutions of Government, and yet more different Humors and Diſpoſitions of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to their ſeveral Climates, or Countries, or Complexions make a mighty Difference in the acquiring theſe; and incline Some to the One of thoſe Afflictions of the Mind, and Others to the other. So that ſome are eaſily brought to Love, and are ſcarce ſuſceptible of Fear; Others as eaſily awed into Reſpect, but not without infinite Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be won over to Kindneſs and Love for their Prince. What Methods are moſt Proper and Adviſable for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring both theſe Advantages, we have already been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; for the ſeveral Heads of Proviſion ſo largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, are but ſo many Means for the compaſſing this End: though of Them the moſt effectual and inſinuating ſeem to be Thoſe comprehnded under the Heads, which touch upon the Virtues, and the Manners or Deportment of a Prince. But however, it may not be amiſs, now we are fallen upon the Matter more directly, to ſay one Word or two more with regard to each of theſe powerful Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges expreſly.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Good-Will and Hearty Affection is of infinite and excellent Uſe; <note place="margin">Good Will acquir'd by Gentleneſs.</note> it is in a manner abſolutely neceſſary; in ſo much, that This by its own ſingle Strength is able to do a great deal, and gives amighty Security; but all the reſt without this is very ſeeble and unſafe. The Methods of obtaining it are principally Three. Firſt, Moderation and Gentleneſs; not in Words, and Actions, ſoft Language, and courteous Behaviour only, but alſo in the very Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Commands iſſued out, and the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the generality of Mankind are of ſuch a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as will neither endure to have their Hands ty'd behind
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53648:496"/>them, nor abſolutely looſe, and at their own diſpoſal.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nec totam ſervitutem pati, nec totam libertatem.</note>

He that will be well carried muſt take care not to ride with too ſtiff a Rein. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was very expert, and a perfect Maſter in Matters of this kind, uſed to ſay, that Power, when mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately exerciſed, kept all ſafe and tight; but when a Man once came to let himſelf looſe, and commanded things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the Reaſonableneſs or the Decency; when he was ſet upon making himſelf abſolute, and reſolv'd to be obey'd Right or Wrong; ſuch a One could never be belov'd by his Subjects, nor did he ſit faſt in his Throne. In the mean while, give me leave to add, that by this Gentleneſs and Moderation, I do not mean ſuch a tame and eaſie, Negligent and Effeminate Softneſs, as lets the Reins of Government perfectly looſe; For This will expoſe a Prince to Reproach and Contempt, and degenerate into an Extreme, Ten thouſand times worſe than that of Fear. In all theſe Caſes therefore a Commander muſt obſerve, how far he can go Decently,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sed incorrupto Ducis honore. <hi>Tacit.</hi>
                                    </note> and what Indulgences are conſiſtent with his Honour. And the proper Province as well as the Excellence and Commendation of Prudence in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nature will be, to make ſo juſt a Mixture of Juſtice and Gentleneſs, that a Prince may neither ſeek to be Fear'd by methods of Rigour and Extremity, and rendering himſelf a publick Terror to the World; nor ſtudy to ingratiate himſelf, and become Popular and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, by Methods ſo mean and unworthy, as ſhould make him Deſpicable, and a Jeſt and Scorn of the World.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Second Expedient, which I think adviſable for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affections of the World,<note place="margin">Beneficence.</note> is <hi>Beneficence:</hi> I mean ſo general and unbounded a Diſpoſition to do Good, as ſhall by no means be confin'd to thoſe of the firſt Quality, or near the Princes Perſon; but ſhed it ſelf all over, upon all Sorts and Conditions of Men, that even the loweſt and moſt diſtant, the meaneſt of the People, may taſt and rejoice in it. One excellent way of doing this, is by good Management, and provident Care; contriving ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and ſetting moderate Prices upon Commodities; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Markets be well furniſhed, and Corn and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neceſſaries for the ſupport of Life, ſold at reaſonable Rates; that if it be poſſible, there may always be Plenty, and whatever Nature cannot ſubſiſt without, may be cheap; for nothing is ſo ſneſible a Grievance as Scarcity, and extravagant Rates; and the Blame of all will be ſure to be laid at the Governour's Door. The Common People have no other Notion of publick Good, but what they are ſuſtain'd by; nor can you make them believe that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either Duty or Benefit, is incumbent upon, or to be expected from thoſe that ſit at Helm, comparable to That of ſeeding the Subject; as if Socity and Government were inſtituted for no other Purpoſe, than to ſee that the vulgar, and poorer ſort of Men ſhould never want a full Belly.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vulgo una ex Republicà Annonae cura.</note> And accordingly <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath obſerved, That the only Motive which can faſten their Affections to the State is the Convenience of being maintain'd at the publick Care.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Third Attractive of Peoples Affections is Liberality, which is in Truth a more particular Sort of Beneficence;<note place="margin">Liberality.</note> This is a Bait, nay, a Charm rather; for it does not only allure and invite, but draws, bewitches, captivates Mens Hearts, almoſt whether they will or no. So Pleaſant and Sweet it is to be on the Receiving, ſo Honourable and Winning to be on the Giving Hand: Inſomuch that a very wiſe Man laid it down for a Maxim, <hi>That a Government is better ſecured by Kindneſs, and Obligations, than by Strength and Force of Arms.</hi> This is an Expedition uſeful at all Times, but more eſpecially ſo, at the firſt entrance upon Government; when there hath been either ſome late Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or ſome new Eſtabliſhment.

I only add, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hath given us in his own Perſon, an eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, both of the Practice of theſe Methods for attaining the Love and Eſteeem of Mankind, and of the Succeſs of ſuch Meaſures<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui militem donis, populum annona, cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit.</note>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Authority is the other Pillar, that ſupports any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for,<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Majeſtas Imperii Salutis Tutela.</note> The <hi>Majeſty of the Royal Character is its Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Defence.</hi> This is that impregnable Fort,<note place="margin">Authority.</note> that keeps the lower and naked World in Aw; by Virtue whereof the Prince can demand, and force Satisfaction, form any who ſhall preſume to contemn his Orders, or behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſolently to him. Upon the Account of This it is, that the Diſcontents of People end in Murmurs, that the enraged Mobile dares not ſtorm the Palace, but all deſire to be in good Grace with their Great Maſter. Now, this Authority is a compounded thing, and the Two Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients that make it up, are Fear and Reſpect. By Theſe two the Prince and his Government become formidable, ſpread a ſort of Awe upon all who behold and conſider them, and are ſecured from Attempts by this Protection. Now, to the acquiting this Authority, beſides that all the Heads of Proviſion inſiſted upon in the laſt Chapter muſt concur, there are Three other Things abſolutely neceſſary to be obſerved, in the Admiſtration, and manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning it iſelf.</p>
                                 <p>The Firſt of Theſe is Severity; which, commonly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Severity.</note> is much more for the Safety, and Advantage of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and a better and more durable Defence from Enemies and Dangers, than Eaſineſs and Clemency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are ſo very ſeldom tempered with Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a great Softneſs and Gentleneſs of Diſpoſition is exceeding apt to degenerate, and, as was hinted before, to produce very miſchievous Effects. Of This ſeveral good Accounts may be given; As Firſt, the Natural Humor of the People, which, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> very truly obſerved, is not caſt in ſo good a Mould, as to be tractable; nor will they be contained in their Duty by any Principles ſo generous,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53648:498"/>as Love or Shame; nothing leſs, nothing better will do it than Force and Fear, Extremity, and a Dread at leaſt of Puniſhment. A Second Reaſon is the General Corruption of Manners, and that Extravagance and Debauchery, which like a Contagious Diſtemper, haith tainted and overſpread all the World; and this by being general, takes Courage, grows Inſolent and Preſumptuous; and is ſo far from any poſſibility of being reform'd by fair Means, that ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs only inflames the Diſeaſe, and makes Vice more Bold and Triumphant. It begets Contempt of Superiours, and ſtrengthens the Wicked with Hopes of Impunity, which is the Plague and Bane of all Law, and all Government. For as <hi>Ciccro</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Illecebra peccandi maxima ſpes impunitatis.</note> 
                                    <hi>The moſt Pewerful Temptation to offend ariſes from the Hope of Impunity.</hi> And moſt certain it is, that Rigor upon particular Notorious Offenders, is the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that can poſſibly be ſhewn to the Publick, and the whole Body of Subjects in general. There is ſometimes a neceſſity of making ſignal and ſolemn Examples, thus at the Expence of private Sufferings to teach other People Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to prevent the exorbitant Growth of Villany by cutting it ſhort betimes. The Body Politick is in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſubject to the ſame Dangers, and muſt ſubmit to the ſame Methods of Cure, with our Natural Body; where a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is many times taken off out of a mere Principle of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; that by this ſeeming Barbarity, a Mortification may be prevented from ſeizing the whole Arm firſt, and then the Vitals. And thus that King of <hi>Thrace</hi> made no ill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to one that reproach'd him, with playing the Part, not of a King, but a Mad-Man; <hi>Aye,</hi> Sir, ſays he, <hi>but this Madneſs of</hi> mine <hi>keeps my Subjects in their Senſes;</hi> and <hi>they grow Wiſer by that which you think my Folly.</hi> Severity keeps Officers and Magiſtrates ſtrictly to their Duty, and promotes a faithful Execution of their reſpective Truſts; it diſcountenances Flatterers, and turns Paraſites out of Doors; the Wicked and Diſſolute, the impudent Beggars, and little Tyrants of the Court are not able to ſtand before it. Whereas on the contrary, Eaſineſs and Exceſſive Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper opens the Gate Wide, and admits all theſe infamous Wretches; by whoſe Importunity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs the publick Treaſures are exhauſted, and ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away; All manner of Vice is encouraged, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is impoveriſhed; all which, and a great many other
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53648:498"/>Miſeries, like Colds and Catarrhes, in a Rheumatick and diſtempered Body, break the Conſtitution; and fall and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle like the Humours, upon the weakeſt Parts. The Good-Nature of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and the Licentiouſneſs of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had like to have loſt All, and were very near ruining the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and then the ſtrict Diſcipline of <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> firſt, and afterwards of <hi>Alexander</hi> reſtor'd, and made all whole again.</p>
                                 <p>But ſtill Extreams muſt be avoided; and the Severity I recommended ſhould be exerciſed with prudent Reſerve, and juſt Diſtinction: It muſt not be a thing of conſtant practice, but now and then, upon juſtifiable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Occaſions; and when it may be ſeaſonable and effectual. For the End of this Diſpenſation muſt always direct the Uſe of the Means; and the Deſign of all Rigour in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice is plainly This,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ut poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes.</note>

The Reaſon of which is, that the more Surpriſing and New any Impreſſions of this kind are, the more Strong, and Terrible and Awakening they are. But then all this is to be underſtood of common Caſes; for if Vice gather Strength, if the Proſelytes and Practiſers of it grow Numerous, and Reſolute, and Bold, In ſuch a Caſe Compaſſion is the greateſt Cruelty, Fire and Sword are then the only Remedies, and it is neceſſary to go thro' with the Cure. And whatever Imputations of a Bloody and Barbarous Temper may in ſuch Circumſtances be caſt upon a Prince, they are but the Effects of Ignorance and Unjuſt Cenſure; for here again it is in the State, as in theſe private Bodies of ours, where the<note n="†" place="bottom">Crudelem Medicum, intemperans aeger facit.</note> Extremity <hi>of a Diſeaſe and the ungovernableneſs of the Patient, forces the Phyſician to be cruel;</hi> and he would betray his Skill,

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Second Expedient for eſtabliſhing and preſerving a Princes Authority, <note place="margin">Conſtancy.</note> is Conſtancy. A Firmneſs, and Reſolv'd Temper of Mind, by which he keeps to his own Methods, treads the ſame Steps, and without any Fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or wanton Love of change, advances ſtill on, gets Ground upon his Subjects; and enforces a due Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of eſtabliſh'd Laws, and ancient Cuſtoms. To be continually Altering and Reviewing, Aboliſhing Old, and Enacting New, beſides, that it argues a weak and unſettled Mind, which never knows when things are well, nor where to fix; it does unavoidably leſſen a Prince in the Eye of the World, and derive a very mean Opinion, both upon his Perſon, and his Laws; nay, it expoſes both to publick Scorn and Contempt. Upon This Account wiſe Men have ever ſhew'd themſelves averſe to Change, and that to ſuch a Degree, as to diſſuade and forbid Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Laws and received Cuſtoms, even though they were to be chang'd for the better. For (beſides the Uncertainty and the Danger of ſuch Courſes, and that we know the worſt of what is practiſed now, but cannot foreſee the Conſequences of what was never yet try'd;) Take the Matter abſtractedly and by it ſelf, and it is certain, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of an old Law is always more inconvenient, and does greater Miſchief, than the Novelty of a thing intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in its Room can poſibly do Good. Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (as I have intimated in a former Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) Buſie Fellows and Reformers have all along been look'd upon as very ſuſpicious and dangerous People, and by all means to be diſcountenanced. And in truth nothing leſs than either evidence or abſolute neceſſity; or elſe as evident and very conſiderable Advantage to the Publick; and This a certain, and not merely a poſſible, or likely Conſequence of the Change can ever be Argument Strong and Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enough, for breaking in upon ancient Conſtitutions, and altering the Meaſures of any Government. And when ſuch cogent Motives as theſe are offer'd to perſuade it, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then there is mighty Caution and Diligence to be uſed; the Proceedings ought to be exceeding well adviſed; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Step taken warily and with Deliberation. All muſt not be done at a Puſh; but the Old laid aſide with decency and by degrees, and the New introduced as gently and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53648:499"/>as is poſſible. For in this above any other conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Affairs is that Proverb of<note n="*" place="bottom">Leniter &amp; lente.</note>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The Third Expedient for this purpoſe is to ſteer this Veſſel himſelf, and not truſt the Helmof Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any other Hand. My Meaning is, that the Honour and Power of iſſuing out Orders, and giving Commands, ſhould be reſerv'd to the Prince in Perſon; and no other act as Superintendent under him; That he ſhould give the laſt Determinations, and his Will be the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without referring all to his Counſel, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Them to act and order, as they think fit. For this will draw the Eyes, and the Reſpects of all his Subjects, and make them ſenſible, that all depends upon his Diſpoſal and good Pleaſure. The Sovereign, who gives away, tho' it be never ſo little of his Authority, is in Danger of loſing All; and will quickly grow inſignificant and deſpicable. For this Reaſon a Prudent King will be ſure never to raiſe any Subject too high, or make him extravagantly Great, or Wealthy above the Reſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Communis cuſtodia Principatûs, neminem unum magnum facere.</note> 
                                    <hi>The common Safeguard of the Government and Royal State, is to take Care, that no one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be made too big by the Favour of his Prince,</hi> ſays <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi> And if it happen that he find ſuch a one already made to his Hands, it is a Maxim in Politicks, to leſſen and lower him: But then that muſt be done ſlily and ſmoothly, by ſome Stratagem not eaſily ſeen through, and in the moſt gentle, inoffenſive, inſenſible Way that can be. Another Rule is, not to give Places of great Dignity and Importance, for Life; much leſs ſuffer them to be heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and deſcend in the ſame Family; nay, it is dangerous indeed to continue Theſe for any long Term of Years, leſt Men by this Means ſhould ſtrengthen their Party, and at laſt become a Match for their Maſter. And whoever ſhall conſult Hiſtories, both Ancient and Modern, and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Cauſes of Powerful Factions, and the moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and fatal Revolutions of States and Empires, will find the greateſt part of them owing to the Exorbitant Riches and Power of ſome over-grown Subject; or the Influence and Intereſt of ſome old and important Officer:

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Theſe are fair, <note place="margin">Againſt Tyranny.</note> and honeſt Means, agreable to Juſtice, becoming the Character of a Prince, and fit for him to uſe for the acquiring and ſupporting himſelf, bothin the Good Affections of the World, and in a Venerable Authority with them. Upon theſe Terms he may be loved and ſeared both; and ſo it is neceſſary he ſhould be. For though a convenient Mixture of theſe Two be deſirable and excellent; yet either of them ſingly, and deſtitute of the other, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſonable in its ſelf, nor any Security to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Upon which Account it is, that we deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor a Tyrannical Authority, a Fear abſolutely repugnant to, and deſtructive of Affection and Love, ſuch as reners the Perſon an Object of all Men's Hatred at the ſame time.<note n="†" place="bottom">Oderint dum metuant.</note> 
                                    <hi>Let them hate me, ſo they fear me,</hi> is a brutiſh and ſavage Declaration; no one that is really a Man, would be content with Power and Greatneſs at that Rate; and this Authority, if it be ſit to allow it ſo honourable a Name, is ſuch as Barbarous, and Arbitrary, and Wicked Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves; not by the Exerciſe, but by the Abuſe of their Power. The Qualities and Character of a good Prince and a Tyrant, have no manner of Reſemblance to one another. The Diſtance is ſo vaſt, the Diſparity ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that it is ſcarce poſſible for a Man not to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between them. In ſhort, they all turn at laſt upon theſe Two Points; One is, The obſerving the Laws of God and Nature, with a Religious Strictneſs, or the trampling both under Foot, with the greateſt Inſolence and Contempt. The other, making the publick Good and true Intereſt of one's Subjects the End and Meaſure of all one's Actions; or the making every Thing truckle to his own Will, and by every Action and Deſign ſerving and aiming at nothing elſe, but private Profit and Pleaſure. Now the Prince, who will anſwer his Character, and be what ſo glorious a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires, muſt conſtantly remember, that as it is the peculiar Happineſs and Prerogative of Power to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath a Mind to: So it is alſo the true Prerogative of the Will, and the moſt certain Mark of real Greatneſs, to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53648:500"/>have a Mind to ſuch things only as are Juſt, and Lawful, and becoming.<note n="*" place="bottom">Caeſari cum omnia licent, propter hoc minus licet.

                                    <hi>Caeſar</hi> (ſays <hi>Pliny</hi>) <hi>hath leſs in his Power than Common Men, upon this very account, that every thing is in his Power. For as it is a Happineſs to be able to do what you pleaſe, ſo it is true Greatneſs to will only ſuch things as you can do; or rather, indeed, to deſire and will no more than you ought to do;</hi> for in ſtrict ſpeaking, a Man can do no more than lawfully hemay do. The greateſt Misfortune that any Prince is capable of, is the being poſſeſſed with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his Will is his Rule; and that all that is poſſible, is lawful for him. As ſoon as ever he hath given way to this vile Imagination, his whole Temper and Manners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently grow corrupt, and from a good Man he is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a wicked Wretch, and a Monſter. Now this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion commonly inſinuates it ſelf by Sycophants and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites: Flattery infuſes and blows it up; for Perſons of that Dignity never want enough and too many, to preach up to them the Greatneſs of their Power, becauſe this is a pleaſing Doctrine, and tickles the Ear; but the Obligations of Duty carry a harſh and grating Sound; and there are few, but very few Servants ſo hardy in their Fidelity, as to entertain their Maſter upon this neceſſary Subject. But of all ſorts of Flattery. That is the moſt dangerous, when a Man flatters Himſelf. In other Caſes, a Man may ſtop his Ears againſt the treacherous Inſinuation; he may enjoyn Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, forbid all Diſcourſe of that kind, avoid the Preſence and Company of the nauſeous Wretches that uſe and hope to ingratiate themſelves by it: But when the Perſon who gives, and he who receives the Flattery, are one and the ſame, What ſhall he do, or whether ſhall he run from ſuch deſtructive Converſation? And therefore a Prince above all other People, is highly concern'd to deal honeſtly by himſelf; to decline and deſpiſe the fulſom and baſe Soothings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People, who hope to make their court this way; and eſpecially to be a ſevere Inquiſitor and Judge of his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and not to cajole himſelf into Ruine.</p>
                                 <p>After all that hath been ſaid, (and too much cannot be ſaid againſt Tyranny and Arbitrary Adminiſtration) it is neceſſary to add, that ſometimes ſuch critical Junctures of Affairs will happen, ſuch Intricacies and Perplexities in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53648:501"/>Buſineſs, with regard to Time, Perſon, Places, Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſome accidental Circumſtances; that a Prince will be driven to a neceſſity of doing ſome things, which at firſt view may look like Tyranny: As for inſtance; When the Matter depending before him, is the ſuppreſſing of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Tyranny; the Licentiouſneſs, I mean, of a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, hair-brain'd People, whoſe ungovernable Fury is the moſt abſolute, moſt deſtructive Tyranny in the World; Or when he is to break ſome cloſe Cabal, or powerful Faction of the Nobility, and Perſons of Wealth and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in their Country; Or when the publick Treaſures are reduced and waſted, the King driven to extreme Wants, and knows not where to furniſh himſelf with needful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and ſo is compelled for the Relief of the State in its preſent Exigency, to raiſe Moneys irregularly, and borrow from the Rich, by ſuch Loans as they are not perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with. Of theſe Extremities, and the Methods and Remedies proper for them, I have ſpoken formerly; and the only deſign of renewing the mention of them here, is to perſuade People to give the beſt and moſt favourable Interpretation to Caſes of neceſſity; and not immediately clamour againſt them, and repreſent them in their worſt and moſt odious Colours, but make all the Allowances they can bear. Much leſs ought we to miſconſtrue Severity upon particular Offenders, or eſteem the number of his Guards, or the Strength of his Forts, or the Majeſty, and Style-Imperial of his Commands to be Tyranny. For all theſe things are not only uſeful in a very high degree, but in ſome Circumſtances indiſpenſably neceſſary. And ſuch Authoritative Methods in Kings, are much better, and more deſirable, than the ſofteſt Entreaties, and kindeſt Careſſes of Tyrants.</p>
                                 <p>And thus I have repreſented the Two firm Supports of a Prince, and a State; and happy is it for Them, who know how to acquire, and to continue theſe Advantages to themſelves; and by ſo doing, effectually prevent the Two Contraries, which are the very Murderers and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Undoers of a Prince and Government, Hatred, I mean, and Contempt: Concerning which I beg the Readers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſay one Word, becauſe a brief Conſideration of them may be of ſome Service towards the preventing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending our ſelves from them.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Hatred then, which is the direct Contrary to Love and Good-will,<note place="margin">Hatrod.</note> is an obſtinate, wicked, perverſe Affection of the Mind, whereby the Subjects are violently prejudiced, and bitterly ſet againſt the Prince and his Government. This commonly ſprings either from ſome Apprehenſion of future Miſchiefs, or from a Deſire of revenging ſome paſt Injury; or elſe from a Reſentment compounded of both theſe together. When this Hatred is very rank and fierce, and when it ſpreads and grows Epidemical, the Danger is extremely great, and the Conſequence commonly fatal; and very ſeldom it is, that a Prince is able to ſtemm, or get over it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Multorum odiis nullae opes poſſunt reſiſtere.

You ſee then, how important, how neceſſary it is for a Prince to preſerve himſelf from ſuch a dangerous, ſuch an irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Miſchief; and the moſt likely Courſe that can be taken for this purpoſe, will be to avoid the two Extremes of Cruelty and Avarice, ſo directly oppoſite to that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Liberality, which were obſerv'd before to be the powerful Inſtruments, and moſt powerful Motives to gain the Kindneſs and good Affection of any People.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Firſt, he muſt by all means keep himſelf clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted from any baſe and barbarous Cruelty,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> ſuch as is a Blemiſh to his Character, ſcandalous, and abominable, and unbecoming his Grandeur: On the other Hand, let his Mind be ſtrongly armed by Clemency, the Reaſons and Neceſſity whereof have been ſhewn already, when we treated of the Virtues more peculiar to a Prince. But ſtill, in regard Publick Puniſhments are neceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; and theſe, even when moſt juſt, even when moſt neceſſary, carry ſome face and appearance of Cruelty, it concerns a Governour to carry himſelf very prudently in the management of this Matter; and perhaps there are not many Caſes which require more Dexterity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. And therefore I will preſume to venture at a little particular Advice upon this Occaſion. As firſt, Let him by no means be too eager and haſty in laying his Hand
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53648:502"/>upon the Sword of Juſtice; but ſhew, that he draws it meerly in his own Defence; and by his ſlowneſs to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd, and loathneſs to revenge, convince the World, that what he does of this kind, is the effect of meer Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſore againſt his Inclination.<note n="†" place="bottom">Libenter damnat, qui cito: ergo illi parſimonia etiam viliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Sanguinis.</note> 
                                    <hi>He that paſſes Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſpeedily, does it willingly, and with a Glee; whereas there is a Tenderneſs due, and a King ought to be very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving even of the worſt and vileſt Blood.</hi> Secondly, Let the Principle upon which he proceeds, be the Proſpect of the Publick Good; and let the making their Faults exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, and preventing the ſpreading and growth of it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and a Relapſe of the Sufferer himſelf, be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Puniſhment, rather than any thirſt of Vengeance, or a deſire to torment the guilty Perſon. Thirdly, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of this kind is neceſſary to be done, let it be put in execution with all poſſible Calmneſs and Temper. A King ſhould be like his Laws, cool and ſedare, void of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Paſſion; and therefore Anger, and Joy, and any other Emotion of the Soul is highly unbeſeeming; but if any Paſſion may be allowed, That of Pity is the only one, that can ſhew it ſelf with a good Grace upon theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Fourthly, Let the Execution be only what is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in ſuch Caſes; for the aggravating of the Pain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting new and more exquiſite Methods of Torment, are ſo many certain Marks of a cruel and remorſeleſs Mind. Fifthly, Let not the Prince have any hand in inflicting the Puniſhment, nor ſo much as be preſent at the Execution; for this looks like inſulling, and taking ſatisfaction in the Sufferings of the Criminal. Laſtly, if there be a neceſſity of Puniſhing a great many, let it be done with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed, upon all together, that it may be over and forgotten, as ſoon as poſſible. For the prolonging their Execution, and repeating theſe Tragical Sights One by One, looks as if a Man play'd the <hi>Epicure</hi> in Blood. For we naturally contrive, that thoſe things may be lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, or often renewed to us, which give us Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Delight. And every Body haſtens to make an End of That, which is diſagreeable, and raiſes his Averſion.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> The next thing which he ought to keep himſelf free from, <note place="margin">Avarice.</note> is Avarice, than which no Vice whatſoever can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be more misbecoming a great Man Now this may diſcover it ſelf two Ways; either in Extortion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting more than is fit; or in Niggardlineſs, and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſs than is fit. The former of Theſe will be ſure to diſguſt the Common People, who are all of them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally covetous, and eſteem their Pocket the tendereſt Part; for Money is their Blood, their Life, their very Soul. And therefore nothing gives them ſo ſenſible an Affliction, or raiſes their Indignation, like the Exactions that rob them of it. The Second diſcontents all that have ſerved the State, who have any Pretenſions to Merit, and have ſpent their Time and Pains, their Strength and Blood, upon the Publick, and therefore think ſome proportionable Gratuity their due. Now we have already taken Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the laſt Chapter, to diſcourſe the matter of the Publick Treaſure at large, how the Prince ought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage himſelf in this whole Point; what Methods are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the raiſing of Funds; what Taxes fit to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the putting his Exchequer into Stock; what Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is requiſite in the laying out ſuch Moneys; and what Frugality neceſſary for the reſerving a convenient Supply for extraordinary Exigencies. And therefore all I ſhall need to add here, is only thus much, That the Prince ought very diligently to beware of Three Things. The Firſt, That he bear no manner of Reſemblance to thoſe Tyrannical and Extravagant Impoſitions, the inſupportable Burden whereof have rather made the Leviers of them Devourers of their Country, and common Plunderers, than Fathers and Defenders of it.

The Second Thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, is Sordidneſs, and that firſt in the gathering part;

The other Branch of Sordidneſs is in being cloſe-handed, giving nothing, or giving in little and ſneaking Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; making his Favours mercenary, or being ſlow and difficult in granting; ſo that whatever is obtain'd ſhall be dear bought, by importunate Requeſts, and long Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and is not ſo properly the effect of Generoſity, or a Senſe of Merit in the Receiver, as extorted by dunning, and wreſted out of his Hands by tiring and vanquiſhing his Patience. The Third is, Methods of Violence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Exaction in the levying of Taxes; when the manner of bringing it in, looks more like forraging, or going to plunder an Enemy, than to make a Demand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Subject. This Caution, I confeſs, is chiefly aim'd at the Inſolence of Collectors and Receivers, who by their baſe Extortions, and grinding the Faces of the Poor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Prince to Hatred and Diſrepute, and breed angry Reſentments, and ill Blood in the People. For his Honour ſuffers for the Miſdemeanors of his Under-Officers. Theſe Monſters of Foxes and Wolves, who as one deſcribes them, have Six Hands, and Three Heads apiece. And, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matters, ſo particularly in that of making Seiſures, are barbarous and remorſeleſs; eſpecially ſuch Goods as are Neceſſaries of a Man's Life, the Tools of his Trade, or Inſtruments of Husbandry; a Method to be declin'd in common Prudence, as exceeding odious, and what nothing leſs than Extremity, or very juſt Provocation ought to put them upon. It is therefore of mighty conſequence to a Prince, what ſort of People are employ'd in theſe Offices; for it is highly requiſite they ſhould be Men both of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Prudence: Nor is it leſs Neceſſary for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to turn them out with Diſgrace when they misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves: A ſevere exemplary Puniſhment, a ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fine, to make them diſgorge all their ill-gotten Gains, is what he owes to himſelf, and his own Defence: For
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53648:503"/>theſe State-Sponges ſhould be uſed accordingly, and ſqueez'd in their Turn too, till they have given back every Drop of that Blood and Sweat, which they moſt mercileſly ſuckt up, by draining and ſqueezing the poor Country People before.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Let us now proceed to conſider that other, and, if it be poſſible, ſtill worſe Enemy of a Prince and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Contempt.</note> which is Contempt, ariſing from an ill and mean Opinion both of the One and the Other. What is it that can poſſibly ſupport one ſingle Man, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of great Years and Infirmities, in a Station ſo much above many Millions of his Brethren, except it be Authority, and a high Eſteem? When once This is loſt, and ſinks into Contempt, all the reſt is loſt with it, and both Prince and Government fall to the Ground. And therefore, as in this reſpect, according to what was urged before, Authority is of greater Strength and Efficacy, and carries more Pomp and Majeſty with it, than the good Affection of a People; ſo likewiſe Contempt is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and formidable, than even Hatred it ſelf. For Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is Modeſt and Timorous, it is reſtrain'd by Fear, and dares attempt nothing, till Contempt let it looſe; but this ſhakes off that Yoke, animates and arms it for the moſt deſperate Undertakings. It is true indeed, Contempt ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom riſes very high, eſpecially under the Government of a Rightful Prince, unleſs he be perfectly inſignificant, and degrade and proſtitute himſelf and his Honour to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as only to be<note n="*" place="bottom">Ut videatur exire de imperio.</note> 
                                    <hi>a King of Clouts.</hi> But ſtill, ſince there is a poſſibility of its happening, we ſhall do well to obſerve what are the Occaſions moſt likely to produce it. Now This, as it is in its own Nature the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to Authority, ſo does it derive it ſelf from Cauſes directly contrary to Thoſe, by virtue whereof a Prince's Authority is procured and preſerved: As for Inſtance, thoſe Three that follow.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, as to his manner of Government; a looſe, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſoftneſs, ſupineneſs, and negligence in Buſineſs; a tame, heedleſs, unthinking Temper; or elſe Fickleneſs in his Reſolution, and perpetual Change and Uncertainty in his Opinions and Methods: For when there is no Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Steadineſs, no Spirit or Vigor, this is the mere empty Name of a Government, without the Thing. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53648:504"/>under ſuch Princes grow inſolent, and bold, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching: They think they may do what they will, and that He will never regard, or reckon with them for it:<note n="†" place="bottom">Malum, principem habere, ſub quo nihil ulli licet; pejus, eum, ſub quo omnia omnibus.</note> 
                                    <hi>It is a great Calamity to have a Prince, under whom no Man enjoys any Liberty at all; but it is ſtill greater to have one, under whom none are ſubject to any Check or Reſtraint at all.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, This is frequently the Effect of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, either with regard to his Affairs when they ſucceed ill; Or in reſpect of his Family, when there is no certain proſpect of Succeſſion, either of his own Iſſue, or elſe by a fixt Settlement; for Children are a mighty ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Prince's Intereſt; and the not knowing what will become of the Crown when the preſent Poſſeſſor fails, is ſuch a Diminution and Unhappineſs, that we find even <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, in the midſt of Glory and Conqueſt, complaining bitterly of it;<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Orbitas mea, quod ſine liberis ſum, ſpernitur.

                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Princes often draw Contempt upon themſelves by their Manners, and way of Living, particularly, if they be diſſolute and debauch'd, ſenſual and effeminate; Slaves to Vice, and abandon'd to Luxury and Pleaſure; eſpecially to Sottiſhneſs, and Drinking, and Gluttony, the loweſt and moſt deſpicable of all Pleaſures: Alſo their Behaviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to it, if this be churliſh and moroſe; their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when childiſh and impertinent; their Perſons, when nauſcous and notoriouſly deform'd.</p>
                                 <p>And thus we are got to the End of what I thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be premiſed, with relation to the Active part, or Adminiſtration of a Prince in general. We proceed now to handle it more diſtinctly and particularly. But in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereunto, it muſt be remembred, that this (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the beginning of this Chapter) conſiſts of Two parts, the One Civil, or that which concerns a State of Peace and publick Tranquillity. The Other Military, and proper for a State of War: For by the former I underſtand the common and ordinary Methods of Goverment, which are of conſtant
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53648:504"/>and daily uſe, whether in a time of Peace or War. By the Latter I mean thoſe Methods which are proper to Martial Diſcipline, and the practice whereof is peculiar to the Time of War only.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The peaceful and ordinary Adminiſtration of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Province of ſuch vaſt Comprehenſion, <note place="margin">The Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</note> and the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Occurrences of it ſo various and unforeſeen, that it is impoſſible to reduce it to any general Rules. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, The Prudence of it conſiſts oftentimes as much in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to act, as at other times in acting. But however, I will venture to lay down here ſome few Heads of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which are neceſſary to be conſider'd, and may be of ſome Advantage perhaps, when the Duties they preſcribe are obſerv'd duly, and improv'd, by applying the Subſtance of thoſe general Intimations to particular Actions and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Firſt then, the Prince is concern'd above all things, to take care, that he be faithfully and diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of all Matters which any way concern him to know. The Matters I mean here may be comprehended under Two Heads; and conſequently the Informations themſelves, and the Perſons made uſe of in them, are of two different Qualities. And to render thoſe of each ſort what they ought to be, theſe Qualifications are abſolutely neceſſary, and in common to both; Sincerity and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Secreſie and Prudence. But tho' theſe be requiſite to both kinds, yet they are not ſo to both equally: For the One have occaſion for much greater Liberty, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penneſs, and Plain-dealing, than the Other. The One of theſe are the Perſons whoſe buſineſs it is to put him in Mind of his Duty, what he is obliged to, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Character; and not only ſo, but to make him duly ſenſible of his Faults and Failings, and to ſpeak bold Truths to him concerning himſelf. There are no ſort of Men in the World, who ſtand in ſo great need of ſuch Friends, as Princes do; For they have no Senſes of their own, nor any other Direction, but what is receiv'd from ſeeing with other People's Eyes, and hearing with other People's Ears. They ſuſtain a publick Character, and have a World of People to ſatisfie; ſo that every Word and Action of Theirs is the Matter of Cenſure or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and expos'd to the critical Malice of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And, as they have in this reſpect more Humours to pleaſe, ſo are they leſs capable of doing it than common Men, becauſe they are induſtriouſly kept in the Dark; and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53648:505"/>very little of what concerns them is ſuffer'd to come to their Knowledge. And thus for want of better Inſtruction, they do things which prove inconvenient and diſguſting; and ſo, with all the undeſigning Innocence imaginable, expoſe themſelves to the Hatred and Reſentments of their Subjects. All which had certainly been prevented, or very eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd, had they been fairly and freely dealt with in time. But then it muſt be ſaid, on the other hand, that they are in ſome degree deſtin'd to this Ignorance, or accountable for it Themſelves; becauſe Matters are ſo order'd, that Frankneſs of Humour, and Home-Truths by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or Reproof, (tho' the beſt Offices, and ſureſt Marks of Friendſhip and Affection) are yet ſeldom well taken; and eſpecially to Princes they are not only unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, but ſometimes extremely dangerous to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath Courage and Houeſty enough to venture at them. And yet this cannot in reaſon but appear a very criminal Nicety, and an Argument of great Weakneſs; when ſuch Perſons cannot bear having their Ears grated, and made to glow a little, for their Good: For this Harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sound is all they can endure; They are above Compulſion or Reſtraint; and have the whole Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves left ſtill entirely in their own Diſpoſal.</p>
                                 <p>The Other ſort of Informers are ſuch as are employ'd to bring what we properly call Intelligence; by repreſenting all the conſiderable Actions and Occurrences, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs of his Dominions, and by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but by diſcovering the Projects and Intrigues of neighbouring Courts: I ſay of All that is doing at Home or Abroad, wherein either his Own, or his Allies, or Borderer's Government is either immediately, or but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely concern'd. Theſe Two diſtinct kinds of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do in ſome degree anſwer the Character of thoſe two Friends to <hi>Alexander, Hepheſtion</hi> and <hi>Craterus.</hi> One of which is ſaid to have loved the King, and the other <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> That is, One of them was fond of his Perſon, the Other of his Government; One regarded him in his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, the Other in his Publick Capacity;<note n="*" place="bottom">The Deſcription given of this perſonal Dearneſs betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> hath that among other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances mention'd in it. <hi>Secretorum omnium arbiter; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis quoque in admonendo non alius jus habebat.</hi> Qu.

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> In the Second place, The Prince ſhould always have by him a private Book of <hi>Memorandums,</hi> conſiſting principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Three Heads. Firſt, An Abridgement of all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Publick Concern then depending: That by recourſe to This, he may imform himſelf at one View, what is fit to be done in the preſent Juncture of Affairs; what Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are already in Motion, and want to be compleated; that ſo every thing may be attended to in its proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and nothing done out of time, or by halves. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a Liſt of Perſons Names, whoſe Merits may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to his Favour, either upon the Account of paſt Services, which call for Rewards and Gratifications; or of extraordinary Abilities, which qualifie them for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments and Places of Truſt. The Third, A Memorial of Gifts and Grants already conferred, to whom, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Conſiderations: For without a diſtinct and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of theſe Three things, it is ſcarce poſſible to avoid the being frequently at a loſs, and making a great many falſe Steps. And accordingly we find, that Princes of the juſteſt Renown, and moſt celebrated in Story for their Wiſdom and Policy, have conſtantly taken this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and felt the Convenience of it; as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> (for inſtance) <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and the <hi>Antonines.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> A Third Rule may be This; That in regard One of the moſt material Parts of the Royal Character conſiſts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the deſerts of Men, and aſſigning Rewards and Puniſhments accordingly; and in conſideration, That the One of theſe is extraordinary graceful, and recommends him to their Affection; The Other naturally diſguſting, and what will be ſure to draw a great Odium upon the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: Therefore the Diſtribution of Rewards thou'd be reſerved to himſelf. Honours and Eſtates, Offices and Preferments, Privileges and Penſions, Exemptions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, Reſtitutions and Pardons; and, in a word, every thing of Grace and Favour ſhould come immediately from his own Hand: But every thing that is grievous and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſhould be turn'd over to ſome other Hand: And therefore inferior Officers are more properly made uſe of, for pronouncing Sentences of Condemnation, impoſing Fines, levying of Forfeitures, making Diſtreſſes, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all manner of Penalties: For tho' it be true, that all Matters of this Nature depend upon the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and it is virtually the Prince that does them; yet
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53648:506"/>it is certain from Experience, and the common Senſe of Mankind, that This is not ſo duly conſider'd, but that it leaves a particular Grudge behind, and creates angry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments againſt that very Perſon, who is the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Actor, tho' he be in reality never ſo paſſive in the thing.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> In the Diſtribution of Rewards and Gratuities, and other Marks of Favour of the like Nature, this farther Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may not be unſeaſonable. That a Prince, upon ſuch Occaſions, ſhould ſhew himſelf forward and free; he ſhould if it be poſſible, even prevent the Receiver's Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and give unasked; and not defer the matter ſo long, till he bring himſelf under a neceſſity of denying any Applications made to him for them: He ſhould likewiſe give in Perſon, when that can be done conveniently; or order them to be given in his Preſence, and with ſome particular Expreſſions of his Favour and Eſteem. For all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are wonderfully engaging; they add to the intrinſick value of the Gift; make it more welcome, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to all the purpoſes it can be capable of ſerving. Beſides, that in obſerving this Method, Two mighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences will be avoided, which do really diminiſh in a great meaſure, if not quite, defeat abſolutely the Acknowledgments due to Perſons of Honour and Deſert; One is that of a tedious Attendance; the Difficulty and intollerable Expence they are forced to be at, in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantages which are really intended them, and thought to be very juſtly conferred; and This to Men of Eminence and Spirit, is a great Grievance, and grates very hard. The Other is, That after the Prince hath actually beſtowed the Gift, and declared his Pleaſure in it, the Forms of the Grant, and the Delays and indirect Dealings of the Officers, thro' whoſe Hands it muſt paſs, do ſo inflame the Reckoning, that before a Man can be diſpatched, and come into actual Poſſeſſion of his own, it coſts him at leaſt half what the thing is worth; nay, ſometimes the full value, or more; and when all Charges come to be computed, he hath the Name only, but receives nothing; or ſomething he had better have been without, than have ſpent his Intereſt, and Money, and Time, for that which turns to ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor Account.</p>
                                 <pb n="415" facs="tcp:53648:506"/>
                                 <p> We come now to that part of the Adminiſtration, which is Military: and This every Man eaſily ſees to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Defence and ſupport both of Prince and People, and preſerving the Order and Honour of any Government. And therefore I ſhall treat of it with all the Brevity that the Subject will bear. Now, the whole of what is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be ſaid upon it, may be reduc'd to Three Heads; The engaging in a War at firſt, the Carrying it on when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and the Putting an End to it.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. For the engaging in a War, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Two Preliminaries are Neceſſary,<note place="margin">Of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> Juſtice and Prudence, and conſequently the Two Vices oppoſite to Theſe by all Means to be avoided, which are Injuſtice and Raſhneſs. Firſt of all, It is neceſſary that the War be Juſt; for Juſtice ought to march in the Head, and lead Courage on to Actions; as Counſel and Deliberation ought to go before the Execution of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. And therefore ſuch Maxims as theſe, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in every Bodies Mouth, are yet moſt Wicked and Abominable; That Right is always on the ſtrongeſt Side; That the Succeſs will determine the Cauſe; That the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sword will carry it. For certainly the Goodneſs of any Cauſe is not to be meaſur'd by the Event, but by the Equity and the Reaſonableneſs, that is at the Bottom of it. And though War be a Thing of Violence and Force, and the Deciſions of it very diſtant from the Method of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining civil Controverſies; yet even War it ſelf is not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Lawleſs, but hath its Rules and Meaſures to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; as well as Peace. Almighty God, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Lord of Hoſts, and God of Battles, does favour juſt Wars in a peculiar Manner; it is He, who diſpoſes of Victories, and caſts the Scale, as he in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſees fit. But it is the Duty of every Prince to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie himſelf for that Favour; and, as much as may be, to engage Providence on his Side; and the firſt of thoſe Qualifications, is the Juſtice of the Undertaking. To pick Quarrels therefore, and<note n="*" place="bottom">Non ex omni occaſione quaerere triumphum.</note> 
                                    <hi>commence a War upon every Occaſion, is what can never be anſwered.</hi> The Itch of Honour and Triumph will bear no Monarch out in it. And therefore ſuch ought to take good Heed, that Ambition, and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and Paſſion, be not too buſie upon theſe Occaſions; which yet, if a Man may be allowed to ſpeak the Truth freely are, it is to be feared, the great Incendiaries of the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53648:507"/>World, and generally at the Bottom of ſuch Undertakings.<note n="†" place="bottom">Una &amp; ea vetus cauſa bellandi eſt profunda cupido Imperii &amp; divitiarum; maximam gloriam in maximo Imperio putant. Rupere foedus impius lucri furor &amp; ira praeceps.</note> 
                                    <hi>One, and that indeed the unuſual and ancient Cauſe of War is the inſatiable Thirſt of Riches and Dominion; That Abyſs of Avarice and Ambition, which meaſures the Greatneſs of a Prince's Glory by the Extent of his Territories, and Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Conqueſt. The Raging Deſire of Gain, and the Raſh Heat of Anger are the Diſturbers of Peace, and Violaters of Leagues and Treaties.</hi>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Now, to make a War juſt, and in all Points what it ought to be,<note place="margin">A juſt War, what.</note> Three Things muſt concur: The Firſt, That it be denounced, and undertaken, why a Perſon, who hath the Power of making and proclaiming it; which can only be the Sovereign himſelf; or in Common-Wealths, thoſe who are inveſted with the Suprme Authority, and whom the Law in that reſpect looks upon, but as one ſingle Perſon.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> The Second is, That the Cauſe, upon which it is ſo denounc'd be juſt; and ſuch without all Diſpute, is the Caſe of a Defenſive War; the Light of Reaſon clearly and conſtantly pronounced in Favour of ſuch a War in the Judgment of all the Wiſe and civiliz'd Part of Mankind; and Neceſſity ſupply'd the Place of Argument and Thought, and moved the Barbarous and Ignorant, to agree in the Juſtification of it too; Cuſtom hath made this Opinion and Practice univerſal among Men; and Nature her ſelf hath infus'd this Principle into Brutes. But then by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, I mean, That which is truly and properly ſo; when Life, or Liberty, one's Relations, or one's Country are aſſaulted. Nay, not only ſo, but a War is really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, when begun in behalf of our Confederates and Allies, or to chaſtiſe Breach of Faith and former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, or for the Protection and Redreſs of thoſe that are oppreſſed Grievouſly, and injuriouſly treated.

And accordingly we often ſee, that One Hour there turns the whole Face of Affairs, and exalts or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Prince to the very Reverſe of what he was an Hour ago.

                                 <p> The Third Conſideration neceſſary upon this Occaſion is, That of the horrible Grievances and Hardſhips, the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Miſeries, which War (ſuppoſing the very beſt of the Event and ſinal Determination) does unavoidably draw both upon the Publick in general, and private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in particular. And theſe indeed, when duly reflected upon, are ſuch, that the very Thought alone is Diſmal and full of Diſcouragement and Horror.</p>
                                 <p>A Fourth Reſlection will concern the Slanders and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, the Reproaches and Curſes, which are ſure to light upon the Authors and firſt Beginners of any War. For the Misfortunes and Loſſes, which cannot but happen, will be ſure to alienate the Affections, and provoke the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of thoſe who ſuffer under them; and they, when thus incenſed, will not fail to expreſs thoſe Reſentments, in a very plentiful and bitter Manner: For, from what hath been ſaid already, we may eaſily be convinced, that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lies more expoſed to the Tongues and Cenſures of the World, than War. And whoever is the Immediate Actor of the Miſchief, the main Burden will be ſure to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principla.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iniquiſſima Bellorum conditio haec eſt; Proſpera omnes ſibi vendicant, Adverſa uni imputantur.</note> 
                                    <hi>This,</hi> ſays <hi>Tacitus, is the particular Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of War, that Men always make an unjuſt Diviſion of Events; all that ſucceeds well, every Man arrogates to himſelf; but all the Miſcarriages and Loſſes, every one Shifts off from himſelf, and all agree to lay the Load at the Principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders Door only.</hi> Thoſe that fail in Execution, blaim them whoſe Buſineſs it is to give Orders; and they who iſſue Orders, lay the Blame upon Negligence and Failure in the Execution; and, at the laſt Rebound, the Whole reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince himſelf. Upon all theſe Accounts the very juſteſt War, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, is odious and deteſtable; and a Prince does very ill, and Acts imprudently, when he engages in it, without extremely urgent Neceſſity. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Remark made upon <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar:</hi> And therefore Kings muſt not ſuffer themſelves to be won over to it, by thoſe buſie Incendiaries that ſet the World on Fire, and deſire to incenſe their Maſter with groundleſs Jealouſies, or allure him with imaginary Conqueſt, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gratifie ſome particular Paſſion of their own.

The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Proviſions and Strengthenings for War are Three: Firſt, Money; which is the very Life and Spirits, the Nerves and Sinews of War; as hath been already ſhewed at large. Secondly, Arms Offenſive and Defenſive, which have alſo been ſpoken to before: Theſe two are of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe, and what a Prince ſhould always have plenty of in Reſerve. The Third is Victuals; without which an Army can neither conquer, nor ſight, nor live; if This be wanting, Engagements are needleſs, for your Men are cut off without ever a Blow ſtruck; and the Soldiers grow wild and unruly, and cannot poſſibly be kept under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſciplinam non ſervat jejunus Exercitus.</note>

And here we ſhall be obliged to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between them. As firſt of all, between Private Soldiers, or thoſe who are commonly ſaid to carry Arms; and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, or Perſons in Commiſſion. The Private Soldiers are the Body, the Officers the Head, or Life of the Army; That which inſpires and directs every Motion, and by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof they act. Now here, we will firſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the common Soldiers, who make the Bulk and main Subſtance of the Army. Of theſe there be ſeveral ſorts, ſome Foot, and others Horſe; ſome Natives, others Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſome the ſtanding proper Force of the Government, others Auxiliary Troops, or ſuch as are levied upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Emergency. We ſhall do well to take a tranſient view
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53648:510"/>of every one of theſe, and beſtow the Pains of comparing them a little together; that ſo we may be ſatisfied which are beſt and moſt eligible: And then we will proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve, what Methods are to be made uſe of for the directing and governing our Choice; and what laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ordering and well-diſpoſing them, when thus levied, and got together.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Now, the Judgments of Men have been very different in the firſt Branch of this Compariſon.<note place="margin">Foot.</note> For ſome, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Barbarous and Undiciplined Nations are much more for Horle than Foot; but others are generally of the quite contrary Opinion. Indeed it may with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be affirmed, that if both are conſidered ſimply, and abſolutely without any regard to particular Exigences and Qualifications, Foot are much the better of the Two, For they are of Service all along, and run through the whole Courſe of the War; no place excludes them, no Action is atchieved without them. Whereas the Horſe are often uſeleſs; for in Mountainous and rough Countries, and where the Defiles are very ſtraight, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging and taking of Towns, they ſtand a General in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ſtead. Foot are alſo more ready at Hand upon all occaſions; they cannot lie far out of Call; and, as their Attendance and Service is more, ſo the Expence of raiſing and maintaining them, is conſiderably leſs. The Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Equipage of Horſe is extremely Chargeable; and even for That Action, where they are of moſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Flanking and Galling the Enemy in a Battle, if the Foot be well appointed, armed Subſtantially, and Skilful in their Buſineſs, they will ſtand the Shock, and maintain their Poſt very well. And accordingly, Thoſe who ſet up for Maſters in this Art, uſually give them the Preference. The Horſe indeed are of greater uſe in a pitch'd Battle, and for making quick Work.<note n="*" place="bottom">Equeſtrium virium proprium eſt citò parare, citò cedere victoriam.</note> 
                                    <hi>For this</hi> (ſays one) <hi>is the Quality of Horſe, that they ſoon get, and ſoon loſe the Day.</hi> The Foot, it is plain, cannot be ſo good at diſpatch; nor can it be expected they ſhould. But then they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends another way, and as they are the ſlower, ſo they are a great deal the ſurer of the Two.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Nor do we find an entire Agreement of Opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the next Article; <note place="margin">Natives.</note> Whether Natives or Strangers are ſitteſt to be made uſe of; tho' to me the Odds appear
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53648:510"/>ſo very great, that I make no manner of difficulty to give it on the Native's ſide. For certainly, we may expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Principles, and greater Fidelity from Home-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, than we can from Strangers, who are Soldiers of Fortune, and only fight for their Pay. They will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure more, be better contented, ſubmit more quietly to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, carry themſelves with more Reſpect to their Officers, uſe more Civility in Quarters, will think their Honour more concerned; and when they come to Action, ſhew more Courage in the Engagement, as they cannot but have a more affectionate and tender Regard to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the defence whereof they are engaged. Beſides, the Publick ſaves more by them; they coſt a great deal leſs; and are more ready at hand than Auxiliaries from Abroad. For Foreigners are very often mutinous and grumbling; and that ſometimes, juſt when there is occaſion to make uſe of them: They commonly keep a great bluſtering, but have more of Inſolence and Vanity, than of real Service in them: They are generally Troubleſome, and a Burden to the Publick; cruel and oppreſſive to poor Country People, and fancy themſelves licenſed to plunder, as if it were an Enemy's Country, becauſe it is none of their own. Then the Expence of Tranſporting them backward and forward, the Voyages by Sea, or long Marches by Land, are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Charge. And, which is worſt of all, their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are frequently ſo tedious, and their Delays ſo many, that Opportunities are loſt, incredible Damage ſuſtained, and the Seaſon of Action quite ſpent, before they come up. This, I ſay, is very often the Caſe, and therefore where Natives are equally qualify'd in other reſpects, and there is no want of Hands, theſe are certainly ſitteſt to be employed. But ſtill This hinders not but that there may be occaſions, in which a Foreigner's Aid is adviſable, and therefore this ſtaring of the Compariſon is not to be lookt upon as a concluſive Rule, nor of any force againſt Caſes of Neceſſity, or particular Convenience. But even then, it will be for the ſafety of a Prince, to take heed that the Strangers do not exceed thoſe of his own Subjects; for though they may conſtitute a Part or Limb of the Army, yet they muſt by no means make up the main Body of it: For when once they feel themſelves ſuperiour, or but an equal Match for the Natives, there is danger of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of ſuch an Advantage, to ſubdue and make a Prey of their Maſters that hired them. And Hiſtory takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53648:511"/>of this Trick being play'd ſo often, that no prudent Governour would run the riſque of it, or put ſuch a Game into Strangers Hands. And a fair Game to be ſure it is; for He that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Firſt,</hi> The place of their Nativity and Dwelling, and the manner of their Education ſuitable to it: For they ſhould be taken principally out of the Country, from mountainous, barren, and rugged Situations, or elſe from Sea-Coaſts; in all which places People are uſually brought up to all ſorts of Labour and hard Fare. So ſays <hi>Vegetius,</hi>
                                    <note n="*" place="bottom">Ex Agris ſupprendum praecipuè robur exercitûs; aptior Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis Ruſtica plebs, ſub dio &amp; in laboribus enutrita; ipſo terrae ſuae ſolo &amp; coelo acrius animantur.</note> 
                                    <hi>The Levies ought chiefly to be made out of the Country; for ſuch Men will be a Strength indeed: They are fitter to bear Arms, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed to endure all manner of Weather, and to live by Drudgery. Their very Soil and Climate hardens and gives them Courage. And the leſs eaſie and delightful any Man's Life hath been, the leſs he will be afraid to die.</hi> But now your People in Cities and great Towns are more nice and tender; they run to cool and artificial Shades, and know not what it is to endure either a ſcorching Sun, or a cold Winter Blaſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Pleaſure are all They are intent upon; and this makes them ſoft, and idle, and effeminate.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vernacula multitudo, laſciviae ſueta, laborum intolerans.</note>

                                    <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Age of the Men is of great conſequence; for the beſt Seaſon of taking them is in their Youth; about Eighteen or Twenty Years old, when they have not only Vigour and Strength, but are teachable and pliant, fit to learn, as well as able to perform their Duty. For Vice and Stubbornneſs grows upon them with Years: There is ſcarce any reforming old Fellows; the bad Habits of their former Days ſtick by them; and beſides, they are ſo Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and Self-conceited, that it is next to impoſſible to bend them to Inſtruction and Diſcipline.</p>
                                 <pb n="427" facs="tcp:53648:512"/>
                                 <p> A <hi>Third</hi> Conſideration is their Body; which, according to the Opinion of ſome, ought to be very tall; and thus <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> particularly deſired their Soldiers.

                                 <p>In the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, They ſhould look out for Men of lively Tempers, brave and reſolute Spirits, bold and daring, and valuing themſelves upon their Abilities; ſuch as are greedy of Praiſe; impatient to be out-done, and afraid of nothing ſo much as Diſhonour and Reproach.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Their Condition is likewiſe of very great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For thoſe that are the very Lees and Dregs of the People, of a ſcandalous Character, or brought up in Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Infamy; or ſuch as have follow'd lazy and ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Trades, or never knew any Buſineſs but following Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Women: In a Word, All manner of ſauntring and diſgraceful Proſeſſions, render a Man extremely unfit for This, which muſt engage him in Activity, and all manner of Hardſhip.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> The next thing after the making a good Choice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Men for our purpoſe, <note place="margin">Diſcipline.</note> is to qualifie them for Service by good Diſcipline. For it is by no means enough, that Perſons capable of making good Soldiers are procurd of that Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be not improv'd, and they actually made ſuch; and to as little effect is it, that they are once made ſo, except they be kept ſo by habitual Practice afterwards. There are but very few Men in the World, who are valiant merely from Nature and Diſpoſition; for, generally ſpeaking, Courage is owing to Inſtruction and Art, to Cuſtom and Diſcipline. And theſe things are of ſo exceeding great importance in War, that the Uſes and Advantage of them are never to be expreſs'd. Good Diſcipline is really All in All. It is to This, that old <hi>Rome</hi> was indebted for all her Glories; This ſecur'd and enlarg'd her Conqueſts, and made her Miſtreſs of the World; all which that People were ſo ſenſible of,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53648:513"/>that no one Virtue whatſoever, not even natural Affection to their own Children, was reputed more neceſſary, or had in higher Eſteem. Now the main Point of Diſcipline is Obedience; and that old Rule expreſſes this Matter very truly and well, which ſays, That a Soldier ought always to be more afraid of his Officer than his Enemy.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Now ther are two great Ends, <note place="margin">Two Parts.</note> which this Diſcipline ſhould aim at, which are, making good Soldiers, and good Men; and conſequently, it muſt needs conſiſt of two parts; one of which reſpects the Valour, the other the Virtue or Manners of the Perſons concern'd to be kept under it. For the promoting of Valour, and perfecting them in the Buſineſs of their Profeſſion, Three Things are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
                                 <p>

                                    <note place="margin">Exercitus</note> Now this is properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them how to handle their Arms, and be expert in the uſe of them upon all occaſions; to prepare for, and by juſt degrees advance to Action; to ſhoot and draw regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their Enemy; to make the beſt of any defenſive Weapons they are provided with for themſelves; to ſhew them diſtinctly every thing that is likely to happen in the midſt of an Engagement; to bring them acquainted with Tryals of that kind; and train them as in form and heat of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: And laſtly, to propoſe Rewards and Honour for Them that excell, and are moſt dextrous; by that means to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Diligence, and warm their Ambition.</p>

                                    <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hard Labour, which is of great benefit for inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to Pain, and Toil, and Sweat, and Duſt: For<note n="†" place="bottom">Exercitus Labore proſicit, Otio conſeneſeit.</note>

And therefore they ſhould be taught to break Ground, and caſt up well; to plant regular Palliſadoes, to raiſe ſtout Barricadoes; to run, and ſetch, and carry heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; for all theſe things are highly neceſſary, both to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Lines, and defend themſelves; and likewiſe for the preſſing upon, and encloſing an Enemy.</p>
                                 <pb n="429" facs="tcp:53648:513"/>
                                 <p> The <hi>Third</hi> thing they are to be inſtructed in, and accuſtom'd to, is exact Order; which as it is of infinite uſe, ſo is it likewiſe of different ſorts, according to the different poſture of Affairs, and Exigencies of War. Firſt it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with regard to the ranging and diſtributing the Troops, cantoning them out either into Battalions, or Regiments, or Standards, or Companies. Secondly, In the Diſpoſition of the Camp; that due Diſtances and Proportions be obſerv'd in the ſeveral Quarters; that its Avenues, Outlets, and Lodgments be conveniently order'd for Horſe and Foot; ſo that it ſhall be eaſie for every one to ſind his own Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and proper Poſt. Thirdly, In Motions and Marches, whether only from Place to Place thro' the Country, or to front an Enemy; and here they are to be taught to keep their Ranks, to move equally, and at juſt Diſtances from each other, ſo as neither to go looſe and too far off, nor too cloſe and crowded together. All this Order is highly neceſſary, and is of great uſe in ſeveral reſpects. It adds much to the Beauty of an Army; is entertaining and marvellous delightful to all that ſee and obſerve it; it cheers our Friends, and animates them ſtrangely; confounds our Enemies, emboldens and inſpires the Soldiers themſelves with Security, and exceedingly ſacilitates all their Motions; and the obeying any Orders that ſhall be given by their Generals. For by this means the Word is no ſooner given, but, without any Noiſe or Confuſion in the World, it is convey'd from one to another, and the meaneſt moſt private Man preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtands the Mind of his ſupreme Officer.<note n="†" place="bottom">Imperium Ducis ſimul omnes Copiae ſentiunt: &amp; ad nutum regentis ſine tumultu reſpondent.</note>

This in ſhort is the Subſtance of Military Diſcipline, to which a General muſt give Force and Authority, by Largeſſes and Rewards bountifully ſcatter'd among thoſe that are tractable and valiant, and deſerving; and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and exemplary Puniſhments inflicted upon the Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and Idle, and Negligent.

                                    </gap>erate Author, who treats of this Subject, overlook them. Some few of theſe I ſhall briefly repreſent to my Reader here, and leave
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53648:516"/>it to him from his own Obſervation or Experience, to add more, as he ſhall ſee occaſion. Now of theſe there are two ſorts: Some of conſtant uſe throughout the whole Courſe of the War: Others accidental and occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal only, as Times, or Places, or other Circumſtances ſhall happen to make them ſeaſonable. I begin with the Former ſort.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt of theſe is Watching all Opportunities with the utmoſt Diligence and Circumſpection; ſecuring all that offer, that none ſlip by unprofitably; and at the ſame time preventing and countermining the Enemy, that he ſhall have no benefit by thoſe that are put into His Hands. For Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity hath a huge Run, a mighty Stroke in all Affairs of Human Life, and more eſpecially in War; where one lucky Hit does more ſometimes, than all the Hands and Heads of a Kingdom put together.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The Second is, Making his Advantage of Reports; for be they true or falſe, they are capable of doing great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and eſpecially while they are freſh and warm.<note n="*" place="bottom">Famâ bella conſtant, fama bellum conficit, in ſpem metumve impellit animos.</note> 
                                    <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame begins, continues, ends Wars; exalts Men's Minds with aſſured Hopes, dejects them with pannick Fears.</hi> They fight as the News goes; and many a Field hath been loſt and won, by virtue of a current Rumor; which, tho' ſo powerful in its Effects, had yet perhaps little or no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, ſtand upon it ſelf. This laſt Advice chiefly regards a Man as yet unſetled in his Meaſures: But when the Scheme is laid, and he is not only determin'd ſo much as in thoſe Circumſtances one can, but hath entred upon his Deſigns.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Then my Third Direction is, not to trouble himſelf about any ſuch Rumours. He will do well indeed to get well inform'd, and to conſider of them carefully; but ſtill to proceed in his own Methods. To do what he is able, and what in Duty and Decency he is obliged to; what Reaſon preſcribes, and there to feſt; and expect the Event, as a wiſe and a brave Man ſhould do.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> But above all, let him in the Fourth place, take heed of being too conſident and ſecure; for this will lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infinite Miſtakes and Inconveniences, perhaps never to be retriev'd. A Man thinks meanly of his Enemy, as if he were deſpicable, and not worth his Care; and this betrays
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53648:516"/>him to Negligence, and Thoughtleſsneſs, and Sloth. Now This is the moſt dangerous and deſtructive Condition that a State of War is capable of. For whoever deſpiſes his Enemy, does moſt cerrainly expoſe and betray himſelf; and give that ſo deſpiſed Enemy an Advantage, which is no other Conſideration did, would ſingly render him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely formidable.<note n="*" place="bottom">Frequentiſſimum initum Calamitatis, Securitas. Nemo ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius opprimitur, quam qui non timet. Nil tutò in hoſte deſpicitur. Quem ſpreveris, valentiorem negligentià facies.</note> 
                                    <hi>Security is uſually the Forerunner and Occaſion of great Diſtreſs. No Body is ſo quickly defeated, as the Man that is under no Apprehenſions of Danger. Nothing in an Enemy can be deſpiſed with ſafety; for even that Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs, which naturally ſprings from Contempt, gives him more power to do you Miſchief.</hi> Theſe Reflections are true in their moſt general Senſe; but in War nothing ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; becauſe There nothing is, or can be frivolous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to juſtifie or deſerve it; for it, often happens, that what we look upon to be very ſmall and inconſiderable in it ſelf, is yet fruitful in great variety of Conſequences, and even prodigous Effects.<note n="†" place="bottom">Seepe parvis momentis magni caſus; ut nil timendi, ſic ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil contemnendi.</note> 
                                    <hi>Small Motions are often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by monſtrous Events; and therefore as nothing of this kind ought to perplex us with anxious Fears of it, ſo neither ought any thing to lull us aſleep with the ſlight of it, as not worth our Notice and Care.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, He ought to be extremely curious, and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the Condition of his Enemy, and the poſture of his Affairs; particularly he ſhould be ſure to get certain Information of the following Points. The Temper and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, the Inclination and Deſigns of the Commander in chief; the Temper of the People and Army under him; what their Manners are, and in what way they live; the Situation of the Places, and Condition of the Country all round about his Camp; and where either the Scene of Action, or any Motions of his Army may probably be. And this was <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s peculiar Excellence.</p>
                                 <p>As for Engagement and Action it ſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> ſeveral things muſt be taken into Conſideration; the Time, the Place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53648:517"/>Action. One may venture to ſay in general, That it is by no means prudent to wait for the Enemy in your own Country; his Entrance thither ſhould, if poſſible, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and you ought either to advance and meet him, ſo as to make his Territories the Seat of War; or elſe to ſecure your own Paſſes, and ſtop him at his approach. But if he have already vanquiſhed that Difficulty, and got Footing; it is by no means adviſable to run the Riſque of a Battle, except you have another Army in reſerve to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and recruit you ſpeedily. For this would be to play a deſperate Game, and to ſtake All upon one ſingle Throw. But when Matters draw toward an Engagement, the Ground ought to be well viewed, and prudently choſen; and as you find it for your own, or your Enemies Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, you muſt manage your ſelf accordingly: For the Ground it ſelf is a very great, and ſometimes almoſt an inſuperable Advantage. Now a plain open Country is moſt convenient for the Horſe, becauſe this gives them Room to wheel and Scour in; but your narrow Defiles, and Places full of Boggs, Moraſſes, Ditches and Trees, are moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Foot, becauſe Theſe give no Opportunity to the Cavalry to break in and Flank them.</p>

                                    <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> A General muſt alſo be Careful with whom he engages, <note place="margin">Perſons.</note> and never venture a Battle with an Enemy ſtronger than himſelf. Now, this Strength is not always to be meaſured by Numbers; but by the Courage and Reſolution of the Men. And nothing makes Men ſo Valiant as Neceſſity; becauſe this is almoſt an invincible Enemy; and therefore the Streſs of it awakens all our Powers to make Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon this Account it is a good Rule, never to fight with Men reduced to deſperate Circumſtances, but rather to put an Opportunity into their Hands of being upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Terms with you. And this agrees exactly with the Counſel given in the former Paragraph, of not Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding an Engagement in one's own Countrey; becauſe the Enemy muſt then be forc'd to make a Deſperate and Bloody Buſineſs of it; as being ſenſible, that if he happen to be worſted, there is no avoiding of utter Ruine.

There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Two Caſes, wherein ſuch Rules are obligatory; That I mean of Perſonal Quatrels, and Diſputes between pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men; and that of National Controverſies too, where the Matter in queſtion concerns ſome former Engagements, or when there have been mutual Alliances and Compacts treated formerly between them. But where neither of theſe is the Caſe; that is to ſay, in a formal and direct War, and where no Faith hath been given, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently none can be broken, it is allowable to humble and defeat an Enemy any manner of Way: For the proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of War is like paſſing Sentence of Death; all againſt whom it is denounc'd, lie under Condemnation; and if that Sentence were juſt, it will be lawful to exterminate and bring them to Execution, by the ſnatching every Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Advantage of doing it. This agrees with the Notion of very brave and deſervedly renowned Generals,

But though Peace be never ſo deſirable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for our preſent Circumſtances, yet even a good thing may be bought too dear. We muſt not therefore be ſo immoderately Fond of it, as not to take Care, that it be Honourable, and upon fair and Reaſonable Terms; For if this be not rightly adjuſted, however that common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may prevail of a counterfeit and baſe Peace being better than a juſt and Creditable War; yet a Prince had better preſerve his Liberty at the Price of his Life, and hazard all gloriouſly, than ſubmit himſelf and his People to vile reproachful Terms, and live in Slavery and Infamy. A Peace then ſhould not be patch'd up for a preſent Turn, and to Skin over a Sore; but it ſhould be free and fair, without Trick, or Deſign, or deceitful Reſervations; ſuch as may entirely end the War, and not only ſuſpend Acts of Hoſtility for a while, and ſo protract, and kindle War afreſh.

But, when we are ſo diſpoſed to grant a Peace, we ſhould be liberal in our Conceſſions, and give large and liberal Conditions, that ſo it may be firm and laſting. For if it be rigorous and hard, we muſt expect, that thoſe who are oppreſt by us, will be ſure to revolt, and break looſe from their Covenants, as ſoon as ever they find it feaſible and convenient.

The Former is always in deep Anxiety and Suſpenſe, agitated and toffed between Hope and Fear; the Latter puts himſelf under Covert, lies down upon the Ground, and ſatisfies himſelf with the Comfort that he can fall no lower. The Former takes pains to eſcape the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; the Latter labours to endure and get through it; and it very often happens, That This Man hath the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bargain of it, and comes off with leſs Trouble and Loſs We know Men are often at more Expence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Title by Law, than the whole thing they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for is worth: And thus it is very often in other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The cheapeſt Courſe they can take is to fit down by the Loſs; and many an Affliction is born with more Eaſe to the Sufferer, than it can be either avoided or ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with. The Covetous Wretch is a greater torment to himſelf, than He that is really Poor; and the Jealous Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band feels more uneaſineſs, tho' his Jealouſie be groundleſs and undeſerv'd, than the Cuckold who hath been actually diſhonour'd, but either knows it not, or regards it not. The peculiar Virtue of the Former, and that which is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his Circumſtances is Prudence; for His is active Valour; That of the Latter is Temper, and Conſtancy, and Patience; for his part is purely paſſive. But indeed, why ſhould a Man be confin'd to either of theſe ſingly? Wherefore ſhould he not uſe and try both, in their Order and proper Seaſon? For methinks Prudence and Vigilance ſhould be the firſt Attempt; and when theſe are found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, then is the time for changing our Meaſures, and Patience ſhould ſucceed in their Place. Thus much at leaſt is certain and undoubted, that in all Publick Contingencies the Methods for Prevention and Remedy ought firſt to be try'd; Thoſe that are in Truſt and Office, and have it in their Power to ſerve and promote the Common Good, are indiſpenſably obliged to it, and ought to ſtand in the Gap againſt all managable Difficulties and Misfortunes. In the Caſe of private Perſons, I confeſs it is otherwiſe; there a Man hath none but himſelf to anſwer for; and it will be agreeable to Wiſdom and Duty both, to conſider the ſtate of the Matter before him, and conſult his own Abilities; and then to make a Choice of ſuch Methods and Management, as appear moſt advantageous in the preſent Circumſtances, and as he feels himſelf beſt qualify'd for.</p>

                              <p>THE proper and moſt effectual Courſe to lighten the Sufferings of Human Life, and to ſweeten the Paſſions under them, is by no means to ſet on's ſelf in Battel array, and enter into a formal Combat with them; for Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Caſe does but blow the Coals, and render them more ſurious and inſupportable. The Eagerneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and Contradiction does but irritate and inflame the Sore, inſtead of mollifying the ſharp Humour, or aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Pain. And therefore He who would conſult his Eaſe, and the Serenity of his own Mind, ſhould betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to one of the two following Remedies.</p>
                              <p>The Firſt is, That of diverting, and drawing them off to another Courſe. Thus we preſerve our Lands from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations, by opening Trenches, and carrying off the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by another Channel: And thus Phyſicians, when they find the Morbiſick Matter too obſtinate to be purg'd away, try to give it a Turn, and throw it into ſome other part, where the Conſequence may be leſs dangerous to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And This, when attempted, muſt be done by means as gentle, by degrees as eaſie and inſenſible, as can poſſibly be. For the Application, when prudently and dexterouſly made uſe of, is of marvellous Efficacy in all manner of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. Nor ought it to be thought odd or peculiar, ſince it is the common Remedy and Practice of Mankind, not in Affliction only, but in every other Caſe which is difficult or diſguſting: And what I adviſe here, every Man who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves nicely, will find to be the Expedient, which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally preſcribes to himſelf. This is the Art we uſe, to ſwallow down the bittereſt Morſels, and by which we feel our ſelves inſenſibly harden'd to endure the Approach of Death it ſelf. So ſays the Philoſopher,<note n="*" place="bottom">Abducendus Animus eſt ad ſtudia alia, curas, negotia; Loci denique mutatione, tanquam aegroti non convaleſcentes, curandus eſt.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Mind muſt be drawn off to new Objects, freſh Diverſions of Pleaſure, of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nay even of Cares and anxious Thoughts of another kind; or, if nothing elſe will do, we muſt treat it as they do ſick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and try if change of Air, and another Country, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53648:524"/>any thing to the Cure.</hi> Thus, when timorous People are to paſs by ſome dreadful Precipice, we prevent or leſſen the Fright, by prevailing with them to ſhut then Eyes, or look another way. And thus Men commonly wink, when the Executioner is to give the Stroke: Thus we endeavour to amuſe Women and Children upon letting Blood, and tho' neither the Danger or the Pain be what can juſtifie their Fears, yet the very Sight and Approach of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet is ſomething they cannot ſupport. And, ſince all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are in ſome meaſure tinctur'd with this Infirmity; ſince ſome Sufferings ſeem to be an over-match for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; we have all the reaſon in the World to think the Stratagem of <hi>Hippomenes</hi> a very proper Pattern for our Imitation. The Story we find repreſented by the Poets; and it is briefly thus. <hi>Hippomenes</hi> was to run a Race with <hi>Atalanta,</hi> a Lady of exquiſite Beauty, and celebrated Agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Conditions were. That if he loſt the Race, he ſhould loſe his Life; but if he won it, the Lady was to be his Prize. He diſtruſting his own Swiftneſs of Foot upon even Terms, provided Three Golden Apples, and as they were running, took occaſion to let theſe fall at convenient diſtances one after another; and thus by taking up her time, who ſtooped to gather them up, he diverted her from the Buſineſs of the Race, and won both the Day and the Bride into the Bargain. The Application I would make of that Fable is only This; That if the Conſideration of one Misfortune, or grievous Accident, which we at preſent labour under; or if the Remembrance of any paſt Calamity lie heavy upon our Minds; or if ſome boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and violent Paſſion ruffle and torment us, which we our feel ſelves unable to ſubdue by downright ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; the beſt Expedient will be, to ſhift the Scene, and bring ſome other Thought upon the Stage. For when we cannot abſolutely exterminate, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſe it, there is the gaining of a Point in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at leaſt, when we can change a more dangerous Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity for one that is leſs ſo, and baniſh one Paſſion with another leſs outragious. All this, in the mean while, is not intended to diſcourage Men's entring into the Liſts, and making a formal gallant Oppoſition againſt the Evils they ſuffer, and the Reſentments provoked by them. But the proper Seaſon for this Advice, is when the Enemy is too mighty, and the Combat unequal and unſucceſsful: For when Fighting will do no good, a wiſe Man will try to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53648:525"/>ſave himſelf by Flight; he muſt dodge, and wheel, and get out of the way of Miſchief. Or, if it dog him ſo cloſe, that there is no avoiding it, he muſt try to ſoften and break the Force of it, by ſome freſh Diverſions, and taking Sanctuary in ſome Thoughts of another kind, which may give a Turn to the Soul, and change the Current of the Imagination: Or, if they cannot go ſo far as to make a perfect Exchange, yet ſuch at leaſt may give the Miſery ſome Interruption, and divide thoſe ungrateful <hi>Idea's,</hi> which they are too feeble either to keep down, or to root out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, tho' at the Expence of new one's planted in their room.</p>
                              <p>The Second Expedient, and that which is moſt adviſable in Caſes of great Extremity, where the danger is ſo evident, and inevitable, that a Man hath nothing left him to do, but to ſtand the Shock, is to ſtoop a little under the Blow, and give place to Neceſſity: For by ſhewing a Man's ſelf obſtinate in ſuch a Caſe, and reſolving not to yield in any Point, the Violence is but the greater, and the Treatment we meet with ſo much the rougher; it being the Nature of Oppoſition to provoke; and our Paſſions in ſuch Caſes, like Torrents, which no Dams are ſtrong enough to ſtemm, rage the more for being pent up, and at laſt ſwell the higher, and bear down all before them. In ſuch Caſes therefore, a Man muſt be content to ſee himſelf over-rul'd; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rules he hath fix'd to his Behaviour in ordinary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they muſt be dealt with as wiſe Politicians do by the Laws of the Land; who, when they fall ſhort, and cannot do what they would have them, alter their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and make them do what they can. It hath been by Many eſteem'd a Reproach upon <hi>Cato,</hi> and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blemith in his Character, that he was ſo very ſtiff and nice in the Civil Wars which happen'd in his Time, and rather ſuffer'd the Commonwealth to be driven to the laſt Extremities, than he would contribute to its Relief at the Expence of ſome I aws, which the preſent Neceſſity and Diſtreſs made it very reaſonable to have diſpenſed with. On the other hand, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had ſo great a regard to the Publick Good, that he continu'd in his Office beyond the Term prefixed, tho' the Law prohibited the doing ſo upon pain of Death; ſo juſt a Senſe had he of the End and Nature of Laws, that they are deſign'd for the Service and Advantage of the State, and cannot in any equitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be ſuppoſed to bind, where the Exigence of Affairs
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:53648:525"/>is ſuch, that by obſerving the Letter of the Law, a Man deſtroys the End of it. Accordingly we find this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Philopaemon,</hi> that he was a Perſon born to Command: For he was not only Maſter of the Art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning according to Law, but had the Skill of Governing the Law it ſelf, when any Publick Neceſſity requir'd that it ſhould be ſet aſide; and left no other Refuge, but the Diſcretion of the Magiſtrate. For it often happens, That Thoſe at Helm are put out of their common Road by ſome difficult and extraordinary Emergencies; and in ſuch Caſes it is their Duty as well as Wiſdom to ply to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſteer what Courſe they can. And indeed, in all Extremities, Private as well as Publick, a Prudent Man will be content to bend a little, to yield and comply as far as he may, and by all honeſt Stratagems to ſave the main Chance. For in theſe Matters there is a Latitude and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Relaxation allowed; ſome Moderation and Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thoſe who are unacquainted with the preſent Circumſtances, can be no competent Judges of. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be very tender, how we condemn a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, which is ſo far from being contrary to Reaſon, and Juſtice, that it is highly agreeable to both; and not only ſo, but a Maſter-piece of Prudence in thoſe who manage it skilfully.</p>

                              <p>BY this Intricacy and Uncertainty of Affairs, I underſtand ſuch a Juncture as hath great Appearance of Reaſon, and ſtrong Arguments on both ſides; ſo that the Man is at a loſs, and does not diſcern, nor know how to chooſe what is beſt and moſt convenient for him; This creates diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and perplexity of Thought; and till ſome other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration fall in to turn the Scale, the beſt thing we can do is to conſider, where there are the greateſt Odds of Juſtice, and Honour, and Decency; and by all means fall in with that ſide. For, altho' the Event ſhould prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Expectation or Deſire, yet ſtill there will be a ſecret Satisfaction, the Complacency and Teſtimony of our own Breaſts, to ſupport us within; and the Reputation and Praiſe of Men without, for having choſen the better, tho' not the more fortunate Courſe. Nor ought any Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:53648:526"/>in ſuch a Caſe, to provoke the leaſt Remorſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man can tell what Providence hath to do, or how that will diſpoſe of Him and his Endeavours; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he cannot be ſecure that his Diſappointment or his Calamity would have been leſs, tho' he had taken quite different Meaſures. And therefore, when a Man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve himſelf which is the eaſieſt and the ſhorteſt way to his Journey's End, the beſt Determination he can come to, is to keep the ſtreighteſt Road.</p>

                              <p>IT is often Men's Fate in Matters of Difficulty, to ſucceed as They that are over-nice and cautious commonly do in Bargaining, and Articles of Agreement; where an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Care to make all faſt, and prevent all manner of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is but a means of increaſing the Danger, and ruining All. For by this mighty Circumſpection, ſo much more Time is ſpent, ſo many mere People are employ'd, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Clauſes and Proviſo's inſerted; that the Differences and Squabbles ariſing upon it, are multiply'd in proportion to the Clutter made for avoiding them. To all which we may add, that this is the way to provoke Fortune, who is jealous of her Honour, and will not bear the Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Man's pretending to exempt himſelf from Her Juriſdiction. Which after all is a vain Attempt, and what the moſt provident Man alive can never compaſs: For there is One Above, who hath a Power Paramount,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vim ſuam ingruentem refringi non vnlt.</note> and will not ſuffer his Dominion to be encroach'd upon. And therefore the beſt way ſeems to be the diſpatching them with all the Expedition and Eaſineſs we can, and rather to run the Riſque of ſome little Danger, than create a great deal of Diſſatisfaction and Torment to our ſelves, by our extraordinary Nicety and Caution.</p>
                              <p>In Caſes of manifeſt Danger, it is neceſſary a Man ſhould have both Wiſdom and Courage; He ſhould look before him, and ſee Dangers at a diſtance, and make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eſtimate of them; For Men are very apt to ſee theſe things in ſalſe Proportions, and to look upon them thro' the Glaſs of Paſſion, rather than calm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53648:526"/>Reaſon. This is one account, why ſuch things are generally apprehended otherwiſe than in reality they are, becauſe the Affection predominant at that time, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them greater or leſs, and impoſes upon the Judgment by ſuch <hi>Idea's.</hi> But then, tho' it may become a wiſe Man to foreſee all Hazards that are in any degree probable; yet it is no way unworthy of him to conſider them as Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, that they may not, as well as that they may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; that it is great odds all of them will not happen; That of thoſe which do, All will not have the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Effects, which it is ſit for one to ſorm in his own Mind, who makes it his buſineſs to provide againſt the very worſt that can come; that a Man ſhall, by the help of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Prudence, be able to deal with the greateſt part of them well enough. In this Caſe too, it is ſit to conſider in which of thoſe Accidents that threaten us, we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves Aſſiſtance, and accordingly to provide our Succours: And as generally in All, ſo in theſe Junctures more eſpecially, to take Courage, to ſix our Reſolutions, and be ſteady in our Undertakings. For, when once a Man hath conſider'd what he goes about, and ſinds it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Duty, and what every way becomes him to do, he is obliged by all means to perſevere, and not ſuffer any Proſpect of Danger to diſcourage him in a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Attempt. A Wiſe Man indeed will never want Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, becauſe he proceeds with Deliberation and Thought; prevents the Miſchief of Surprize, and provides againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing likely to croſs his Deſign. But then it is no leſs expedient, That the Man of Courage have a Mixture of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too; for without This all his Boldneſs is but rath Hear, and a blind fool-hardy Giddineſs.</p>

                              <p>WE are now advancing to ſuch Accidents, as of all others are of the greateſt, moſt general, and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence, and therefore it will be fit to enlarge a little the more upon them. Which ſhall be done, firſt by giving a particular Deſcription of the Thing it ſelf; Then by laying down ſuch Directions as may be ſerviceable to a Prince under them. And then in the Concluſion of this Subject, caſting together into one Chapter that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53648:527"/>proper for private Perſons to follow upon theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                              <p>By Conſpiracies I mean the Attempts made, either by ſome one Man ſingly, or by ſeveral in Combination, againſt the Perſon of the Prince, or the State and Government in general. And this muſt be acknowledged a Circumſtance of infinite Danger, extremely hard either to eſcape or to remedy, by reaſon of the Secreſie, and induſtrious Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Thing. For which way ſhall a Man be able to ſecure himſelf from the treacherous Aſſaults of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, unſuſpected Enemy? And what ſhall give any juſt Jealouſie of that Man's being ſo, who wears the Face, and acts the part of our faithfulleſt, tendereſt, and moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Friend? The Thoughts and Inclinations of the Heart lie too dark and deep for Human Eyes to penetrate; and yet here is all the Danger; for they who deſign a Prince's Ruine, will take all the care they can, that no Overt Act, no failure of Reſpect, no Coldneſs or Negligence in Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, may miniſter cauſe of Suſpicion; but will rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Expreſſions of Duty and Reſpect, and mask their Villany by an officious and double Diligence. Beſides, do but conſider the Advantages of a deſperate and bloody-minded Man; for he that does not value his own Life, may make himſelf Maſter of any other Man's whenever he pleaſes.

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Machiavel</hi> takes great Pains to ſhew how Plots againſt the State ought to be contriv'd, and ſo laid as to prove Succeſsful. We leave that wicked Policy to Him; and ſhall employ all our Care to ſhew how they may beſt be diſcover'd and defeated.</p>
                              <p>Now the beſt Remedies and Directions that I can think of for ſo critical and hazardous a Juncture, are theſe that follow.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> Private Intelligence, and cunning underhand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, to diſcover and counterwork all Attempts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53648:527"/>in which Faithful, Vigilant, and Diſcreet Perſons ſhould be made uſe of as Inſtruments. Theſe are the Eyes and Ears of the Prince; and therefore they ſhould be every where, to diſcover and bring Information of all that may concern him to know; but particularly they ſhould have a ſpecial regard to all that his Principal Officers and Miniſters ſay and do: becauſe Theſe are capable of doing moſt Miſchief, and he cannot be tolerably ſafe, if they be falſe to him. Now it is as obſervable in this Caſe, as in any whatſoever, That <hi>Out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> For People, who have a Deſign upon the Government, naturally love to aſperſe and blacken the Prince, cenſure his Adminiſtration ſeverely, and load him with Calumnies; or if they have Temper enough to be ſilent themſelves, yet they love the Converſation of thoſe that do ſo, hearken with a ſenſible Reliſh and Delight to all kind of Factious Diſcourſe; and frequent the Company of Men, who by railing and blaming all that is done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Jealouſies, and foment Diſcontents among the People. It is very neceſſary therefore, that a Prince ſhould be well informed what his Subjects, but eſpecially what thoſe about his Perſon, ſay of him; what Company they keep, and how they entertain themſelves; and it is fit that he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to reward the Perſons, who make ſuch uſeful Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, not only with Impunity, but large Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for their good Service. But then he muſt be no leſs careful too of another Inconvenience which may ariſe from too eaſie a Credulity. For tho' he will do wiſely to hear all, yet he is by no means bound to believe all. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I mentioned, as they are Recompences well beſtow'd upon faithful and good Men, ſo are they likewiſe great Temptations to ill Men; and therefore every Report of this kind ſhould be very diligently examin'd, before a Prince gives credit to it; or otherwiſe this Expedient for his own Preſervation will be converted into a means of cruſhing and murdering the Innocent; and of making himſelf the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Deteſtation and Reproach, the Terrour and the Curſe of his People.</p>
                              <p>The Second Preſervative in this Caſe, is Winning and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Hearts and Affections of all his Subjects, nay even of his very Enemies, by Methods of Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Courteſie and Clemency. For when all is done,<note n="*" place="bottom">Fidiſſima Cuſtodia Principis Innocentia.</note> 
                                 <hi>A Prince's beſt and ſtrongeſt Guard is his Innocency;</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53648:528"/>an Univerſal Bleſſing, good to all, injurious and grievous to none. The Apoſtle had reaſon when he asked that Queſtion, <hi>Who is He that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> For, uſually ſpeaking, The Man that gives no Offence, takes an effectual Courſe that none ſhall be given him: But he who does Injuries, muſt expect to have them paid back again with Intereſt: And therefore the worſt uſe that can poſſibly be made of Power, is to exert it to unjuſt and baſe Purpoſes, and make it an Inſtrument of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Violence. So ſays a wiſe Author,<note n="*" place="bottom">Male vim ſuam Poteſtas, aliorum contumeliis experitur.</note> Power ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver puts out its own Strength ſo ill, as when it breaks forth into Inſolence, and contumelious uſage of thoſe Perſons whoſe Weakneſs hath laid them at its Mercy.</p>
                              <p>A Third Expedient upon theſe Occaſions is, To ſet the beſt Face upon the Matter; not to betray any Dejection of Mind, but carry all off with one's uſual Gayety and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Behaviour; To give out abroad, that he is very ſenſible what People are doing, and punctually inform'd of all their Secret Practices and Deſigns; that there paſſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at any of their Cabals, but he hath immediately an Account of it: For where Privacy is the Life of an Attempt, if once the Plotters can be brought to believe that all they do, takes Air, the Project is broken of courſe. This was an Expedient which a certain Perſon aſſiſted <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Tyrant with, and it was bought cheap at the Price of a Talent.</p>
                              <p>The Fourth Direction is, To wait for any danger of this kind without any Confuſion or Conſternation of Mind: Theſe Three laſt Rules <hi>Caeſar</hi> practiſed in great Perfection; but in the firſt he was altogether deficient; Indeed he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to diſdain it, as a thing below him, and not worth his while; and declared, That he thought a Prince had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter die once for all, than live in a perpetual Anxiety and Pain, for any Accident which the moſt vigilant thoughtful Man alive hath it not in his Power to prevent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would rather chooſe to be eaſie, and in This, as well as other Matters, truſt the Event entirely to Divine Providence, which alone can protect and ſecure the Perſons of Princes effectually. But ſtill this Reflection does not take off the uſefulneſs and neceſſity even of my firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the reſt it leaves in their full force. Which in truth are yet more recommended by the ill Succeſs of Courſes
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53648:528"/>contrary to theſe: For all Hiſtories, and particularly thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, ſhew beyond contradiction, that the Intentions to prevent ſuch Plottings by ſpeedy Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and rigorous Puniſhments, did very ſeldom obtain their deſired Effect: They rather exaſperated Men's Minds, than ſubdu'd them; and the ſevereſt and moſt haſty to take Revenge, and terrifie their People, were commonly leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and found the worſt Treatment from them.</p>
                              <p>Thus much may ſerve for Advice how Princes ought to behave themſelves, while the Deſigns againſt their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Government are kept cloſe and in the dark. But when ſuch Conſpiracies come to be diſcover'd, and the Truth brought to light, What is fit to be done then? Why truly my firſt and moſt general Direction muſt be, To make the Conſpirators publick Examples, by puniſhing them with all the Severity their Villanies deſerve. To ſpare ſuch black Wretches as theſe, were not Compaſſion but Cruelty; Cruelty to the Innocent, and Peaceable, and Good; and Treachery to the Publick, whoſe Safety is expoſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by ſuch indiſcreet Inſtances of Pity: For Juſtice and Equity require, that Thoſe who are Enemies to the Peace and Quiet, the Liberties and Rights, and common Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind, ſhould make Reparation with their Blood, for their Attempts to over-turn and deſtroy theſe ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſo valuable Advantages. But then, even thoſe Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be managed with Prudence and Diſcretion; and the manner and Method of Puniſhing muſt vary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Face and Condition of Affairs ſhall happen to vary. Sometimes it is convenient to uſe all poſſible Diſpatch, and puniſh preſently, eſpecially where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators are not very numerous. But be the Number of them great or ſmall, I can by no means approve of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Criminals to the Torture, in order to larger Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the bringing out Accomplices not yet known. (For there are other ways of getting Information by ſofter and more ſecret dealing, which very ſeldom fail; and beſides, it may often be of uſe not to ſeem very ſollicitous to know, or if one does know, to appear otherwiſe, and pretend Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in ſuch Caſes.) But, beſides all other Miſchiefs of ſuch a barbarous Cuſtom as the Rack, this is one certain Diſcouragement, that a Man is ſure to torment others for the Diſcovery of that, which when found out, will be a Plague and Torment to himſelf, and ſet a world of People againſt him too. Nor do I think it always neceſſary that
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53648:529"/>every Individual Malefactor ſhould ſuffer: It is enough that ſome few are made exemplary Warnings to the reſt; ſo many as may encourage and contain good Subjects in their Duty, and reclaim the Factious, by ſtriking an early Awe into thoſe, who are not yet, or at leaſt do not imagine that they are diſcovered. Sometimes again it is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer puniſhing the Offenders; but to be ſure upon all ſuch Emergencies, the Prince's own Safety muſt be his firſt and great Care: In this no Time muſt be loſt; the reſt may well ſubmit, and be regulated afterwards, as Opportunities beſt offer. But the Caſe may have greater Difficulties in it ſtill, The Conſpirators may be Perſons of ſuch Quality and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or the Diſcovery may be made in ſuch a critical Juncture, that a Prince may be obliged to diſſemble his Knowledge and his Danger; and the offering to ſeize or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Guilty, may hazard his Life and Kingdom ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: In ſuch a Streight it requires a great deal of good Conduct to play a ſafe Game. The beſt Courſe of all is without queſtion to countermine and prevent their Plot; to break all their Meaſures privately; and when the Danger is thus avoided, to decline the giving Offence, by pretending not to know the Parties concern'd, but to manage the Matter, and ſecure himſelf, while all the while he appears intent upon ſomething elſe. Thus the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> managed their General <hi>Hanno,</hi> and the Hiſtorian's Remark upon this Method of proceeding is,<note n="*" place="bottom">Optimum &amp; ſolum ſaepe inſidiarum remedium, ſi non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligantur.</note> 
                                 <hi>That often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the beſt, nay the only way to prevent treacherous Practices, is to act as if one knew nothing at all of the Matter.</hi> Nay, which is ſtill more; I am poſitive that ſometimes it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary not to puniſh Conſpirators at all. For if the principal Contriver be a very great Man; if his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or his Deſerts have made him popular; if his former Services have been very conſiderable, and the Prince and Government particularly obliged by him: If his Children, his Relations, his Friends are in great Poſts, or Men of Wealth, and general Intereſt: What would you do in ſuch a Caſe? How would you break through all theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Who indeed would attempt it? Who would provoke ſuch Dangers, and make ſo many and ſuch dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not rather by wholly remitting his Puniſhment, if that can ſafely be done; or if not, yet at leaſt by miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53648:529"/>and rendring it as gentle as the Caſe will bear; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a good Underſtanding, and ſecure the Affections of all who have an Intereſt in his Pardon? Clemency upon ſuch an Occaſion is not only Brave and great, (for indeed nothing can be more for the Honour of a Prince,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nil glorioſius Principe impunè laeſo.</note> nothing give us a brighter Image of Virtue and Magnanimity, than a Monarch pardoning the Affronts and Ill-Uſage which he never deſerv'd) But it is alſo very often the moſt prudent and politick Courſe, and moſt effectual Security to him for the Future. For Men, who have any the leaſt remains of Ingenuity and Humanity, will be melted by it into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and better Principles. Perfidiouſneſs it ſelf will be put out of Countenance; and others who ſee ſuch eminent Goodneſs, will be aſhamed of any baſe Deſign, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diverted from purſuing or projecting it. And of this <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hath given us a famous Inſtance, both as to the Prudential, and the Succeſsful Part, in his Behaviour to <hi>Cinna,</hi> when engaged in a Conſpiracy againſt him.</p>

                              <p>BY Treachery and Treaſonable Practices, I underſtand a ſecret Attempt or Conſpiracy, not againſt the Prince's own Perſon, or the Government in general, as the former Head was; but againſt ſome particular Poſt, or Place of Strength, or ſome diſtinct and leſs Body of Men. In this reſpect it differs from what went before; but they both agree in their Nature and Character of being ſecret and unforeſeen Evils, extremely dangerous if they ſucceed, and as hard to be avoided or prevented. For the Traytor is commonly hid in a Crowd, in the very midſt of the Party he deſigns to betray, or of the Fortification which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make ſale of, and deliver up into the Enemies hand. The Perſons moſt diſpoſed to this abominable perfidious Trade, are the Covetous, the ſickle and fond of Change, and the formal Diſſemblers. And this Quality too they have, that they make a mighty Noiſe and Buſtle with their Loyalty, are large in their Commendations of it; violently and unſeaſonably clamorous againſt all breach of Truſt; ſuperſtitiouſly nice in Matters of little or no Conſequence;
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53648:530"/>and theſe Pretences and Extraordinary Affectations of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by which they labour to conceal their Villany, are really the beſt and ſureſt Marks to diſcover and diſtinguiſh them by: For they are ſo natural to Men of ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that any Man who knows what it is to over-act a Part, cannot but find them out. Now the Directions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for ſuch Occaſions, are for the moſt part the ſame with thoſe in the former Caſe. Only in the Matter of <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> indeed, this difference is to be made, That Theſe Men ought to be made Examples immediately, to be dealt with after a very rigorous manner, and excluded from all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: For they are Men of wretched; profligate, incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tempers, the Bane and Peſt of Mankind; no Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is to be expected from them; and therefore ſince Pity is loſt, as to all hopes of doing Good upon the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves, it is neceſſary they ſhould be cut off for the Sake and Safety of others.</p>

For, to ſhew himſelf with a Face full of Fear and Diſtruſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Flatrery and mean Remonſtrances, is beneath a Prince's Character: It makes him cheap and contemptible, encourages the Inſolence of the People, and does but inflame inſtead of appeaſing their Rage.

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53648:531"/>the Mobb, and quieting them when they run into Tumults and riotous Inſurrections. The beſt and braveſt is that of the Prince himſelf quieting them; but This (as I obſerv'd) is a nice Undertaking, and had much better be waved, if he have not an abſolute Maſtery over his Paſſions, and be not in all Points qualify'd for the managing it dexterouſly. The other, which is more uſual, and more ſeaſible, is to do it by another hand; and here a greater Latitude may be allow'd, than the Majeſty of a Monarch can admit of. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and Cajolling, and all the Arts of Mollifying, are the proper Applications; for Stiffneſs and open Force will do nothing; and the more you oppoſe the Torrent, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and louder it grows. The many-headed Beaſt is in this regard like all other Wild ones, which are never to be tam'd with Blows and Beating, but may be brought to hand by ſoothing and gentle Uſage. And therefore an Agent ſhould never ſpare for good Words, and fair Promiſes, ſince theſe are the moſt ſucceſsful Artifices upon thoſe Occaſions. Nay ſome Philoſophers and wiſe Men have allow'd ſuch Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be liberal, even at the expence of Truth; and think that the Folly and Madneſs of an incenſed Multitude, may as innocently be amuſed with Fables and Fictions, as the Simplicity of Children, and the Phrenſies of Feveriſh Men are with idle Stories and Promiſes, that are never intended to be made good. <hi>Pericles</hi> had a wonderful Knack at this I eading the People at Pleaſure; he held them faſt by the Eyes, the Ears, the Belly; entertain'd them with Shews, and Plays, and Feaſts; and then made them do whatever he had a mind to. This, I confeſs, is much the meaner Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Two; There is ſomething in it ſervile and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble; but thoſe Punctilio's muſt be laid aſide, where Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity gives a Diſpenſation. But then they are only ſit for ſome Deputy, or Agent, and can never be Condeſcenſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Prince in his own Perſon. And thus we ſee <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenius Agrippa</hi> manag'd the Matter, when delegated from the Senate to the Commoners of <hi>Rome.</hi> But, if ſuch a one pretends to act with a high Hand, and expects to reduce People when they fly out, and break through all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of Reaſon and Duty, without making any Conceſſions, or offering any Terms of Accommodation, as <hi>Appius,</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> did; this is a very idle Attempt, and muſt ſucceed accordingly.</p>

                                 <hi>SECT. VIII.</hi> Faction and Combinations.</head>
                              <p>BY Factions and Combinations, I mean the Diviſions and Bandings together of Subjects againſt one another; and Theſe may differ both in Quality and Number; as the Perſons concerned are Great and Wealthy, or of a meaner Fortune and Condition, or as the Clans and Parties are each of them more or leſs numerous. This ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from private Piques and Grudges, which have grown and been cheriſh'd between ſingle Perſons, or are perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made hereditary to whole Families; but the uſual and more frequent Original of it is Ambition and Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Bane of Society and Government, which ſets the World on Fire, by kindling in every one a deſire of aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the higheſt and moſt honourable Poſt. The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which happen between Perſons of Eminence, and the firſt Quality, are by much the more dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Common-wealth. Some indeed there have been, who ſet up for Politicians, and pretend, that theſe diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties are of great Service and Convenience to the Publick; and that a Prince by this means is ſafer, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupported, as <hi>Cato</hi> was of Opinion, that the Authority of Maſters in private Families was ſecured by the Diſcords and Quarrels of their Servants. But This ſeems a Notion too reſin'd and far-fetch'd; and we may venture to ſay, there are but a few Caſes in which the Obſervation holds good. It may be true with regard to Tyrants and lawleſs Governours, to whom nothing is ſo formidable as the good Agreement of their Subjects; becauſe ſuch a general Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may tend to unite them againſt their common Oppreſſor: It may hold too in ſlight and inconſiderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſuch as the Quarrels and Competitions betwixt one City and another; or betwixt Ladies at Court, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſet up for Intelligence, and under-hand Intereſts: But in any Combinations of Conſequence, and in Governments well conſtituted, and duly adminiſtred, it is manifeſtly falſe. It is of infinite Concern, and abſolute Neceſſity, that, in ſuch Circumſtances, all making of Parties ſhould be check'd, and Faction cruſht in the very Egg. All their Diſtinctions, the Names they go by, the Dreſs or Badges by which
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53648:532"/>they know one another, and all the Foppery of that kind, utterly diſcountenanc'd and put down. For even Trifles of this Nature have ſometimes laid the Seeds, and been the firſt Beginnings of prodigious and unconceivable Miſchiefs. Witneſs the miſerable Combuſtion, and horrid Murders, which <hi>Zonaras</hi> tells us, happen'd in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who diſtinguiſh'd themſelves by wearing Blue and Green, in the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> And accordingly all Clubs or private Cabals that tend to the promoting ſuch Diviſions, ſhould be carefully diſperſed, and ſtrictly forbidden.</p>
                              <p>The Counſel I have to give upon ſuch Accidents, is briefly This. If the Faction happen between two Peers, or Perſons otherwiſe of Conſideration and Character in the State, the Prince will do well to bring them to a better Underſtanding by fair Means, and good Words; or if That do not ſucceed, by laying his poſitive Commands, and threatning the Party who refuſes to be reconciled, with his Diſpleaſure, and other ſevere Penalties upon his Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And this Courſe we find taken by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> to compoſe the Difference between <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> and <hi>Craterus;</hi> and by <hi>Archidamus</hi> with Two of his Friends. If they ſtill ſtand out, it may be proper to nominate ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator between them; and This a Perſon liable to no juſt ſuſpicion of Partiality; no way intereſted or prejudiced, for or againſt either of the Parties. And this will alſo be a very good Expedient to end the Diſputes, and ſettle the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions controverted on both ſides between greater Numbers of Subjects, or between Cities, or Societies of Men. If it be requiſite, that the Prince himſelf interpoſe, let this by all means be done with the Aſſiſtance of Counſel, that ſo the Odium of the Thing may be taken off from himſelf, and thoſe who ſuffer in the determination, may have no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Reſentment. For the Counſel of Princes ſerves to this and many other Purpoſes, as well as for Direction; and it is Prudence to call them together, and act with and by them, in a very ſolemn manner, in ſundry Inſtances, where there ariſes nothing of Difficulty, that can deſerve the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a Debate. If the Faction be among Perſons of meaner Circumſtances, but ſo, that great Numbers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in it; or if it grow too ſtrong to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by gentler Methods, and the Courſe of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the Prince muſt then have recourſe to his laſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and extinguiſh it by Force. But in this way of quelling
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:53648:532"/>it eſpecially, he muſt take good heed not to diſcover any particular Inclination to one ſide above the other. For This is very Ominous, and many Kings have loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their unreaſonable Partialities. They are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fathers of their whole Country; and it is unworthy the Dignity of that Relation, as well as beneath the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of their Character, to make Diſtinctions, and be of a Party themſelves. They muſt be Friends to All their Subjects; not ſide with Some, and by making their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap> ſuffer themſelves to become Enemies, and in effect denounce War againſt Others. We eaſily ſee the the Indecorum of ſuch Proceedings, when the Maſter of a Family debaſes himſelf to take part with one Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; for what is this indeed but to become a Fellow-Servant too, and to forget that both the Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties are under his Juriſdiction? But ſure the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is more monſtrous in Princes, when they forget that all the Subjects are their own; and therefore the Superiour hath nothing to do but to deal Juſtice with an even hand between Them, who are equal to one another, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo to Him. Once more: In all the foremention'd Caſes, 'tis beſt, if the Diſcontents can be quieted, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies decided, without making any publick Examples; becauſe Suffering exaſperates, and many angry Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances will remain, and riſe up hereafter. But if there be a neceſſity of Puniſhing, this ſhould be confin'd to as few as may be; and It ſufficiently vindicates the Honour of the Prince, and anſwers the End of the Penalty very well; if ſome of the Ringleaders, who were firſt and moſt active in creating the Diſturbance, be made to ſmart ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all the reſt be diſmiſs'd with the Impreſſions which ſuch a Mixture of Severity and Goodneſs will naturally leave upon them.</p>

                              </head>
                              <p>SEdition is a violent Commotion of the People againſt the Prince, or ſome of the Magiſtrates in ſubordination to him. The Cauſes of it are commonly Oppreſſion and Fear. For Thoſe, who have been guilty of ſome high. Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are afraid of being brought to the Puniſhment they deſerve; Others are jealous of their Privileges and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and imagine, that the Government deſigns to invade and run them down. And both theſe ſorts of Men are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the Apprehenſions of approaching Ruine, that they think the only way to ſave themſelves, is by ſtriking the firſt Blow. It alſo proceeds very often from too great Indulgence, Extravagance and Debauchery, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and extreme Scarcity of Money, or want of other indiſpenſable Supports of Human Life. So that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſeem of all others to be cut out for this Trade, are your Spend-thrifts and Bankrupts, Indigent and Uneaſie, Fickle and Lovers of Novelty; and all thoſe Lewd and Profligate Wretches, who lie under the Laſh of the Law, or at leaſt are obnoxious to, and afraid of Juſtice. Theſe ſeveral ſorts of Men cannot continue quiet long: Peace is by no means for their purpoſe, but every whit as great a Calamity to Them, as War is to the reſt of Mankind: They never ſleep ſweetly but in the midſt of a Riot; and the Liberty they doat upon is Licentiouſneſs and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The better to bring their Matters to bear, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive private Conferences, and ſend abroad their wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to poyſon the World; make loud and grievous Complaints, ſcatter ſecret and vile Inſinuations, at firſt in doubtful and ſuſpicious Words, but afterwards in virulent and open Defamations of the Government; ſet up for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, and pretend a mighty Zeal for Liberty and Property; profeſs the Publick Good to be their only Hope and End, and promiſe to redreſs the People's Grievances; Theſe are conſtantly ſome of the Masks, put on to cover their Villany, and thus they draw Numbers after them, who for want of diſcerning better, and ſeeing through their Hypocriſie, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bitter Pill thus guilded over.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now the Remedies and Directions proper for ſuch an Exigence of Affairs as this, are firſt of all ſuch as have been
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:53648:533"/>already inſiſted upon, in the Section of <hi>Popular Inſurrections and Tumults;</hi> that is, To draw them to a Parley, to have Matters truly repreſented, and ſo make them ſenſible of their Errour, and the Unreaſonableneſs of their Complaints and Diſcontents; and all this to be done by the Mediation of Perſons, whoſe unqueſtionable Credit and Character may render ſuch a Negotiation ſucceſsful. But if This do not ſucceed, the ſecond thing muſt be for a Prince to take Arms, and ſtrengthen himſelf againſt their Violence; yet ſo as not to be raſh and haſty upon them, but to proceed ſlowly and with much Deliberation; that they may have Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Time to recollect and qualifie the Fierceneſs and Heat of their Paſſions; and ſo the ill Men among them, by thinking better, may return to their Duty; and thoſe who are harmleſs, and good, may deſert their Seducers, and unite with the right ſide. For Time is a moſt excellent Phyſician, and ſeldom fails to allay and cure the common People, who are much more diſpoſed to quarrel, and be mutinous, than they are to come to Blows in good earneſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ferocior Plebs ad rebellandum quàm bellandum: tentare magis quàm tueri Libertatem.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Mobb</hi> (ſays a wiſe Hiſtorian) <hi>are furious and eager to rebel, but tame and poor-ſpirited in a regular Fight; and much better at making a puſh to ſtretch their Liberty, than at the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defence of it.</hi> A Third Expedient is, to be tampering with them all this while, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and try to divide and diſſettle their Minds<note n="†" place="bottom">Spem ofter, metum intende.</note> by Hope and Fear; for theſe are the Two Paſſions that ſpur them on, and therefore theſe muſt be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring them off. And therefore a Wiſe Governour will be ſure to be liberal both of his Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that ſo theſe Paſſions may not want Matter enough to feed upon; but then Care muſt be taken too, that they be ſo temper'd, as neither to encourage Preſumption, nor drive to Deſpair. A Fourth Remedy is, to ſow Diviſions among them, and break their Correſpondence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by making them Jealous, and Diſſatisfy'd at one another. A Fifth will be, To get ſome of the Party over by ſecret Service, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with Promiſes, and Penſions, and privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding what they privately do for your Advantage. And theſe Perſons thus gain'd, are to be diſpoſed in ſeveral Poſts. Some of them ſhould be drawn quite off, and come over to you, to weaken and intimidate them; Others ſhould be ſtill
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:53648:534"/>left behind to do your Buſineſs there, by giving Advice of all their Motions, and communicating their Intentions and Deſigns; by laying them aſleep by falſe Securities, and watching all Opportunities to qualifie their Fury. Then, Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Thoſe who cannot be got thus far, and are ſtill obſtinate, ſhould be cajoll'd by granting ſome part of what they demand, and giving them expectation of more; all which the expert Politicians will tell you, ſhould be by large Promiſes, worded cunningly, that ſo the Ambiguity of the Expreſſions may leave room for a colourable Evaſion afterwards: For a Prince may eaſily, when he ſees fit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke that which hath been extorted from him, and juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, what Injuſtice hath compell'd him to give hopes of obtaining. This is Caſuiſtical Policy at leaſt; but the only way to make it go down well with the People, is to varniſh all over with Gentleneſs and Clemency, and to make them ſome Amends by Indulgences of another kind, for thoſe Conceſſions, which without manifeſt Prejudice to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Government, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> he cannot but recede from. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If they ſhall return to a better Senſe of Things, and act agreeably to Reaſon and their Duty, they ſhould be dealt with tenderly; and a Prince may very well content himſelf with chaſtiſing ſome few of the firſt Authors, and principal Incendiaries, without giving himſelf the Trouble ſo much as to enquire after all the Accomplices; but managing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              <p>BY Tyranny we are to underſtand an Arbitrary, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Government, a Domineering over the Subjects with Violence and Rigour, without regard had to the Rules or Meaſures of Power, or the Cuſtoms and Privileges of the Country. This is frequently the Cauſe of publick Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and general Diſcontents, which by degrees grow up into Rebellion. And Rebellion is a Riſing of the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, provok'd by his Tyrannical and unjuſt Oppreſſions, with a deſign to dethrone, and drive him from his Royal Poſt. So that Rebellion differs from Sedition in This, that it no longer acknowledges, or ſubmits to the Prince as a Maſter and Governour; whereas Sedition does
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:53648:534"/>not go ſo far; but is diſſatisfy'd with the Adminiſtration, and aims not at changing the Perſon, but his Meaſures, and the Reformation of what it conceives amiſs. Now the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who thus degenerate into Tyranny, are Men of baſe Diſpoſitions, cruel in their Temper, Lovers and Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of wicked and turbulent People, and Miſchievous Pick-Thank Slaves, Paraſites and Sycophants, and doers of ill Offices. But for Perſons of Honour and Virtue, they have an inward Dread and Averſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Quibus ſemper aliena Virtus ſormidoloſa; Nobilitas, Opes, geſtique Honores pro crimine habentur; ob Virtutes certiſſimum exitium; &amp; non minus ex magnâ famâ quam malâ.</note>

                              <p>But theſe Tyrants are generally puniſh'd to purpoſe, and as they deſerve; for they are hated and deteſted, lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as common Enemies; they live in perpetual Terrors and Apprehenſions of the Revenge they have provok'd; every thing is ſuſpected and dreaded, and they never think themſelves ſafe; their own Conſciences turn their Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and all within is Scourges, and Racks, and Tortures; and at laſt they come to infamous and untimely Deaths; for the World hath ſeldom ſeen a Tyrant live to the fulneſs of Age, or die after the manner of common Men.</p>
                              <p>The Directions and Remedies proper for this Caſe, are largely inſiſted upon in another place. And the Summ of them may be reduc'd to theſe Two Points. Firſt, To hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Tyrant from getting the Power abſolutely into his own Hands, and oppoſe his Government at the firſt; but if this be not done, and he be actually poſſeſt of it, then to bear and ſubmit as well as we can.

                              <p>THE ſeveral publick Diſorders hitherto treated of, are but crude and imperfect; the Beginnings of Evils, and as it were Matter void of Form. But when Riot, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Sedition, or Rebellion is come to its full Maturity and Strength, when it hath all the Perfection it is capable of, and continues any time; then it Commences, and is call'd <hi>Civil War.</hi> For this is nothing elſe, but the taking up of Arms by Subjects, either againſt one another, which is the Caſe of the two Former; or elſe againſt the Prince or Magiſtrate, and then it is one of the two latter. Now there is not in the World a more Calamitous, more ſcandalous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It is not indeed a ſingle, but a complicated Evil, an Ocean of Evils. And a wiſe Author ſays very truly, that it cannot with any propriety of Speech be ſtyl'd a War, but is rather the Sickneſs, the Fever and Phrenzy of the State.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:53648:535"/>The wretched Authors of it, whoever they be, ought to be ſwept away from the Land of the Living, and driven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and without Mercy, from among Men. All manner of Wickedneſs is born and cheriſh'd under it; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Cruelty reign without controul; all Obligations of Humanity and Friendſhip are diſſolv'd; and the neareſt Ties of Blood and Natural Affection, broken and utterly loſt.

And this is a general Corruption and Looſneſs of Manners, Remiſſneſs in Diſcipline, and want of executing good and wholſome Laws for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all ſorts of People in their reſpective Duties. Hence the Vileſt and Reſuſe of the People take Advantage; and Men of deſperate Fortunes, who have no other Game to play, hope to find their Account, by putting all into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For, either they raiſe themſelves upon other Men's Ruines, and heal their own Extravagances by fiſhing in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Waters; or at leaſt they cover their own private in the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53648:536"/>Croud of publick Misfortunes. For, where a Man hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to loſe, it is ſome Mitigation to his Affliction, that it is general, and he does not fall alone. So the wiſe Hiſtorian Obſerves;<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſcere cuncta &amp; privata vulnera Reipublicae malis operire.

                              </p>
                              <p>Now, the Advice fit to be given in this Extremity, is, To make the quickeſt End that ſuch a War is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and for this there can be but two Ways; Treaty and Agreement, or Victory. The former is certainly the better, even though attended with ſome Hardſhip and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and ſhort of thoſe Advantagious Terms we deſire: For when once thoſe tumultuous Proceedings are quieted, Time will do the reſt for us. And a Man will do well ſometimes to ſuffer himſelf to be impoſed upon, when he is ſo largely paid for his Loſs. As it was ſaid of <hi>Antipater,</hi>
                                 <note n="†" place="bottom">Bellum ſinire cupienti opus erat decipi.</note> 
                                 <hi>That it was neceſſary to cheat him into a Peace, to gratific his Inclination when he was eager to put an end to the War.</hi> Victory is a very dangerous Concluſion, though a Succeſsful one. For there is great reaſon to ſear the abuſe of it, and that the gaining ſuch an Advantage may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire Inclinations to Tyranny, and Oppreſſion, and put migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty opportunities into a Prince's Hands, of ruling thoſe he hath ſubdued Arbitrarily and by Force, that ſo they may be effectually kept under ever after. But, to make ſure Work, it is neceſſary for a Prince to rid his Hands of the Principal Actors and Inſtigators of theſe Confuſions; and ſuch as he perceives to be Turbulent and Bloody-minded Men; without Regard to which Side they were of; for ſuch Diſpoſitions are always unſafe to be truſted. And This may be done conveniently enough under ſome fair Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of employing them in remoter Parts, or ſending them abroad into foreign Service; or elſe by dividing them, and breaking their Correſpondence; or keeping them in play againſt a Common Enemy; and then, for the Prevention of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:53648:537"/>any Diſcontents for the Time to come, to uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People well; and grant them all reaſonable Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; paſſing over what is already done by an Act of Oblivion, and miniſtring no juſt Occaſion of Jealouſie, but making his Government as eaſie as poſſible, in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Rights and Privileges for the future.</p>

                              <p>YOU have now taken a ſhort View of the ſeveral ſorts of Calamities and Confuſions, to which the State is Obnoxious, and heard the Directions proper for each of them, ſo far as the Prince himſelf is concerned; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now in the laſt Place, to conſider what Deportment will be proper and prudent for Perſons in a private Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, when any of theſe Troubles and Difficulties ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Now this cannot be diſpatched under any one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Topick; becauſe there are Two Scruples concerning it to be reſolved; The One, whether it be lawful and ſit for an honeſt and good Man, to fall in, and take the Part of ſome ſide or other in theſe Diviſions; or whether he ſhould rather keep himſelf quiet and ſit ſtill. The Other, what ſort of Behaviour is adviſable in either Caſe, that is, whether he do, or do not intereſs himſelf in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
                              <p>As to the former of theſe Two Queſtions; It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for the Satisfaction of ſuch, as are Looſe and at their own Diſpoſal, without any Engagements upon them, which ſhould determine them to either Party. For if they are already under any Obligations, This firſt Query does not in any Degree concern them; They are got beyond it already, and all the Doubts for Them to entertain, muſt receive Satisfaction from the Second Queſtion. I inſert this Caution by the way, becauſe it frequently falls out, that a Man is ſtaked down, as it were, to one party, almoſt whether he will or no. For, though he may not make it any part of his Choice and Deſign, nay, though, in his own Private Judgment, he cannot but diſapprove it; yet in deſpight of Intention, Inclination, and Good Senſe, he may find himſelf involved and intangled, by ſome Conſiderations ſo Powerful, that he cannot with any Decency break
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53648:537"/>through them: And theſe being ſuch Bands, as Nature hath ty'd him up in, or ſuch as Counterbalance all Motives to the contrary, will at leaſt carry a ſufficient Excuſe, for his doing as he does. Now, this firſt Queſtion hath ſeveral Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> and abundance of eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be produced, of Perſons who have behaved themſelves directly contrary to each other with regard to it. So that differing Judgments and Authorities, as well as different Reaſons, miniſter juſt ground of Scruple in the Caſe. The Reſolutions, which ſeem to me moſt convenient to be come to, according to the different Circumſtances of the Perſons concern'd in this Debate, are ſuch as follow.</p>
                              <p>On the one Hand, Nothing ſeems more agreeable to the Character of a Wiſe and a Good Man, than to have nothing at all to do with the Follies and Factions of the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a one cannot do better than to ſtand by, and let them try it out by themſelves. Eſpecially too, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what Account hath already been given of theſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, how irregular and unlawful they are in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and firſt Cauſes; what Wickedneſs, Barbarity, and Injuſtice of all ſorts they engage Men in. That theſe are inſeparable Attendants of ſuch practices, and it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have any hand in them, and continue Innocent; I ſay, If all theſe Conſiderations be fairly laid together, it ſcarce looks any longer like a Matter of free Choice, what a Man may, or may not do; but ſeems rather a Point of Duty, than of bare Allowance and Permiſſion, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to decline any Concern in them. And accordingly it appears that ſeveral excellent Perſons have had ſo great an abhorrence of theſe Things, and ſuch a Senſe of the Perſonal Obligations they violate, that no Conſiderations could prevail with them to come in; particularly <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> who, the Hiſtorian tells us,<note place="margin">Velleius, <hi>lib.</hi> 3.</note> excuſed himſelf for theſe very Reaſons to <hi>Aguſtus,</hi> when he entreated his Company and Aſſiſtance in the Expedition againſt <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But then on the other Hand, What ſhall we ſay to thoſe Reaſons, which enforce our Obligation, to take part with good Men, to protect and ſtrengthen ſuch, as much as in us lies, and to defend Equity and Right, againſt all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and encroach upon it? The Great <hi>Solon</hi> was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs'd in Favour of theſe Engagements, that he is for inflicting very ſevere Puniſhments, upon Them that affect Eaſe and Obſcurity, and refuſe to appear and act openly in ſuch Exigencies of State. And that rigid Profeſſor of Virtue, <hi>Cato</hi>
                                 <pb n="478" facs="tcp:53648:538"/>govern'd himſelf by this Rule; for he did not only declare, and come into One Party in the Civil Wars of <hi>Rome,</hi> but took a Command among the Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Now, if we would know, what Meaſures are fit to be taken, where Judgments are ſo divided, and Reaſons probable and plauſible enough for each to alledge in his own Juſtification; my poor Opinion is This: For Perſons of Eminence and Character in the World; ſuch as are in publick Truſt, or great Reputation, or extraordinary Abilities, and are known to be leading and ſignificant Men in the State, Theſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not only may fall into that Side, which they in their Conſcience think the beſt; but, ſo far as I am able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, they are bound to do it: For he is a very ill Pilot, that ſteers the Ship in calm and favourable Weather, and runs away from the Helm, when it grows Foul and Stormy: What ſhall become of the Veſſel, if the beſt Hands let her drive, when there is the greateſt Need of Working her, and keeping her tight? Theſe Gentlemen ought, in Extremities eſpecially, to ſtand in the Gap, and act like Men of Honour; the Care of the Government is upon them, and its Safety or Ruine lyes at the Door. But then, for Perſons in a private Capacity, ſuch as make none at all, or but very inconſiderable Figure in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Theſe are more at their own Liberty. For as their Condition ſuppoſes all the Aſſiſtance they can contribute, to be of no mighty conſequence, ſo the with-holding that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance can do no great Damage: And therefore they may be allowed to retire into ſome Place of Security, and ſeek their own Eaſe and Quiet, at a Diſtance, from the Noiſe and Clutter of the contending Parties. But then both theſe kind of Men, thoſe that do, and thoſe that do not declare, lie under an Obligation to demean themſelves, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I am going to preſcribe. In the mean while I add thus much only upon the preſent Subject, concerning thoſe who are diſpoſed to come in and act: That in the chooſing what Party they ſhould ſide with, ſometimes the Caſe is ſo plain, that it is almoſt impoſſible they can be miſtaken. For where the Injuſtice of the Cauſe, and other Diſadvantages are ſo evident, that they look one full in the Face, and forbid him; no Man of common Senſe will go in thither. But it often happens, that there are Reaſons on both Sides; Each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Right and Juſtice; and each hath Advantages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us; and then the Difficulty of coming to a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very great; becauſe a Man muſt not only weigh
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:53648:538"/>the Arguments on both Sides, and ſettle the Point of Right and Wrong firſt; but he hath ſeveral other Conſiderations to attend to, ſuch as may and ought to carry ſome Weight with them, though they have not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Juſtice of the Cauſe.</p>
                              <p>And now it may be Seaſonable to proceed to the other Part of this Advice; which relates to the Behaviour of the Perſons under theſe ſeveral Capacities. To all which, I might ſatisfie my ſelf with preſcribing in one Word, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Temper; that they would particularly take <hi>Atticus</hi> for their Pattern, whoſe Name hath been ſo much celebrated for his Prudence and Modeſty in the midſt of that boiſterous Age, in which he lived; One, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed in his Judgment to favour the right Side, and reſpected by all good Men for doing ſo; but yet one, who behaved himſelf ſo Prudently and Inoffenſively, that he never involved himſelf in the Common Confuſions, nor drew down the Diſpleaſure of ill Men, or any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience from that Party, who were ſenſible enough, he did not approve their Proceedings.</p>
                              <p>But, to be a little more particular; and firſt, for Them who openly declare themſelves; It is certain, that Theſe ought by no Means to be violent, or betray indecent Heats and Paſſions in their Converſation; but carry themſelves Modeſtly and Decently, and reſerve their Warmth for times of Action, or 'till ſome very juſt Occaſion happens to call for it. They ſhould not be Pert, nor Forward, nor Officiouſly thruſt themſelves upon Buſineſs, till they are required, and in ſome meaſure importuned; nay, compelled to it: For in ſuch Circumſtances no Man can be active without Odium; and therefore it is ſufficient that we obey our Call, and follow Duty, without being ſo eager, as to run before it, and ſtart of our own accord. But when we are called, and muſt act, then we ſhould take Care to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Execution of our Duty as little invidious as may be; to do all with ſuch Temper and Tenderneſs, that the Storm may fly over our Heads, and no angry Reſentments, or infamous Reflections remain behind; never inflaming, or in any Degree encouraging, much leſs allowing our ſelves in the Commiſſion of thoſe abominable Outrages and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences, uſual upon ſuch Occaſions; but employing our utmoſt endeavour to molliſie and ſweeten Men; to divert them from Injurious and Diſorderly Methods; and by all imaginable Arts trying to elude and break all Deſigns of this Nature.</p>
                              <pb n="480" facs="tcp:53648:539"/>
                              <p> Thoſe who have not declared themſelves openly by actually engaging in any Party (whoſe Circumſtances with regard to the Eaſineſs and Tranquility of them are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt much to be preferred before the former.) Thoſe, I ſay, who have given the World no viſible and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Teſtimony of their Affections to one or other Party, (though at the ſame time they may in their Own Breaſts be much more inclined, and wiſh better to the one than the other;) ought not to continue in a State of abſolute Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality. My Meaning is, that they ſhould not expreſs a perfect Indifference how Matters go, and have no Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude beyond their own private Affairs; for This is to ſit like Spectators at a Play-Houſe, and entertain themſelves with the Tragical Misfortunes of other People; which is a Coldneſs highly Criminal, where the Peace and Welfare of our Country lie at Stake. Such regardleſs Men as theſe, are juſtly deteſted by all Sides; and if their own Perſonal Safety be what they aim at, the Imagination is very vain; for no ſort of People run a greater Riſque, nor are worſe treated than They. We ſee what was the Fate of <hi>Thebes</hi> in the War with <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Judg. 21.8.</note> and of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Iſraclitiſh</hi> Judges. <hi>Livy</hi> hath obſerved very juſtly to this Purpoſe, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Neutralitas nec Amicos parit, nec Inimicos tollit.</note> 
                                 <hi>Neutrality ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes one Friend the more, nor one Enemy the leſs.</hi> It is indeed neither juſt nor becoming, and can never look well, or be ſo, except with Allowance of the Parties concerned. We ſee therefore what different Meaſures the Two great <hi>Roman</hi> Generals took in this Reſpect. <hi>Caeſar</hi> declared that he took it for granted, all that ſtood Neuter, were His Friends; <hi>Pompey</hi> declared he looked upon all ſuch as His Enemies. In a Stranger indeed this is very allowable; for he is under no Obligation to meddle in the Concerns of a Country that is none of his own; and ſo it is likewiſe in Perſons, whoſe Eminent Character and Quality may make it beneath them to become Parties, in ſuch Differences, which they ought rather to be adreſſed to us Umpires, and Mediators to determine.</p>
                              <p>Nor may Men; much leſs indeed may they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſickle and inconſtant; ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other; changing their Shape like <hi>Proteus,</hi> and in the worſt Senſe of the Words, becoming <hi>All things to all Men.</hi> Theſe are Mungrels, and as ſuch an odious and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:53648:539"/>deſpicable Breed; worſe than the former, who continue in a State of Neutrality; and more offenſive to All, while they make it their Buſineſs, to pleaſe and be more agreeable to All. For every man ought to act upon Principles, and to ſtick to ſomething.</p>
                              <p>But, though Men ought to incline to one ſide in their Wiſhes and Affections, becauſe Wiſhes and Affections are entirely our own; yet in their Actions and Deportment the Caſe is otherwiſe; theſe are what others have ſome Right and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in; and therefore, ſo far as relates to Converſation, theſe ought to be extended to all Parties in Common. There is a Title antecedent to all theſe accidental Differences and Diviſions, which they cannot diſannul; and therefore we are bound to be offenſive, injurious, rude and unconverſable to none; but to do Offices of Kindneſs, and Courteſie, and common Humanity to every Body, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Contrariety of Intereſts and Opinions. And thus far at leaſt all ſhould agree, to lament, and, as much as in them lies, to heal the publick Breaches and Misfortunes. Such Perſons ſecure themſelves from all the Inconveniences mentioned before; they create no new Enemies, and they loſe none of their old Friends. Theſe are Perſons of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fit to be employed as Mediators, and the moſt likely of any to ſucceed in bringing Matters to a fair and amicable Compoſition; which Thoſe who endeavour, do yet better, and are more ſerviceable, than They who content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Expreſſions of Courteſie and common Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to Men of all Parties indifferently. So then; It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears upon the whole Matter, that there may be Four ſorts of Perſons, who are not actually engag'd in any Party; Two of which are Blameable, and theſe are the Neuters or Indifferent, and the Veering or Unſteady; the other Two are uſeful and commendable; and Theſe are the Converſable or Courteous to All without Diſtinction; and the Mediators in Order to Agreement; But ſtill in each of theſe Kinds, One exceeds the other; the Inconſtant Man exceeds in Blame above the Neuter; and the Mediator in Merit and Commendation above the Common Friend. Of thoſe that declare and act openly, there are likewiſe Two ſorts, with the ſame Differences, the Eager and Violent, and the Moderate and Well-Temper'd.</p>

                              <p>IT may very reaſonably be expected, that I ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this Head of Prudence, without ſpeaking to one very frequent Difficulty more; which is, How Men ought to behave themſelves in the Quarrels or Miſunderſtandings of private Perſons, and particular Families. And here One is to conſider both what is moſt convenient for his own Affairs, and what can in reaſon be expected from him. If the Perſons thus at Enmity be ſuch as have no indiſpenſable Tie upon him, he may very fairly keep in with them both; and tho' perhaps he cannot love, or approve of both alike, yet he may, and will do well, to be obliging and kind to both, and give juſt Offence to neither. It is great Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in theſe Caſes, to engage ſo far with One Side, that they ſhall expect to have us entirely to themſelves, and think us bound in Honour and Friendſhip, to eſpouſe all their Intereſts, and make all their Reſentments our own: And therefore the better way will be to keep upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; to be content with a moderate Share of their Favour and good Graces. To ſay nothing in their Company tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Matter in controverſie; but to talk altogether of indifferent Things; or at leaſt ſuch as we perſonally know to be true, or are otherwiſe very well aſſur'd of: If we touch upon the Diſpute, to ſay what may be for the Service of both, and may tend to their reconciliation, and better Underſtanding. But by no means ſubmitting to that vile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of reporting idle Stories, or groundleſs Surmiſes; or aggravating things that have ſome Foundation; or currying Favour by diſcommending or railing at the Adverſary of Him with whom we converſe. For Matters here ought to be carry'd with ſuch an even Hand, that nothing ſhould paſs in Company with the one, which we would not ſpeak, if the other were by; nay, that nothing ſhould be ſaid to the one, which we would not ſay to the other in his Turn too; allowing only for ſome little Alterations in the Forms and Manner of our Addreſs; which the different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Perſons, or the Relation or Authority we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to with them, or ſome other accidental Conſideration, foreign to the Subject of the Quarrel it ſelf, may render ſeaſonable, and ſeem to require from us.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> JUSTICE conſiſts in rendring to every one whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Right belongs to him; <note place="margin">What it is.</note> paying firſt to himſelf his Own Duty, and then to others Theirs. And, according to this Definition, it comprehends all manner of Duties and Offices, which each particular Perſon can be any way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to. Now theſe, as I hinted before, are of Two ſorts, according to the Objects of them, which are Two: The Firſt terminate in a Man's own Perſon; the Second in other People: All which in their utmoſt Latitude ſall within the compaſs of that moſt extenſive Command, which hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the Subſtance and Summ of all Juſtice, in thoſe very few, but ſignificant Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> For here it is very obſervable, that the Duty to others is put in the Second place; that the Love and Duty we owe to our ſelves is laid as the Ground-work upon which that to our Neighbour is ſuperſtructed, and the Model by which it is to be proportion'd. For, as the old <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and not They only, but all the World uſe to ſay, <hi>Charity begins at home.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Beginning then, and Foundation of all Juſtice, is to be ſought for within our ſelves;<note place="margin">Primitive and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtice.</note> and the moſt Ancient and Fundamental Right of all others, is that Dominion, which Reaſon hath over the Senſual part of us. A Man muſt be able to command and govern himſelf, before he can be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd to exerciſe this Authority, in demanding Subjection from others. And this Government of one's Self conſiſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to Reaſon the Power of bearing Sway, and keeping the Appetites under; reducing and reſtraining them to their juſt Meaſures and Degrees, and bowing their ſtubborn Necks, till they become flexible, and obedient to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The preſerving our Souls in this Order and Poſture, is what we may call, <hi>Primitive. Original,</hi> and <hi>Internal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
                              <pb n="484" facs="tcp:53648:541"/>the moſt genuine, the brighteſt, and infinitely moſt beautiful, of any thing that goes by that Name. This So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Dominion of the Rational, over that ſenſual and brutiſh part of the Soul, which is the Source of all our Paſſions, and by Them of all our Troubles and Diſorders, hath been by ſome Authors not unfitly reſembl'd to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der managing his Horſe; keeping himſelf firm in the Saddle, and the Rein conſtantly in his Hand; by which he rules and turns the Beaſt under him at pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To give an exact and nice Account of that Juſtice, <note place="margin">Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> which goes abroad, and is exercis'd in our Dealings with other People, it is neceſſary to obſerve firſt of all, that there are two ſorts of it. The One Natural, Univerſal, Generous, and Brave, Rational and Philoſophical; the Other in a great degree Artificial, Particular, Poſitive, and Political; contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and cramp'd up, according as the Exigencies of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Countries and Conſtitutions would allow it a larger, or have confin'd it to a narrower Compaſs. The Former of theſe is much the more regular and uniform, more firm and inflexible, clearer and fairer of the Two: But alas! it is antiquated and obſolete, capable of doing very little Service to the World, as it now ſtands. This occaſion'd that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,<note n="*" place="bottom">Veri Juris germanaeque Juſtitiae ſolidam &amp; expreſſam eſſigiem nullam tenemus; umbris &amp; imaginibus utimur.</note> 
                              <hi>That the Subſtance and expreſs Image of true Right and Juſtice was long ſince fled and gone; and all we live by now, is only ſome faint Shadows, and imperfect Copies of that Original Repreſentation, taken from the Life it ſelf.</hi> Theſe are like the firſt Sketches of a Night-piece; but they are ſuch as Mankind muſt be contented with, ſince, tho' the Darkneſs of their Condition need a ſtronger Light, yet their preſent Infirmities cannot bear any thing ſo exquiſitely bright. This is what they ſay of <hi>Polycletus</hi>'s Rule, Inflexible, Unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The other is more ſlack, and limber, and pliable; it comes to, and accommodates it ſelf to the Neceſſities and the Weakneſſes of Mankind, nay of the generality; and That to be ſure is the worſt and moſt ignorant part. This is a Leaden and a <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule, a Noſe of Wax, that bends into any Form, and may be wrought into any Figure; and indeed is bow'd and chang'd perpetually, according to the different Exigencies and Circumſtances of Time, and Place, and Perſon; the Poſture of Affairs, and the variety of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. This in caſe of neceſſity and convenience diſpenſes
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53648:541"/>with, allows, nay approves of ſeveral things, which the other will not ſo much as connive at, but muſt abſolutely condemn, and cannot admit upon any Conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. This eſtabliſhes ſome Vices, and gives them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Countenance, but ſometimes the Sanction of a Law; and rejects ſeveral Actions in themſelves Innocent and Good, as unlawful and not to be practis'd. Natural Juſtice looks only at the Reaſon, the Equity, the Virtue, the Decency and Fitneſs of the thing: But Poſitive and Political Juſtice proceeds upon other ſort of Conſiderations; it hath a great, I might almoſt ſay, principal Regard, to the Advantage, the Convenience; at leaſt its main Aim and Buſineſs is to reconcile theſe two, and make Profit and Probity go Hand in Hand, and ſo mutually promote and aſſiſt each other. Since therefore This is the only kind, which the World is manag'd by, and the Deſign of the preſent Treatiſe is to reform Men's Manners, and to better them in ſuch Points as are practicable, we will confine our ſelves wholly to this latter ſort. For it muſt needs be to very little purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the Former; of which there is nothing now but the <hi>Idea</hi> and bare Speculation left.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now this Juſtice at preſent in common uſe, <note place="margin">Of Juſtice as now in uſe.</note> and that which is eſteem'd the Judge and Standard of Human Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is firſt of all Twofold, with regard to the Rules and Meaſures of it. The One is what we call Legal Juſtice, becauſe it is bound up by the Terms and Letter of the Law; and this is that Rule which Magiſtrates and Judges are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to determine, and proceed by. If any Injury be, as there often is great Injury done or ſuffer'd by ſuch Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, They who paſs the Sentence are in no degree account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it; becauſe their Buſineſs is not to make the Law, but to be govern'd by, and act according to the Law; and ſo there is no help, but they muſt take it, as it lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The Other is term'd <hi>Equitable Juſtice;</hi> and this hath a larger Range allow'd it; it is not fetter'd up to Words and Syllables, but hath a Liberty left to conſider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigency, the Circumſtances of the Perſon, the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of his Caſe; and ſo can adminiſter Relief, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Point in Diſpute, in a Latitude, not only beyond, but ſometimes even above and contrary to the Letter of the Law. Or indeed, to ſpeak more properly, This Equity over-rules and manages the Law to the beſt Advantage, and directs it ſo, as to anſwer its proper End, by making the Execution of the Law agreeable to the Intention, and
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:53648:542"/>the Reaſons of Enacting of it. Upon this account it is, that a Wiſe Man ſaid very truly, That Laws and Juſtice were not ſufficient of themſelves, unleſs they fell into good Hands, and were juſtly and skilfully manag'd; that is, unleſs their Sentence proceed upon equitable Conſiderations. And this larger and freer way of Proceeding is the peculiar Province of the Supreme Judge; the Prince in Perſon, or thoſe, who in the Conſtruction and Practice of the Law, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd by him for this purpoſe, and ſo equivalent in all they do to his own doing it. For his Authority is preſent, tho' his Perſon be not; and this is the more effectual, more powerful Preſence of the Two.</p>
                           <p>Again, if we deſcend to conſider this Juſtice more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, there will another Diviſion offer it ſelf to us, with regard to the different Methods of Proceeding. One of which is call'd <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> becauſe it conſiſts in buying and ſelling, bargaining, and all manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; for the ſeveral kinds of This are reduc'd to that one general Practice, of trucking and bartering one thing for another. And this is the Juſtice in exerciſe among pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men; the Rule whereof is Arithmetical Proportions; for our Care is to make what we give and what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in exchange, of equal value. The other is <hi>Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice;</hi> and this is adminiſtred by the Publick, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments: The Rule whereof is Geometrical Proportion; wherein an exact and nice Equivalent is not aim'd at, nor juſt the Merit and Quality of the Fact, and nothing elſe attended to; but ſeveral other Conſiderations taken in: And the laſt Reſult of the whole Debate is this, What, upon a fair Computation of all Circumſtances put together, is reaſonable and fitting for the One to give, or to award; and for the Other to receive, or to ſuffer.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now this Juſtice at preſent in common uſe, <note place="margin">No ſuch thing as ſtrict and true Juſtice in the World.</note> when it comes to be cloſely and critically examin'd, will be found to be no ſuch thing, as ſtrict and perfect Juſtice. For the Truth is, as I ſaid before, Human Nature is not capable of ſuch a thing; it is too reſin'd for our groſs Condition, and we cannot bear this, or any other thing in its abſtracted Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Purity. In all practicable Juſtice there is a Mixture of Injuſtice, Favour, and Rigour; Too much and too little; theſe, like the Allay in our Coin, are properly call'd the <hi>Remedy;</hi> for ſuch indeed they are to the corrupt and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate State of Mankind. There is no ſuch thing as pute and true Standard current among us; that exact Mediocrity,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:53648:542"/>which we can only form, and truly now can ſcarce form in our Imaginations. Hence proceed thoſe Maxims of the Ancients, That he who deſigns to do Juſtice in the Groſs, will find himſelf under an unavoidable Neceſſity to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in the Retail; for no general Rule can be conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferv'd, but ſome particular Perſons and Caſes will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aggriev'd by it. And He, that will be juſt in great and important Occaſions, muſt ſometimes be unjuſt in thoſe of leſs Conſequence. Theſe are Difficulties ſo well known, ſo generally felt and confeſt, that in Matters of Commerce and <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> ſome Lawgivers heretofore were forc'd, in order to the bringing the Buſineſs of Trade under ſome Rule, and reſtraining the Exorbitancies of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to give leave for Men to cheat to ſome certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, (as for inſtance, Not to exceed half of what the Commodity was really worth,) without being liable to the Law. And this they were forc'd to connive at, becauſe they cou'd fix it no better. Again, In the Caſe of <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice,</hi> How many innocent Perſons are clapp'd up? How many guilty acquitted and releas'd? And all this without any Corruption or Fault of the Judges? And to how much greater a Summ would this Account ſwell, if to unjuſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations and Acquittals, we ſhould add the Exceſſes and Defects in Puniſhments, how much more or leſs hath been awarded, than the Sufferer really deſerved? For This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the conſtant daily Failure, even where Juſtice is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred with the cleaneſt Hands, and moſt unblemiſh'd Integrity of Heart. Juſtice indeed perplexes and hinders it ſelf; and the greateſt and moſt acute Underſtanding cannot penetrate into the bottom of Things. To ſee, and make Proviſion againſt all Inconveniences, requires Abilities and Providence more than Human.</p>
                           <p>But, that we may not be thought to complain without cauſe, and ſhelter our ſelves in Generals, I will now give an Inſtance, and that a very conſiderable one, wherein <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice</hi> ſeems to me to fall exceeding ſhort: And that is, In inflicting Puniſhments when Men do amiſs, but not providing any Rewards to diſtinguiſh thoſe that do well; and that too, notwithſtanding the diſpenſing of theſe two, are the two great Branches, and, as it were, the two Hands of Juſtice; and yet, as This is commonly exercis'd in Courts of Judicature, Juſtice is maim'd, and cripled, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines altogether to the puniſhing ſide. The greateſt Favour we can hope to receive from this lame Goddeſs, is Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:53648:543"/>and a Manifeſtation of our own Innocence: And this alaſs! is Short Commons; a poor Allowance for thoſe to ſubſiſt upon, who have ſignaliz'd themſelves by eminent and difficult Virtues. But This, as bad as it is, is not the worſt of the Matter; for I will put you another Caſe that happens every Day. You ſhall be inform'd againſt, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, indicted wrongfully, and under theſe Calumnies ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer exceedingly, in your Perſon, your Purſe, your Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you are brought to Tryal, and acquitted; This you will ſay makes ſome, tho' but ſome Amends neither, to your Credit: Your Innocence is proclaim'd to all the World: And what now is the Fruit of all this Suffering and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence? Why you eſcape the Severity of the Law: A good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Satisfaction indeed! a Man is not puniſh'd that never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it. But where is the Reparation for all the Trouble and Charge you have been at? for This will ſtick by you, and can never be wip'd off, tho' the Suſpicion, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and all the Dirt that a falſe Accuſer beſpatter'd you with, may. The Plantiff or Informer in the mean while, if he can but bring the leaſt Colour of probability for what he depos'd againſt you, comes off clear; and a very eaſie thing it is, to make any thing look ſo ſuſpicious, as ſhall ſuffice to prevent the recovering of Damages upon him: So very niggardly, ſo ſhamefully miſerable is Juſtice in the Matter of Rewards, and gratifying Men for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd well; and ſo entirely addicted to Puniſhment. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that now the Word is brought to ſignifie That by way of Eminence, and doing Juſtice, or being obnoxious to Juſtice, is conſtantly underſtood in the rigorous Senſe, as if Juſtice had nothing elſe to do, but to ſcourge, and take Men off. And any Man, whoſe Diſpoſition is litigious, and his Malice and Conſcience wicked enough to put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, may very eaſily give his Neighbours a great deal of Trouble and Charge; and without any danger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, run them into ſuch Difficulties, as will not be poſſible to get quit of again, without conſiderable Detriment and Diſquiet.</p>
                           <p>Now if we would conſider Juſtice, as to the ſeveral parts of our Duty, and the Objects in which they terminate; theſe are principally Three. For every Man is, by virtue of his Nature and Condition, a Debtor to God, to Himſelf, and to his Neighbour: So that One of his Creditors is above him; Another is upon the level with him; and the Third is Creditor and Debtor both in one Perſon. The Duty to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53648:543"/>God is but another Phraſe for Piety and Religion; ſo that this Head of Juſtice hath been largely inſiſted upon already, in the Second Part of this Treatiſe. And therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling the Reader any more upon that Subject, I ſhall betake my ſelf to the other Two yet behind; the Duty to our Selves, and That to our Neighbour.</p>

                           <p>THis indeed is ſcatter'd throughout this whole Work, and every Chapter is full of it.

So that any thing induſtriouſly apply'd to this Topick in particular, might perhaps be well enough ſpar'd. But however, I will here lay down ſome Directions, and give the Matter an expreſs and ſolemn Conſideration, in the moſt compendious Method that conveniently I can.
<list>
                                 <item>1. The Firſt Advice I ſhall give upon this Occaſion, and that which in truth is the Foundation of all the reſt, is, That Men would bethink themſelves, and take up a Reſolution not to live <hi>Extempore,</hi> and at Random, from Hand to Mouth, and without any Reflection of what they are, what will become of them, and why they are here; and yet, as extravagant as all this may ſeem at firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the greateſt part of Mankind by far are guilty of it. They fool away their Time, and never live in good earneſt; but paſs Day after Day, without one ſerious Thought, or troubling themſelves to look at all before them. They have no Reliſh, no Enjoyment of Life; nor make any other uſe of it, but only to employ it in unneceſſary Trifles, and Things by the by. Their mighty Projects, and buſie Cares are rather a Hindrance and Perplexity, than any Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the great Ends of Living: Such Men do every
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53648:544"/>thing in earneſt, but live. All their Actions, and the little broken Parcels of Life, are grave and full of Attention; but the Bulk and Subſtance of Life goes off without any Regard or Conſideration at all. This is like a Self-evident Principle, or a Truth taken for granted in Speculation; upon which they never beſtow a Second Thought. That which is Accidental and Inſignificant is made their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Care; and that which ought to be their main Buſineſs, neglected, as if it were only an Additional and Unneceſſary thing. They are exceeding diligent, and importunately ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous in other Matters; ſome in acquiring a vaſt compaſs of Learning; ſome in aſpiring to Honours and Preferments; ſome in heaping up Riches: Others are intent upon Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Diverſions; Hunting, or Play, or vain Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to paſs away their Time, as if This were a Burden, and hung upon their Hands: Others are taken up in uſeleſs Speculations, fanciful Notions, pretty Inventions: Others ſet up for Men of Buſineſs, and ſpend all their Days in Hurry and Noiſe: Others purſue Deſigns different from all theſe: But amidſt this vaſt Variety of Follies, few or none apply themſelves to the true Wiſdom, by ſtudying how to live indeed. They are Thoughtful and Anxious, entirely given up to, and eager of many Matters; but Life ſlips through their Fingers inſenſibly, and is turn'd to no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. This is only in the Nature of a Term; a ſet Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of Time appointed to follow other Buſineſs in. Now all this is extremely injurious and unreaſonable; the Source of our greateſt Miſery; the falſeſt and baſeſt way of betraying our ſelves, and abandoning our true Intereſt: It is perfectly loſing and throwing away our Life, and the moſt perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as well as the moſt fatal Breach of Duty we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be guilty of. For certainly every Man owes thus much to Himſelf, Not to triſle, and be wanting in his greateſt Concern; To make Life as eaſie, as cheerful, as deſirable, as good to himſelf as he can; which is to be done no other way, but by making the moſt of it in point of Uſefulneſs, and good Management. For Living well and adviſedly is the only Expedient in order to dying ſo; and This is the great Task incumbent upon all Mortals. We ought to look upon Life as a Matter of the laſt Conſequence; a precious Talent; an important Truſt, of which we muſt render a ſtrict and very particular Account; and therefore are bound to husband it thriſtily, and improve it to the utmoſt of our Power; that we may be found faithful in our Stewardſhip,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:53648:544"/>and gain by the Increaſe. This is our Great Concern; All the reſt are Toys and Geugaws in compariſon; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and very ſuperficial Advantages. I cannot deny indeed, but ſome there are, who beſtow ſome Thought of this kind, and pretend to ſet about it with marvellous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: But then this Thoughtfulneſs comes too late, and they begin to live when they are juſt going to die. Like fooliſh Chapmen, who put off their Bargains till the Shops are ſhut, and then complain of an ill Market. What, ſay they, ſhall I never get an Opportunity of retreating from the World, and living to ſome Purpoſe? Alas!<note n="*" place="bottom">Quam ſerum eſt incipere vivere, cum deſinendum eſt! quam ſtulta mortalitatis oblivio! Dum differtur vita tranſcurrit.</note> 
                                    <hi>How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable is it to begin to live, when we can live no longer! What ſtrange Infatuation makes us thus forget, that we are Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal! While we put off to a farther Day, and intend to take up hereafter; that very Life which ſhould have been employ'd, is loſt and gone.</hi> So good reaſon had all the Wiſe Men of Old to call upon us ſo often and ſo loudly, to make the beſt of our Time, and loſe no Opportunities; ſo juſt is That Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That of all the Neceſſaries of Life, Time is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the moſt indiſpenſable; what they who want, and are prodigal of, undo themſelves to all Intents and Purpoſes. The ſhortneſs of Life, and the length of Art, is not more properly apply'd to the Study of Phyſick, and the Art of Healing, than it is to the Art of Living. For this is an Art too, and ſuch as cannot be maſter'd without long Study, and great Application of Mind. This is the true, the only Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and therefore this preſent Direction is the firſt and moſt concerning; thoſe that follow are but ſo many Deductions from, and Helps to it.</item>
                                 <item>2. The Next is, That we would learn to dwell alone; to be eaſie when by our ſelves; and, if Occaſion ſo require, well content to be deprived of the Company, and Comfort of all the World. It is an extraordinary Attainment, to know how to enjoy one's ſelf; and a Virtue as well as Advantage to take Satisfaction and perfect Content in that Enjoyment. Let us therefore ſet about it in good Earneſt, and never reſt 'till we have gain'd this Point upon our ſelves; The conquering all our Fondneſſes, and uneaſie Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after the Converſation of others, and the taking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in converſing with our own Souls; That ſo our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment may depend upon our ſelves alone, and not upon
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53648:545"/>other People, nor upon any thing without us. But, though we ſhould not ſeek Converſation as our Happineſs, and what we cannot want; yet muſt not this Self-ſatisfaction degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a cynical Moroſeneſs, or a proud affected Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. It is a Fault to refuſe, or to diſdain the Company of our Friends; This is what we ought not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but to be glad of, and good Humoured in; allowing and practiſing all thoſe Diverſions, which pleaſant Diſcourſe, and innocent Mirth are able to give us. My Meaning is only to keep Men from being Slaves to thoſe Diverſions, and unable to reliſh any Pleaſure without them; and ſuch are a great part of the World, almoſt quite loſt, and ſadly to ſeek, what to do with themſelves, when they are alone. Now every Man ought to be ſufficiently provided at Home for his own Entertainment; and he is very poorly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, who cannot ſubſiſt upon his private Stock for one Day at leaſt. But the Man, who hath brought himſelf to do ſo every Day, and needs be beholding to no body for his Suſtenance and Satisfaction of this kind, is ſure to be always Happy, always pleas'd. 'Tis true; In the midſt of all this, he ought to be Civil and Complaiſant; to put on an Air of Gaiety, or Buſineſs, comply with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and do as they do; ſubmit to the Neceſſity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and follow when that calls; in a Word, it will be his Prudence to accommodate his Temper and Behaviour to any Thing that may happen; but howſoever thoſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations may alter his outward Appearance, and oblige him to make different Figures in the Eye of the World; to put on all Humours, and ſhift his Manner, as oft as the Scene changes; yet ſtill at Home, and within himſelf he muſt be always the ſame. This is the Effect of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſerious Thought, which is indeed the Food, the Life, the Eſſence of the Soul. And it is a remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, how kind Nature hath been to us, that what we thus live upon, is the moſt frequent, the moſt laſting, the moſt eaſie and natural Employment of our Souls; for Thought is always with us, and moſt truly our own.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>But, though all Men's Minds are employed, yet is not the Employment eaſie to all alike; nor the Matter they are employed upon, the ſame. In ſome, this Entertainment of themſelves is mere Impotence and Childiſhneſs; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Idleneſs and Sloth, the want of Buſineſs, and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effect of having nothing elſe to do: But Great Souls make it their Choice, they court and covet the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:53648:545"/>for it, look upon it as their main Buſineſs, and moſt improving Study. And therefore they ply it cloſe with their utmoſt Application, and Intenſeneſs of Thought; their Faculties are all at Work, and, as was ſaid of <hi>Scipio,</hi> they are never leſs alone, than when they are by themſelves; never more full of Buſineſs than when retreated from the World, and ſequeſtred from all that Men commonly call ſuch. This, ſo far as Humane Nature can aſpire to the Reſemblance of ſo bright an Excellence, is to imitate Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; for He lives, and feeds upon the Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of his own Mind; And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gueſſed right, when he laid down this conſtant Employment, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Happineſs, both of the Divine and Humane Nature. For Self-ſufficiency, and Self-ſatisfaction, are but other Words for Happineſs; and Theſe are never to be had, never to be taſted, but by learning to employ, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our ſelves well with our own Thoughts.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But then in order hereunto great regard muſt be had to the Choice of ſit Subjects for the Mind to dwell upon. For ſome People make ſo very ill Uſe of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Retreat into themſelves, that they are their own worſt Tempters, and Company is their beſt Preſervation. To the Intent therefore, that this Meditation may be an Employment indeed, and this Entertainment delightful; like His whoſe Image our Souls are, we muſt take Care not to trifle away our Time in vain Thoughts, and much more ſtill, not to miſpend it in Vice. The Firſt is ſure to do us no manner of Good, the Second a great deal of Harm. Some grave ſevere Study, ſome uſeful profound Knowledge, ſome Contrivance how to improve and exalt our Minds, and make our ſelves better Men, ſhould be our great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and Concern. God hath given us Reaſon and Comprehenſion; and a large Poſſeſſion, a Rich Soil it is; but the manuring, and cultivating, and making it fruitful is our Duty; the principal Task incumbent upon every Man; what the Laws of Nature and Religion have covenanted for; and what each of us muſt expect to give an Account of. It highly concerns us therefore to be ſerious and vigilant, to look narrowly into our ſelves; and ſee how Matters ſtand with us; to call in our Cares and Endeavours unprofitably ſpent abroad, and try to turn theſe to better Account, by laying them out upon Buſineſs more Important at Home. And when, upon Examination, we find, (as find we ſhall) that many things are out of Courſe, and go much amiſs;
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:53648:546"/>Some through the Corruption of Vice; Others from ſome defect in Nature; a Third by Reaſon of the Infection we have taken from Ill Company; a Fourth upon the Account of ſome Accident that diſorders and confounds us; when, I ſay, we ſhall thus perceive our ſeveral Failings, and the true Cauſes of them diſtinctly; our next Endeavour muſt be, to go conſiderately to work; correcting what was out of Order, providing againſt the like Inconveniences, and cutting off the Occaſions that drew us into Danger, for the time to come. A Man is by all means bound to bring himſelf to Reaſon, and though the Oppoſition made by unruly Appetites, and vicious Habits may be very great, and the Difficulties very diſcouraging, yet Reformation is a Work that muſt be done. And therefore a Man ought to ſet about it with Reſolution; to bow the ſtubborn Neck of his Paſſions, whatever it coſt him; and not let all run to ruine, and loſe himſelf by Cowardice, or Sloth, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful, unthinking Careleſſneſs.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And indeed above all things a Man ſhould beware of a ſluggiſh, ſantring Way of Life; for To do Nothing, is to do All; the Soul gathers Ruſt by lying Idle and our of Uſe; and the Way to preſerve our Minds as well as our Bodies in Health and Strength, is to keep them in Breath by conſtant Exerciſe, and Employment. And here too, the Preſcription holds, that the Exerciſe ſhould not be too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and laborious. There is no Occaſion for a conſtant Intenſeneſs of Thought; but it ought to be wholeſome and fit for them; that our Thoughts ſhould be Serious and Grave, Virtuous and Becoming. And if there be not enough of this kind laid ready to our Hands, we ought rather to cut out Work for our ſelves, than not be doing at all. And thus we may conſult our own Genius; and form ſuch Deſigns as may give us Pleaſure and Entertainment, as well as find us Buſineſs; we may read good Books; confer with good Men; and eaſily contrive to lay out our Time ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, and in Method; as never to be in a Hurry, never at a Loſs what to do next, or how to diſpoſe of our ſelves to very good Advantage.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Another good Direction will be, To manage all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences ſo prudently, that all that offers, all that is done, or ſaid may turn to Account; To learn ſomewhat from every Company we come into, from every Action and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to take ſome warning, lay down ſome Rule, make ſome Application, and bring the Matter home to our ſelves,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:53648:546"/>and all this in a way ſo ſilent, that no body ſhall perceive it. For all the Attempts of this kind grow nauſeous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, if we ſuffer them once to be corrupted with Noiſe, and Vanity, and Affectation.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But to be a little more particular. We cannot but be ſenſible, that as a Man hath Three things to take care of, as either Eſſential Parts of, or neceſſary Appendages to his Perſon; ſo the Duty, which every one is obliged to himſelf in, is the regulating and wiſe Management of his Mind, his Body, and his Goods. As for the Mind, (which is the Firſt and Principal, and for the Uſe and Benefit whereof thoſe general Rules already laid down, are after a more peculiar manner calculated) All it's Operations, we know, may be reduced to theſe Two, Cogitation, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition; conſequently the Two great Faculties to be cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are the Underſtanding and the Will; and the Fruits to be reaped from our Care and Pains, the Ornaments and Excellencies of the Soul are, Knowlege and Virtue. As to the former of theſe, the Underſtanding; there are Two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Extremes, and in ſome Senſe indeed Contraries to each other, from which we ſhould uſe all poſſible Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it untainted. The Firſt of theſe is Folly; by which I underſtand all ſorts of Vanity, empty and inſignificant Imaginations, Fopperies and Trifles, ſuch as are excuſable only in Children, but unworthy the Character, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Dignity of a Man; For This Noble Creature was not made to play the Fool;<note n="*" place="bottom">Non ad jocum &amp; luſum genitus, ſed ad ſeveritatem potiùs.</note> Jeſt and Sport may be his Recreation, but he is qualify'd and deſign'd for Greater Things. Seriouſneſs and ſevere Thought are his Buſineſs, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Weight and Importance expected from him. In the other part of my Diviſion, I likewiſe include all fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, abſurd, and extravagant Opinions; vulgar Errours, and unreaſonable Prejudices. For as Vanity debaſes the Soul, damps it's Vigour, adulterates and baſtardiſes its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Greatneſs; ſo Prepoſſeſſion and raſh Miſtakes, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and diſhonour, and leave an Eternal Blemiſh upon it. We muſt therefore feed and cheriſh this Noble Creature, with Entertainment ſuitable to its generous Appetite and Nature; that is, with ſerious, ſubſtantial Studies, ſuch as may be ſerviceable, and turn to ſome Account; we muſt tincture and ſoak it well (if I may ſo ſay) in Sound, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Notions, ſuch as are conformable to the Dictates of
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53648:547"/>pure Nature, and right Reaſon; and our Care ſhould be not ſo much to exalt, and refine, and fly it high, to render it Vigorous and Strong, Acute and Nice; as to regulate and methodize it, that all its Reaſonings may be ſtanch; its Concluſions true, its Motions orderly, and its Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions virtuous: For the doing Things Pertinently and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in due Method, and Time, and Meaſure, is the Effect of Wiſdom, and that which makes the Soul and it's Attainments truly valuable. And here again great Care muſt be taken to keep our ſelves from Pertneſs and Self-conceit, Poſitiveneſs and Preſumption; all which are Vices exceeding common among Men of acute Parts, and a lively ſtrong Mind. It would be much wiſer to put a Check upon our Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to proceed ſlowly and deliberately; to be content to live in Doubt, and ſuſpend our Judgment, and confeſs our Ignorance, in ſuch Matters eſpecially, as are controverted, and commonly oppoſed; where Reaſon is confronted with Reaſon, and Authority with Authority; and theſe two ſo plauſible, ſo ſtrong on both Sides, that they ask Time and Skill to conſider and digeſt them thoroughly. Nor is This a mean Accompliſhment, or below the Character of the Perſon I pretend to inſtruct. For, let my Reader be well aſſured, it is a great Thing and a very valuable Quality, to know how to be Ignorant with Modeſty and Decency; and keeping ones ſelf in Doubt and ſuſpenſe is the ſureſt and ſafeſt Way to true Knowledge. This is what the moſt celebrated Philoſophers always pretended to do; and indeed it is one of the faireſt and moſt generous Fruits of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a well diſciplined Mind.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. As for the Will; This muſt be brought under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and made to ſubmit it ſelf in every Thing to the Directions of Right Reaſon. And the reducing, it thus to Subjection is the Office of Virtue, which tames and ſubdues it, and inclines its Ear to this wiſe Guide, by drawing off its Attention and Inclination from the Seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vain, fickle, and commonly falſe Opinions, and by delivering it from the Tyranny of Paſſion. For Theſe are the Three Principles, ſome of which always puſh on our Souls to Action, and preſide over them in it; but They, who are under either of the latter, are loſt and miſerable to the laſt Degree. For, do but obſerve the mighty Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them. The wiſe Man maintains his Poſt; and hearkens to the true Word of Command; the Dictates of his Mind, which are agreeable to Nature and Reaſon;
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:53648:547"/>he keeps his Eye conſtantly upon his Duty, and regards not what he is diſpos'd to by his Frailties and Corruptions, but what by the Law he is oblig'd to do. Whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion would perſuade him to, he always ſuſpects for ſpurious; whatever Paſſion would prompt him to, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rejects and condemns. And the Effect of This is, that he lives at Eaſe and Quiet, finds Peace always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, goes on ſmoothly, and without diſturbance; is never driven to any neceſſity of altering his Meaſures, or acting in contradiction to himſelf, or repenting of what he had done; for, let the Event be what it will, yet his Methods were right and proper; he choſe the beſt, and made the moſt of his preſent Circumſtances. And then, another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he gains too, which is, to do nothing with Heat and Violence; for Reaſon is a Cool and Calm Principle. Whereas, on the other hand, the fooliſh Man, who gives himſelf up to the other Two, is exorbitant and uncertain; all his Motions are excentrick and wild; he is in perpetual Confuſion, at War with himſelf, and hath no Eaſe, no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. He is doing and undoing, taking new Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, beginning again, repenting and condemning what is paſt, unſteady in all his Reſolutions, and diſſatisfy'd with his own Choice. For indeed none but the Wiſe Man can ever be fix'd and contented; and all other Principles but Reaſon and Virtue are too feeble, too ſickle to ſettle or to ſatisfie us.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nulla placidior Quies niſi quam Ratio compoſuit.</note>

                           <p n="8">8. The Body comes next to be conſider'd; and to This we owe our Aſſiſtance and good Management. 'Tis a vain and ridiculous Attempt, to ſeparate theſe two principal parts of our Perſons, and pretend to lay out all our Care and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs upon the one, to the Prejudice and Defrauding of its Fellow: On the contrary, a good Underſtanding, and mutual Kindneſs ought to be maintain'd between them;
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:53648:548"/>that by reciprocal Offices they may be ſtill more cloſely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd, more intimately joyn'd. Nature hath beſtow'd a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon us, as our neceſſary Receptacle and Inſtrument of Life; and therefore the Soul, which is the Principal, ought to take the Guardianſhip and Protection of it. It muſt not enſlave it ſelf to the Body, 'tis true, for This were to draw the baſeſt, moſt unjuſt, moſt diſhonourable and reproachful of all Servitudes upon its own Head; but it is bound to ſuccour, to direct, to adviſe, and to perform the part of an affectionate Husband, to this Fleſh which Providence hath married it to. Care and Love is its due, tho' Submiſſion be not; and the Soul ſhould give it the Treatment of a Maſter, not the imperious and arbittary uſage of a Tyrant; it muſt cheriſh, but not cram it; and ſhew, that if it does not live for the Body, yet it cannot live here without the Body. One great part of the Artificers Excellence, is to be expert and dextrous in uſing the Tools that belong to his Trade: And it is no leſs Advantage, that a Wiſe Man finds in knowing how his Body ought to be uſed, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as an Inſtrument excellently fitted for the Exerciſe and Promotion of Virtue. Now the way to preſerve the Body in a good Condition, and of keeping it ſit for Service, is by moderate Dier, and regular Exerciſe. What Share the Mind ought to have in the Pleaſures and Gratifications of Senſe, and how far it is allow'd to bear the Body Company in them; hath been already ſhew'd in part, and will be explain'd more largely and particularly hereafter, when we come to treat of the Virtue of Temperance.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The laſt Branch of this Conſideration concerns the Goods or Eſtate; and for the adjuſting exactly what are the Duties of each particular Perſon in this reſpect, we ſhall do well to obſerve, that there are ſeveral Offices and Arts relating to this Matter. There is the Gathering or Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part, the Keeping or Saving, the Managing, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, the Trafficking, and Turning the Penny. For theſe are in a manner ſo many diſtinct Sciences; A Man may be very knowing, and a perfect Maſter in one, and yet alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nether ignorant and unexperienc'd in the reſt of them. The Getting part ſeems to be more difficult and intricate, and to conſiſt of more ſeveral parts than any of the others. The Expending part is that which brings moſt Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The Saving and Managing part is the proper Province of the Miſtreſs of a Family; and This is but a dull Buſineſs, obſcure and mean in common Eſteem, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:53648:548"/>the Methods and the Fruits of it are not ſo viſible as the reſt; but yet ſo neceſſary, that This is the Defence and Security of all, and, ordinarily ſpeaking, our other Cares are to very little purpoſe without it.</p>
                           <p>There are Two Extremes in this Caſe, both equally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and blameable; The one is the Fondneſs and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love of Riches; the other Hating and Refuſing them. By Riches at preſent I underſtand all that Wealth, which is the Overplus of what Neceſſity and a Competency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Quality require to be ſupply'd with. Now a Wiſe Man will run into neither of theſe; but proportions his Deſires according to that Prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prov. xxx.</note> 
                              <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches; feed me with Food convenient for me.</hi> He will do them Juſtice, and allow them their proper place in his Eſteem, looking upon them as they really are, a Thing indifferent in its own Nature; the Occaſion and Ground of either Good or Evil, according as they fall into Good or Ill Hands; but capable of being made uſe of to many excellent Purpoſes: And this is all the Value they can fairly challenge from us.</p>
                           <p>The Miſeries and Miſchiefs which attend the immoderate Love of Riches,<note place="margin">Book I. Chap. 23.</note> and the peeviſh and humourſom Hatred of them, have been ſpoken to in the former parts of this Treatiſe. And therefore all I have now left me to do is, to lay down that Golden Rule, which conſiſts in the Mean between theſe two Extremes; and that I think will be done in theſe Five Particulars.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> It conſiſts in preferring and being pleas'd with them, but not ſetting our Affections upon them. Thus the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher deſcribes his Wiſe Man,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sapiens non amat divitias, ſed mavult.</note> 
                              <hi>One that is not fond of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but yet had rather have them than not.</hi> A Man may be ſenſible of the Convenience of a Thing, and know how to value it as it deſerves, without placing his Heart, and his Happineſs in it. Thus, for Inſtance, a Perſon of low Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and weak Limbs, would be glad and well pleas'd to be taller and better built; and yet it never breaks his Reſt, nor makes him reflect upon himſelf as miſerable, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. He that ſeeks what Nature deſires, without Paſſion and Uneaſineſs, puts himſelf out of the Power of Fortune; and he that is content with what Fortune cannot take away from him, is the Man agreeable to this firſt part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                           <pb n="500" facs="tcp:53648:549"/>
                           <p> But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Paſſion and Anxiety be a Fault even in thoſe who ſeek to enrich themſelves by fair and honeſt Means only, much leſs can we be allow'd to endeavour our own Profit by the Loſs and Detriment of others. For this is to feed and grow fat at their Expence. No nor yet may we purſue Riches by baſe, and pitiful and ſordid Arts; but ſhould take care that all our Increaſe be ſo honourable and becoming, that no Man ſhall have any Temptation but his own Wickedneſs and Ill-nature, to complain of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, or grudge us our good Fortune, or once to ſay, That it is pity ſuch Bleſſings ſhould be beſtowed upon us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the good Providence of God puts theſe Opportunities and Advantages into our Hands, and Wealth comes in upon us in an honeſt and creditable Way, we are not to reject and diſdain it; but receive it with Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Satisfaction, and let it in, but not let it in too far. Riches ſhould be admitted into our Houſes, but not into our Hearts; we may take them into our Poſſeſſion, but not into our Affections. For this is going too deep, and doing them an Honour much greater than they can ever deſerve.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When we have them, we ſhould employ them honourably, virtuouſly, diſcreetly; and convert them into Inſtruments of doing good Offices, and being obliging to others. That the manner of their Going out may be at leaſt as innocent, and as creditable, as that of their Coming in.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whenever they take their Flight, and forſake us, we are not to be dejected, nor melancholy at the Loſs; but thould conſider, that tho' they took themſelves away, they did not deprive us of any thing which was properly and truly our own. And therefore,<note n="*" place="bottom">Si Divitiae effluxerint, non auferent niſi ſemetipfas.</note> 
                              <hi>if they give us the ſlip, there is no Robbery or Wrong in the Caſe;</hi> for we had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſeaſible Right in them before. In one Word, That Man ill deſerves the Love and Favour of God, and ought to quit all his Pretenſions to Virtue, and Philoſophy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who cannot ſupport himſelf with theſe Comforts, but allows the Enjoyments of this World, the principal Place in his Eſteem.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> LOVE is a Pure, a Holy, and a Generous Fire, <note place="margin">What it is.</note> kindled in our Breaſts by Nature; Its Primitive and Original Warmths were firſt diſcern'd in the mutual Affection of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, Parents and Children, Brothers and Siſters: But then, cooling by degrees as it dilated it ſelf, Art and Human Invention found means to blow it up again, and ſupply freſh Fewel, by the Inſtitution of Alliances, Societies, Fraternities, Colleges, and other Incorporations by which the parts of Mankind are cemented and united. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:53648:550"/>that Theſe Artificial Flames underwent the ſame Fate with thoſe Natural; and burnt more feeble and dim, as they were expanded and ſubdivided; as alſo, that their Heat is much allay'd, by the Mixture of Profit, Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Delight, and ſuch other Selfiſh Conſiderations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cheriſh and recruit this Fire again, Choice hath contriv'd to unite its ſcatter'd Forces, and contract them into the narroweſt compaſs that can be, by the ferventeſt and tendereſt of all Affections, that between true Friends. And This indeed is Love in Perfection; as much more ardent, and endearing, and refin'd than any other, as the Vital Heat in the Heart is more intenſe than than of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or the Blood in the Veins.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Love is the very Life and Soul of the World; more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to its Subſiſtence and Well-being (ſay the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) than thoſe two Servants which we cannot want, Fire and Water. The <hi>Latins</hi> therefore have given a good Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of This, in terming Friendſhip <hi>Neceſſitudo,</hi> and Friends <hi>Neceſſarii:</hi> This is the Sun, the Staff, the Salt of Life; all is dark and comfortleſs without the Light of this cheering Fire; all ſeeble and tottering without this firm Support; all flat and inſipid, till this Seaſons and gives it a grateful Reliſh.<note place="margin">Eccluſ. vi. 14, 16.</note> To this purpoſe that Wiſe Man, * <hi>A Faithful Friend is a ſtrong Defence, the Medicine of Liſe; and He that findeth him, ſindeth a great Treaſure.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nor may we ſuppoſe this Virtue ſerviceable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to private Perſons only; <note place="margin">Its Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> or that the Pleaſures and Charms of it are confin'd to ſmall Numbers, and ſecret Retirements; Its Joys and its Beauties are equally, nay more raviſhing and delightful, more uſeful and ſeaſonable to larger Bodies, and publick Communities of Men. For This is the true Mother, the Bearer and Breeder up of Human Society; and all States and Politick Conſtitutions are maintain'd and preſerv'd by virtue of her Influence. None but Tyrants and Monſters are jealous of, or have a diſlike to it; not but that even They adore this Virtue in their Hearts, and have a ſecret Eſteem for it; but becauſe they themſelves cannot come within the Verge and Benefit of it, therefore they bid it open Defiance. Love is powerful enough of it ſelf to keep the World in order, without the Addition of any other Helps: And were it ſuffer'd to have free Courſe, and operate every where with its utmoſt Vigour, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of all Laws would be quite ſuperſeded. For Laws were only a Reſuge taken in to help at a dead Liſt, and
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:53648:550"/>as the beſt Remedy that cou'd then be found, to ſupply the Defect and Decays of Love; and the very End and Aim of theſe is to bring Men by Authority and Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to do That almoſt whether they will or no, which they ought to have done freely and out of Inclination, upon a Principle of Kindneſs. But ſtill Laws fall far ſhort of This in Point of Efficacy and Extent: For Theſe can only take cognizance of Overt-Acts, and pretend not to reſtrain or make Proviſion againſt any other: Whereas Love goes to the Bottom, regulates the Heart as well as the Tongue and the Hands; purifies the Will and directs its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; thus ſweetning the very Spring, whence all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow. Upon this Account <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to have ſaid, That Wiſe and Good Lawgivers have a greater regard to Love, than to Juſtice. And becauſe in this wretched De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of Mankind, both the One and the Other of theſe are but too often ſlighted and defeated, therefore a Third Remedy hath been thought of, but That ſtill leſs effectual in its Operations, and leſs valuable in it ſelf, than either of the Former; which is Force of Arms; than which nothing can be more directly contrary to that firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Love. And thus you have a ſhort Scheme laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you of Politick Inſtitutions and Government; and by what Steps they grew, or rather indeed fell and ſunk down into that Condition we now ſee them in. But ſtill the firſt and ſingle Principle of Amity is worth All, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably above all the reſt; as indeed it uſually happens in other Caſes, that the Second and Subſidiary Remedies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come up to the Firſt and Principal; for Theſe are the Effects of Choice, and taken for their own Sakes; but Thoſe the laſt Shifts of neceſſitated Men, who in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity lay hold on any thing that comes next, and muſt be content to take what they can get.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There is, it muſt be confeſt, <note place="margin">Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd as to Caulis</note> great Ambiguity in this Term of Love, and many Diſtinctions have accordingly been made, which were but needful to give Us a true Idea of the Variety of Paſſions proceeding from it. The Ancients were wont to divide it into Four ſorts, Natural, Social, Hoſpitable, and Venereal. But this Diviſion ſo far as I can apprehend, does not do the Buſineſs; and therefore we will try another Method, and diſtinguiſh it theſe Three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ways.</p>
                              <pb n="504" facs="tcp:53648:551"/>
                              <p> Firſt with regard to the Cauſes that create it; and They are Four. Nature, Virtue, Profit, and Pleaſure; and theſe ſometimes advance all together in a Body; ſometimes Two or Three of them; and very often One of them appears ſingle. But of all theſe, Virtue is the nobleſt Cauſe, and the moſt powerful; for This is pure and refin'd, and hath it's Reſidence in the Heart, the Seat of Love it ſelf. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture runs in the Blood, Profit lies in the Purſe, and Pleaſure is conſin'd to ſome particular Part, and works but upon the Senſes of the Body, except at a diſtance, and by Reflection only. Accordingly Virtue is more free, and open, and pure, and firm in its Affection; for all the other Cauſes, when deſtitute of this, are ſordid and mean, fickle, and of ſhort Continuance. He that loves upon the Account of Virtue, can never be weary, becauſe there are always freſh Charms to attract and entertain him; and if ſuch a Friendſhip hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to break off, he hath no reaſon to complain, becauſe the Breach could not have been, if all that was worth his Love had not fail'd. He that Loves for Profit, if a Breach happen there, is full of immoderate Complaints; but expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to very juſt Reproach, for having ſpared no Pains, and yet gaining nothing by all his Trouble. He that Loves for Pleaſure, when the Satisfaction ceaſes, the Paſſion ceaſes too; and he takes leave of the Object, without murmuring or complaint.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Second Diſtinction relates to the Parties concern'd in this Affection; <note place="margin">The Perſons.</note> and of Theſe there are Three ſorts remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. One proceeds in a direct Line between Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oural, as between Parents and Children, Uncles and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews; or Legal and Political, as between a Prince and his Subjects, a Lord and his Vaſſals, a Maſter and his Servants, a Turor and his Pupil; a Prelate, or Preacher, or Magiſtrate, and the People under his Care. Now, if one would ſpeak properly, and go to the Nicety of the thing, This is not true Love; by reaſon of the Diſtance and great Diſparity between the Circumſtances of the Parties, which hinders that Eaſineſs and Privacy, that Familiarity and entire Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which is the Principal Fruit and Conſequence of Love; as alſo, upon the Account of that Obligation there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>es upon them, which leaves ſuch Perſons very little at their own Diſpoſal in this Matter, and ſo takes off from that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuppoſed in this Virtue, making the Affection rather an Effect of Duty and Neceſſity, than of Choice. And in
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:53648:551"/>conſideration of This it is, that we call it by other Names more ſuitable to thoſe Engagements. Thus Inferiours, we ſay, owe Honour, and Reſpect, and Obedience to thoſe above them; and Superiours owe Care, and Protection, and Vigilance, and kind Condeſcenſion to thoſe beneath them.</p>
                              <p>The Second ſort of Love, with regard to the Parties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in a Collateral Line; and This is between ſuch as are either almoſt or altogether Equals. This again is Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either Natural, or Voluntary. The Natural firſt, as between Brothers, Siſters, Couſins, and the like; which is more properly call'd Love than the Former, becauſe there is leſs Diſparity in their Condition, and ſo more room for Familiarity and free Converſe; But then here is an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from Nature too, and that ſuch a one as looſens or ſlackens that Knot in one reſpect, which it ties and binds us by in another. For many Quarrels and Miſunderſtandings commonly ariſe between theſe Relations, upon the Account of Portion, Inheritance, and that variety of Buſineſs and Intereſts, wherein they are mutually concern'd. Beſides, that very frequently there wants that Similitude and exact Agreement of Humours and Inclinations, which is the very Life and Eſſence of true and entire Affection. <hi>I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, he is an ill Man, or a Fool, but he is my Brother, or my Relation,</hi> are Complaints exceeding common in the Mouths of ſuch Perſons: But then there is likewiſe a free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Love between Equals, ſuch as that of intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and Friends; which hath no other Band of Union but Affection only; and This is what in the ſtrict and proper Signification of the Word, we call <hi>Amity</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Third ſort, with reſpect to the Perſons concern'd, is a Mixture and Compund of the two Former; from whence it follows, that each Ingredient having its due Force, this Compoſition ought to be much ſtronger than either of the other can poſſibly be alone. And ſuch is the Conjugal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection between Husband and Wife. This hath ſomewhat of the direct and deſcending Line, by reaſon of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the Husband, and the Subjection of the Wife; and it hath a great deal of the Collateral Line too, upon the account that This is a Society inſtituted for Familiarity and mutual Comfort. An Intimation whereof Almighty God himſelf ſeems to have given us, in the firſt Creation of Woman, by taking her out of the Subſtance of Man, yet
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:53648:552"/>not out of his Head, nor his Feet, but his Side. And thus married Perſons do, and are oblig'd to exerciſe theſe two ſorts of Affection in their Behaviour to each other; but each of them ſo, as may be moſt ſeaſonable and becoming. In Publick, the Duties of the direct Line take place; for a Wiſe Woman will always be ſure to treat her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Company with Submiſſion and Reſpect; but in private and alone, the Familiarities of the Collateral Line, and all imaginable Freedoms are to be practis'd. This Conjugal Affection is likewiſe twofold; and of a compounded Nature in another Reſpect. For it is both Spiritual and Corporeal; an Union of Bodies as well as Souls; which is a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion peculiar to This alone, and ſuch as no other kind of Love can pretend to, except That which is abuſively and moſt injuriouſly ſtyl'd ſo, and ſuch as not only all wholſom Laws, but even Reaſon and Nature it ſelf have always diſallow'd and condemn'd. Upon theſe ſeveral Accounts then this Affection of a marry'd State is fitted to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and ſtrong, powerful and endearing. But yet there are two or three Rubs in the way, that check and cool it, and very ſeldom ſuffer it to riſe up to all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a juſt Friendſhip. One is, That no part here is left to their own Liberty, but the firſt Entrance upon it. When once they are in, they muſt even make their beſt on't, for there is no getting out again. The perſiſting and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in this Soceity is irreverſibly bound upon them; and this Conſtraint is the univerſal Condition of all the beſt and moſt Religious, that is of all Chriſtian Marriages; For in other Perſuaſions Men are left more to their Liberty, by the allowing Divorces, ſinal Separations, and Nullities of this Obligation. Another (if the Ladies will give us leave to ſay ſo) is the Weakneſs of the Sex; whoſe Strength of Mind is not ſufficient to keep up, and hold pace in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conference, and unreſerv'd Communication of all a Man's Thoughts; and the Contemplations of a penetrating and judicious Mind. So that here is quite another Turn of Soul; it wants Subſtance and Solidity to keep the Knot right; and this Conjunction is like the faſtening of one thing which is ſtubborn and inflexible, to another that is ſlender, and limber, and yielding; which for want of Strength to bear up againſt it, buckles under, and ſlips away from it. A Third Impediment to that entire Affection in a Conjugal State, may be imputed to the great Intricacy of Buſineſs that attends it; the Children, the Relations on both ſides;
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:53648:552"/>and a great many other Uneaſineſſes and Perplexities, which, tho' but an Accidental Inconvenience, and not conſtant and unavoidable, as the two former are, yet is frequent and conſiderable enough to deſerve a Remark here, and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſturbs the Happineſs and Quiet, and cools the vigour of that Affection, which is the Bleſſing and Ornament of that State.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Third Diſtinction of Love concerns the Strength and Intenſeneſs, or the Weakneſs and Remiſſneſs of it.<note place="margin">Degrees.</note> With regard to This Conſideration it is again Twofold. One Common and Imperfect, which indeed ought rather to be term'd Benevolence or Well-wiſhing, Familiarity, Particular Acquaintance: And this varies exceedingly, and may differ almoſt infinitely in the degrees of it, each of which may be more or leſs cloſe, and intimate, and ſtrong than other: The Other is Perfect; and this is a ſort of <hi>Phoenix,</hi> few, if any one Inſtance of it to be ſeen in the World; ſo far from being practiſed by Mankind, that they can ſcarce form a tolerable Idea of it to themſelves; or reach up to the Force and Excellencies of the thing, by all the Strength of mere Imagination.</p>
                              <p>For the clearer and more diſtinct Underſtanding of this Difference, it may be of ſome Service to us to give a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of each, and to confront them with one another; as for Example:
<list>
                                    <item>1. The Common may be conciliated, and come to its utmoſt Pitch in a very little while; but long Time, and great Deliberation muſt go to the Finiſhing a perfect Amity. Such Perſons, according to the Proverb, muſt eat at leaſt a Buſhel of Salt together, before they can be qualify'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an entire Friendſhip.</item>
                                    <item>2. That which is Common may be contracted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on by an infinite variety of Accidents, which contribute to our Profit and Delight; whereupon a Wiſe Man preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed theſe two Rules for the attaining to it; That a Man ſhould be entertaining in his Diſcourſe, and obliging and ſerviceable in his Actions; for if the One of theſe do but furniſh out Pleaſure, and the other promote the Intereſt of the Perſons with whom we converſe, all that a Common Friendſhip pretends to, is done effectually: But now, That which I call a Perfect Friendſhip is never built upon ſuch mean Conſiderations. Nothing leſs than the Contemplation and mutual Experience of an unfeign'd and vigorous Virtue can be Foundation ſtrong enough for ſo noble a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure.</item>
                                    <pb n="508" facs="tcp:53648:553"/>
                                    <item> 3. The Common Friendſhips may extend themſelves to a great Number of Perſons: But the true entire Friendſhip admits but of One Partner; and this is to all Intents and Purpoſes a Second Self: ſo that altho' the Perſons are Two, yet their Hearts and Affections are One and the Same. And the neceſſity of confining ſuch Friendſhips to Two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is very evident from the Nature of the thing. For to ſuppoſe more, deſtroys the Notion, and obſtructs all the Offices and Operations of it. For inſtance, To ſuccour and aſſiſt a Friend in his Diſtreſs, is an indiſpenſable Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if we put the Caſe of Two ſuch ſtanding in need of our Help at the ſame time; and not only ſo, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Kindneſſes which are inconſiſtent and contrary to one another, Which way ſhall I turn my ſelf; or how can I diſcharge my Obligations, when one of theſe is favour'd and relieved to the Prejudice and Neglect of the other? Again, My Friend imparts a Secret to me, What Diſtraction is here? If I reveal it, This is a Breach of Truſt and Friendſhip, which obliges me to be Faithful in keeping what is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſted with me: But then, if I do not communicate it to my other Friend, this is Unfaithfulneſs too; for it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law of true and entire Friendſhip, to unboſom themſelves freely, and to have no Reſerves from each other. Thus you ſee the Confuſion and Perplexity, the Impracticableneſs and utter Impoſſibility indeed of more Friends than One, in the higheſt and moſt genuine Acceptation of the Word. And, no doubt, Multiplication of Parts, and Diviſion, is, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, an Enemy to Perfection, as Union is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and inſeparable Property of it.</item>
                                    <item>4. The Common Friendſhip admits of Diminution, and Increaſe; it is ſubject to Exceptions, Limitations, different Modifications and Forms; it grows warmer and colder; and comes and goes by Fits, like an intermitting Fever; according as the Perſon is Abſent or Preſent; as his Merits are more or leſs; and the Kindneſſes he does more or leſs frequent and engaging; and many other Conſiderations there are, capable of making an Alteration in our Affections of this kind. But now, That Friendſhip, which is perfect and entire, is much otherwiſe; firm and conſtant to it ſelf, even and ſteady: Its Warmths are healthful, its Temper regular, and all its Motions vigorous and uniform.</item>
                                    <item>5. The Common Friendſhip admits and ſtands in need of ſeveral Rules for its Direction; ſeveral Wiſe Cautions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd by conſiderate Perſons for the regulating and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:53648:553"/>it, and preventing any future Inconveniences, which may happen to ariſe from Unwarineſs, and an unguarded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. One of theſe is, To love our Friend ſo far as may be conſiſtent with the Preſervation of our Piety, and Truth, and Virtue. For even that old Expreſſion of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus uſque ad Aras,</hi> implies this Reſtriction. Another is to love him ſo, as if you were ſure one Day to hate him; and to hate a Man ſo, as if you were hereafter to love him; that is, To be prudent and reſerv'd in your Paſſions and Affections, and not abandon one's ſelf ſo entirely, or be ſo violent in either Extreme, that a Man ſhould have juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to repent, and condemn his former Behaviour, if, at any time hereafter there ſhould happen to be a Breach, or any Coldneſs grow betwixt them. A Third is, To come into our Friend's Aſſiſtance of our own accord, and without being call'd. For it puts a Friend out of Countenance to demand his Right; and he buys a Kindneſs dear, when forc'd to ask what he looks upon as his juſt Due, and that which he conceives he ought to be prevented in. Therefore theſe Obligations are never fully ſatisfy'd, except we be always ready and early in our Courteſies, and, if that be poſſible, beforehand with his very Wiſhes. A Fourth is not to be troubleſome to our Friends, by entertaining them with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Stories of our own Misfortunes, and being always in the complaining Strain. Like Women, that make it their whole Buſineſs to move Pity, and are conſtantly magnifying their own Hardſhips and Sufferings. Now all theſe are very uſeful and ſeaſonable Directions, fit to be obſerv'd in common Friendſhips: But in That more ſublime and perfect one, there is no occaſion at all for theſe; This diſdains all Forms, and is above the Pedantick Niceties of Ceremony and Reſerve.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> This is what we ſhall attain to a more juſt and diſtinct Notion of, <note place="margin">Perfect Friendſhip, what.</note> by giving the Reader a Draught and Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Friendſhip in Perfection: Which is no other, in ſhort, than a free, full, and entire Mingling of Souls through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and in every part and point. To explain this now in Three Particulars. I ſay Firſt, It muſt be a Mingling and (if I may ſo expreſs it) an Incorporating, and not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Souls only. For this gives us a Reſemblance of Solid Bodies, which, how ſtrongly and artificially ſoever they may be tack'd together in one part, yet do not touch in all; And not only ſo, but that very Ligament which joins them together, may be diſſolv'd, or cut aſunder, and each of theſe Bodies may ſubſiſt, and remain, and feel it ſelf entire, after
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:53648:554"/>Separation. But now in theſe perfect Friendſhips, the Souls of Men are entirely abſorpt in each other; ſo confounded, as never to be diſtinguiſh'd, never to be parted again; like Liquors well mix'd, which can never be drawn off from each other. And That is the perfect, the univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Minds, that entire Agreement of Judgments and Inclinations, which I rather choſe to expreſs by mingling of Souls, as a Phraſe that gives us a ſtronger Idea of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than any Reſemblance taken from Solids could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do. Secondly, It is free, and purely the Work of Choice, a generous and ſpontaneous Act of the Will, without any Obligation, or diſtant Inducement, foreign to the Worth and Agreeableneſs of the Parties. For nothing is more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary than Love; and ſo much of Conſtraint as you put upon it, ſo much you weaken the Affection, and take off from the true Nature and Commendation of the Virtue. Thirdly, It is univerſal, and without Exception; no Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any thing, nothing that can be call'd ours in bar to our Friend's Title and Pretenſions. Eſtate, Honours, Preferments, Judgments, Thoughts, Wills, all laid open and in common; nay, even Life it ſelf is what both have equal Right in. From This ſo univerſal and entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication it is, that that thoſe Maxims have taken place, of <hi>Friendſhip finding or making all equal;</hi> of <hi>Friends having no Property;</hi> and the like; ſuch can no longer lend or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; they cannot give or receive; there is no ſuch thing as Beneficence and Obligation, Acknowledgments or Returns, or any ſuch Offices of Kindneſs or Gratitude practicable or in force for Their Condition. Theſe indeed are the Arts and Methods by which ordinary Friendſhips are cheriſh'd and maintain'd; but at the ſame time that they are Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Affection, they are Marks of Diſtinction too. Whereas, in this Caſe, it is as with one's own Self; and as a Man cannot be oblig'd to himſelf for any Service done to his own Perſon, nor owe any Gratitude upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Kindneſs and Readineſs to relieve his own Wants, which he feels in his Breaſt, no more can one true Friend be indebted to another upon any the like Occaſions. Nay, even Marriage, tho' it give us the beſt, yet is even That but a diſtant and feeble Reſemblance of the Divine Union we are now treating of. The Laws allow no ſuch thing as Diſtinct Properties, and Donations betwixt Man and Wife. And therefore in Friendſhip could there be any ſuch thing as giving and receiving, the Benefactor would be
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:53648:554"/>That Perſon who made uſe of his Friend's Kindneſs, and ſo put it in his Power to do what became him. For the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deſign, and eagereſt Wiſh of each Party, being to ſnatch every occaſion of mutual Aſſiſtance and Benefit; He who ſurniſhes the Opportunity, and gratifies this Deſire, is properly the Donor. Since it is to his Bounty that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ows his greateſt Happineſs; for ſuch is the Satisfaction of compaſſing his Deſires, and effecting that which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more pleaſant and dear to him, than all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Enjoyments in the World beſides.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Some few Inſtances there are of this entire Friendſhip, <note place="margin">Examples of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> and unreſerv'd Communication of Souls in ancient Story. When <hi>Bloſius</hi> was apprehended, upon the Account of a mighty Friendſhip known to be between Him and <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> who was already under Sentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Seditious Practices; upon Examination what he would have done for his ſake, he reply'd, That he would have ſtuck at nothing to do him Service. The Judges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further, and asked, Whether if <hi>Gracchus</hi> had defir'd him to ſet the Temples on Fire, he would have comply'd with ſo Sacrilegious a Requeſt: He anſwer'd again, That <hi>Gracchus</hi> was not capable of deſiring ſo wicked a Proof of his Friendſhip; but upon ſuppoſition that he could, he ſhould not have refuſed it. Now This was a very bold and a dangerous Anſwer. The firſt part of it indeed, that <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> could not entertain a Thought ſo impious, was no more than he might well enough venture to ſay; becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Account we have already given of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, every Friend in perfection is not only fully acquainted with the Diſpoſition, and all the Thoughts of his Friend, which ſufficiently qualifies him to be reſponſible for them all; but he is abſolute Maſter of them, and ſo can diſpoſe of them, as much as of his own. But that laſt Clauſe of doing ſo if <hi>Gracchus</hi> had requir'd it, was idle and impertinent; for it does not in any Degree take off from what he had affirm'd before, concerning his Aſſurance of <hi>Gracchus</hi> not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any ſuch Deſire, nor make the thing one Whit better or worſe. Now this Inſtance ſhews us the perfect Harmony of Souls, with regard to the concurring Judgments and Inclinations of ſuch Friends.</p>
                              <p>The Second Inſtance relates to their Fortunes. To which purpoſe we read of Three Friends, (This Number of Three I confeſs is a Contradiction to the Rules here propoſed, and tempts us to think that this Friendſhip, tho' very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:53648:555"/>had not yet attained to all the Degrees of juſt a Perfection) But Three however there were: Two of them in very plentiful, the other in as low Circumſtances, who had a poor old Mother, and a young unmarry'd Daughter, both lying upon his Hands. This Perſon upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed makes a Will, and bequeaths to One of his Friends his poor feeble Mother to maintain; to the Other his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a Charge to ſee her as well match'd as poſſibly he could; and in caſe either of theſe happen'd to fail, the whole Care of both was to devolve upon the Other. A notable Legacy you'll ſay; and ſo the World then thought it; for every Body made themſelves extremely merry with ſo odd a Bequeſt. But, while the World ridicul'd this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual piece of Executorſhip, the Heirs themſelves took the Adminiſtration upon them with wonderful Satisfaction; and each was greedy to get his Legacy into his poſſeſſion. Within a very few Days after, the Legatee to whoſe ſhare the Mother fell, happen'd to die too; and then the ſurviving Coheir, ſucceeding into the whole Concern, took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good Care of the Mother; and, aſſoon as conveniently he could, enquired out convenient Matches for both, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd his own only Daughter, and that of his deceas'd Friend, upon one and the ſame Day, and divided his whole Eſtate equally between them. Now, according to this Caſe thus ſtated, as you ſee, it hath been the conſtant Opinion of the Wiſeſt Men, that He who dy'd firſt, gave greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his Friendſhip, and was a more bountiful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, than either of the Survivors; that he really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd them the moſt valuable Inheritance, by putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hands ſuch occaſions of doing good; and allowing them the Satisfaction of laying themſelves out in his Service, as became their Character, and the Neceſſities of his own Family requir'd.</p>
                              <p>The Third Example goes higher ſtill, and reaches to Life it ſelf. And here we may reflect upon that well-known Story of two Friends. That a Tyrant had condemn'd one of them to die, and had appointed the Day and Hour of his Execution; but he with great Importunity obtain'd Leave to go and take Care of his Affairs and Family, upon this Condition, that he ſhould give Security, and find one to be bound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for Body, for his ſurrendring himſelf again at the Time prefix'd; and in caſe he fail'd, then his Bail to undergo the ſame Capital Puniſhment, which had been awarded to his
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53648:555"/>Principal. The Condition was readily accepted, and the Priſoner produces his Friend to be bound for him, who accordingly was impriſon'd in the other's ſtead. The Day of Execution came, and this Bondſman prepar'd himſelf to die with all imaginable Cheerfulneſs. But, as he was going about it, the Condemn'd Perſon came in, releas'd his Security, and offer'd himſelf to the fatal Stroke. This ſtrange Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity made ſuch Impreſſion upon the Tyrant, that, much out of Countenance, and full of Aſtoniſhment, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd into Mercy; ſet them both at Liberty, and made it his Requeſt, that theſe brave Men would accept of the Proffers he made of his Kindneſs and Affection, and do him the Honour to admit him into their Number, and reckon that they had now a Third ſincere and generous Friend.</p>

Now, in order to the clearing all the Difficulties that may ariſe upon this Occaſion, I ſhall endeavour to ſet this whole Matter in its true Light, and direct Men how to behave themſelves. And the whole, I think, of what needs to be ſaid, may conveniently enough be reduc'd to Four Conſiderations. The Perſon that engages his Faith; the Party to whom that Engagement is made; the Subject-Matter, or the Thing covenanted for; and the Manner or Form of entring into that Engagement.</p>
                              <pb n="515" facs="tcp:53648:556"/>
                              <p>

                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> As as to the Perſon engaging his Faith, it is one neceſſary Qualification to the rendring that Promiſe valid and legal, that he have Power to promiſe, and to make it Good; If he be under the Direction, and at the Diſpoſal of an other, he is in no Condition to engage at all; nor is there any Force in ſuch a Covenant, till it be ratified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Perſon, under whoſe Authority the Promiſer is. Thus God himſelf hath determined and ſtated the Matter at large, under the Levitical Law;<note place="margin">Num. ch. xxx.</note> where the Vows of Wives, and Children, and others in a State of Pupillage and Subjection, are declared of none Effect, till known and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by their Husbands, or Parents, or Guardians. And the Reaſon of this is plain, becauſe Nature and Duty have veſted theſe Perſons with an Original and Antecedent Right in thoſe under their Care, which no After-act of ſuch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Their Conſent, can convey away, or diſannul: They have nothing to give, and therefore they promiſe what is none of their own. Thus in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, the Tribune <hi>Saturninus,</hi> and his Accomplices are eſteemed to have been juſtly put to Death, notwithſtanding they quitted the Capitol, (which they had rebelliouſly invaded, and poſſeſt themſelves of,) upon the Conſuls Word of Honour. For theſe very Conſuls were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Common-wealth and Miniſters of Publick Juſtice only; and therefore they had no Right to promiſe Indemnity, for Crimes againſt the State and People of <hi>Rome</hi> in general But, when a Man is entirely at his own Diſpoſal, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for ſuch Things as he hath an indiſputable Right to make Good, he is obliged to keep his Word punctually, let him be otherwiſe never ſo Great, never ſo Abſolute. The rather indeed upon theſe Conſiderations; becauſe the more Abſolute he is, the more Free he is to Promiſe, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Able to Perform. And therefore that common Maxim is a very Juſt and True One, <hi>That the bare Word of a Prince, ought to be as Sacred and Obligatory, as the ſolemneſt Oath of a Private Man.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As to the Perſon, to whom the Engagement is made, This is a Conſideration, which makes but little Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Caſe; for let him be Who or What he will, it ought to be diſcharged. There are but Two Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are ſufficient to diſſolve this Obligation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judgment of Thoſe who have diſcuſs'd this Point. The One is, if he did not accept of this Engagement, ſo as to reſt ſatisfied in, or place his Dependence upon it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome other Security, and reſted his Faith upon That: For, as the Giving of Faith ought to be look'd upon as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:53648:557"/>ſo ſhould the Receiving it be too; and Diſtruſt in the one Party is no leſs a Diſparagement to it, than Fallacy and Trick in the other. If it be not relied upon for the Sake of its own binding Force, the Confidence is loſt and broke; and it ceaſes to be mutual Faith any longer. The demanding of Hoſtages, and keeping Men under Guard, and ſo entring into Caution, and requiring Pledges of any ſort, is not truſting to Men's Truth, but to their Security; and it is Ridiculous and Senſeleſs, to call This truſting to Men's Honeſty. He that is confined, either by a Keeper, or a Priſon, hath been falſe to no Engagement, if he make his Eſcape; nor can he be ſaid to have deceived thoſe, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repos'd any Confidence in him. Had ſuch an one been left at large upon his Parole, or had he prevail'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſtand bound for his Appearance; Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would have obliged him to ſuffer any Inconvenience rather than falſify his Word, or give up his Bail, or any manner of way diſappoint the Expectations, and betray the Truſt of thoſe who depended upon him. And therefore the Reaſon of that <hi>Roman</hi> ſeems to carry a great deal of Force,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vult ſibi quiſ<expan>

But whatever is indented for by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:53648:557"/>Agreement afterwards, cancels all the Advantage, that might otherwiſe have been taken of his former Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and makes it Unreaſonable to revenge and reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate it. Theſe Two Caſes are generally look'd upon, as Reſervations from the general Rule of being punctual to one's Word; and we ſhall do well to give even theſe a Careful Cenſideration, for perhaps there are ſome Junctures and Occaſions, in which They may not be able to bear us out; or at beſt, if it be our Priviledge to regulate our ſelves by them, it is not our Duty to do ſo; and a Man may ſometimes ſee good Cauſe, rather to ſubmit to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and forego the Uſe of his Liberty, than to ſtretch it to the utmoſt Point, and do All, that in Point of Rigour he might well enough juſtifie himſelf in. But however; allowing the moſt that can be made of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the Promiſe does not fall within the Compaſs of theſe Two Caſes, no Conſideration relating to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for whoſe Aſſurance it was made, can excuſe us from looking upon it as Sacred and Indiſpenſable.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The laſt Particular relates to the Manner or Formalities made uſe of in the Act of engaging; <note place="margin">The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing.</note> for, as all the Ways of binding our Conſciences are not equally Solemn, ſo neither are all equally Obligatory; and therefore ſeveral Doubts and Controverſies have been ſtarted upon this Point. Several Perſons are of Opinion, that a Promiſe extorted by Force, and Fear, or obtained Fraudulently and by Surpriſe, does leave no Tye upon the Conſcience: Becauſe, in both theſe Caſes, the Will hath not it's free Courſe; nor can the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment act with that impartiality and clearneſs, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the making a juſt Determination: Others again tell you quite otherwiſe; that the Will is not capable of being conſtrain'd; and though the Choice be not abſolutely voluntary and free, yet there is Choice enough left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Obligation. Accordingly we find, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was far from thinking himſelf at Liberty; nay, that he was commanded to fulfil the Covenant made with the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:53648:558"/>
                                 <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> though perfectly tricked into it by Surpriſe, and a falſe Repreſentation of their Caſe. The moſt I think that can be ſaid, (if thus much may be ſaid) in Favour of the Former Opinion is, That a bare Promiſe may be diſpenſed with in ſuch Circumſtances; but if that Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were confirm'd by the Solemnity of an Oath, a Man muſt look upon himſelf to be bound by it: Bound, though not in Reſpect of ſtrict Equity, and the Merits of the Cauſe; yet in Reſpect to the Name of the Juſt and Holy God, who was invoked as a Witneſs and a Judge upon that Occaſion. But that a Man in ſuch Caſes may be very well allowed to ſeek any Redreſs or Reparation, which the Laws will give him, and which he hath not poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ty'd up his own Hands from requiring, for ſuch Violence or Deceit. And this Reſolution too ſeems to have ſome Countenance given to it, by the Method <hi>Jeſhua</hi> took, who, when the Fraud was diſcovered, did not treat thoſe <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> as common Friends and Allies, but made them <hi>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water;</hi> and though he ſpared their Lives, revenged their Falſhood, and crafty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, by keeping them under, and employing them in ſervile and laborious Offices. That the Formality of an Oath, and intereſſing Almighty God in our Promiſes adds to the Engagement, and makes it more forcible and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no Doubt can be made; for Breach of Faith is then a double Offence, and Aggravates that Unfaithfulneſs which is bad in its ſelf, with the Addition of wilful Perjury, which is much Worſe. But to think to tye Men up by new and fantaſtical Oaths, as ſome do, is altogether uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; and ſo is the multiplying of common Oaths without ſome urgent and very important Occaſion. For it is certain, that honeſt Men need not be thus dealt with; and thoſe that are not ſo, will be bound by nothing we can deviſe. The beſt and moſt commendable Courſe is to Swear by the Name of the One True Everlaſting God; and to do this with a becoming Reverence, and ſerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; as conſidering, that he is a ſevere Avenger of thoſe who take his Name in vain; that they muſt give Account for all breach of Faith, and Truſt; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he will be very rigorous with thoſe, who by a moſt monſtrous Hardineſs, and deteſtable Impiety, take Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Solemnity of an Oath; and turn the Uſe of his Name into an Opportunity of deceiving the more effectually.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For in Truth, if we conſider the Matter nicely, it will appear that Perfidiouſneſs and Perjury are more execrable Villanies, and higher Affronts to Almighty God, than even bold and avowed Atheiſm it ſelf. The Atheiſt, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes a God, acts more conſiſtently with his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and diſhonours him leſs, in thinking there is no ſuch Being at all; than he who is perſuaded, and acknowledges that there is a God, and yet in deſpight of his own Senſe, and in defiance of the Divine Juſtice, mocks him, by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him to atteſt a Lye, and will not ſtand by what he hath appealed to that All-ſeeing Judge for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of. Now he that ſwears with an Intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, does plainly mock God; and ſhews that he is afraid of Man only, but under no Concern for what God can do in vindication of his injured Honour. And ſure to be miſtaken in one's Notions concerning God, is much more pardonable, than to be rightly informed, and fully convinced, and yet to trample all thoſe Convictions under Foot, and put a ſtudied Affront upon the Deity we confeſs, and pretend to adore. The Horrour and Abſurdity of Falſhood and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, cannot be more fully and ſignificantly expreſt, than by that Character given of it, by One of the Antients, who calls this, The giving a publick Teſtimony of our Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, and ſtanding in Awe of Men. And what can be more Monſtrous, than to ſhew one's ſelf a Coward with regard to poor Mortals, of the ſame Frailties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities with our ſelves, and Hectors with regard to the Irreſiſtible Vengeance and Power of an Omnipotent God? But, beſides the horrible Impiety and Irreligion of ſuch Proceedings, the Falſe and Treacherous Man is a Traitor and Mortal declared Enemy to all Laws, and the very Being of Human Society: For mutual Confidence is the very Link, that holds all this together; and if once that Knot be untwiſted or broken aſunder, the whole Chain falls to pieces immediately. Words are then but Air and empty Noiſe; and yet by theſe it is, that all Commerce can only be maintained; ſo that when Credit can no longer be given with Safety to what People ſay, all Buſineſs is at an end, and no new Method can be found to hold them in.</p>

And This is more troubleſome than Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commonly imagine; eſpecially, when they are ſuch as Great Men have either committed to us, or are concerned
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:53648:559"/>in. Were the Difficulties that attend this Duty rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it would give a mighty Check to curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Tempers. For ſure, that Man acts moſt prudently, who declines this Truſt as much, and knows as little of this kind, as poſſibly he can: For he that thruſts himſelf under theſe Obligations, entangles himſelf in more Snares, and Uneaſineſſes, than he is aware of. For, beſides the conſtant Guard he muſt keep upon his Tongue, that none of theſe Things make their Eſcape, he falls under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity many times of lying or diſowning what he knows, in a manner irreconcilable with Sincerity and a Good Conſcience; or at leaſt of evading it by ſuch mean and little Shifts, as are very grating to a Man of Generoſity and a Great Soul. This therefore of avoiding ſuch Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and Dangerous Knowledge, is the firſt and beſt Advice. But if there be no Remedy, and Men will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock their Breaſts to us, notwithſtanding all the modeſt Pains we are at to be excuſed, the Next Rule is, To be Faithful and Exact in the ſafe Cuſtody of all committed to us under the Seal of Secrecy; and to this Purpoſe to practiſe a prudent Reſerve in all our Converſation; Which is an Art, that every Man cannot be Maſter of; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſomething of a Diſpoſition in Nature, as well as Art and Induſtry afterwards, and the Senſe of that Obligation we are under in theſe Caſes; Attendency to Silence, as well as a Cuſtom of it: For the open and gay Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are always in Danger; and They who affect to Talk much in all Companies, will be ſure very often to ſay a great many Things, which ought to have been ſuppreſt.</p>

So that the Difficulty is double: For very few undertake this ungrateful Office for fear of diſpleaſing; and of thoſe who have Sincerity enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, few have Skill enough to perform it as it ſhould be. Now This is an extremely nice Undertaking; and if ill done, like a Medicine improperly given, tho' never ſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in its own Nature, it puts the Patient to a World of Uneaſineſs, and is ſure to do more hurt than good. The Effect of it is only to harden him the more; and thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53648:560"/>hath the ſame Operation that Flattery would have; only with this Difference, that the One gives Pain and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and the Other Pleaſure and Self-Satisfaction. For, as excellent and noble as Truth is, yet hath it not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of being always ſeaſonable and becoming; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great many favourable Circumſtances to ſoften and recommend it. For, let a Man's Intention and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be never ſo Holy, and the Subſtance of his Advice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo excellent, yet there may be Faults in the applying it; and ſuch as, that it were as well, and perhaps much better let alone.</p>

Which yet are to be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as calculated for ſuch Perſons and Circumſtances, where ſomething of Diſtance, and Ceremony, and a Fear of being offenſive, may be expected. For, in caſe there be any intimate Familiarity, or particular Confidence; any Power or Authority in the Perſon reproving, that may ſet them above ſuch Formalities, then all the neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving theſe following Rules, is quite ſuperſeded.

<list>
                                    <item>1. To have a due regard to Time and Place; for a great deal depends upon the Nicking of theſe Two. For Inſtance, It ſhould not be done at a Publick Entertainment, nor amongſt Perſons met together for Mirth and Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for This is to be very impertinent, and to ſpoil good Company. Nor is it ſeaſonable, when we ſee the Party in ſome more than ordinary Trouble, Melancholy, and out of Humour, or under ſome very ſore Affliction. This looks like an Act of Hoſtility, and barbarous Inſulting; as if we took the Advantage of his Misfortunes, or Dejection of Mind, and only waited for an Opportunity to grieve, and teaze, and quite oppreſs him; when his Condition calls rather for our Comfort, and Encouragement, and Aſſiſtance. It is an Act of great Cruelty to chide Men in Diſtreſs; and <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> was ſo incens'd at this ill Treatment, that he killed two of his particular Friends, for preſuming to make this Addition to his Calamity.</item>
                                    <item>2. It muſt not be done for all Faults indifferently; Not for ſuch as are inconſiderable, and of no very ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for This ſavours of Peeviſhneſs and Ill-nature, and
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:53648:561"/>betrays too much of Eagerneſs and Delight in this, at beſt ungrateful, Office. A Man will be apt to tell himſelf, that ſuch a Man is fond and glad of ſuch Opportunities, and makes uſe of them, more to gratiſie his own Spleen, than with any Deſign of proſiting his Friend. Nor yet ſhould it be done for very groſs, notorious, and dangerous Actions; ſuch as cannot but leave a Sting behind them, and the Enormity whereof he muſt needs be affected with, without our awakening his Conſcience, or taking the trouble of working him up to a Senſe of them. For he will be ſure, upon ſuch Occaſions, to dread the Reproach and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of an Admonition; and will fancy that we lie upon the Catch for his Fall, and labour to put him quite out of Conceit with himſelf.</item>
                                    <item>3. This Admonition and Reproof ought to be private, that there may be no Witneſſes of his Diſgrace; for it is very grievous to be publickly expos'd. We are told of a Young Man, who was ſo overwhelm'd with Shame and Confuſion at a Rebuke given him by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he could not bear to out-live it, but immediately went and hang'd himſelf. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> delivers it as his Opinion, that the Provocation which enrag'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him to the killing his old Friend <hi>Clytus,</hi> was not ſo much any Offence he took at what he ſaid, as the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſaying what he did before Company. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly yet, We muſt be ſure to forbear all Liberties of this kind, before thoſe Perſons, whoſe Approbation and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, either the Perſon is ambitious and tender of, or the Character he bears renders neceſſary to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be done to either Husband or Wife before each other; nor to a Parent before Children; nor to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter before his Servants, nor to a Miniſter or Teacher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Pariſhioners or Scholars.</item>
                                    <item>4. It ſhould be deliver'd with a plain, eaſie, unaffected Freedom; ſomewhat that looks unſtudy'd, and as it were by the bye: And, to be ſure, without any regard to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, or the leaſt Appearance of Paſſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</item>
                                    <item>5. This is capable of being ſoſten'd a little, by including our own ſelves, and not ſeeming to confine the Blame to Him alone, as if it were a ſtrange or particular thing; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our Senſe likewiſe in general Terms; as thus: <hi>We are all apt to forget our ſelves upon theſe Occaſions; One would
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:53648:561"/>wonder what Men think of, when they do ſuch things;</hi> or the like.</item>
                                    <item>6. A Man ſhould always begin with the Commendations of ſomething that is good or well-done in his Friend, and cloſe all with Tenders of Service and Aſſiſtance; (This ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and takes off very much from the Smart and Severity of the Correction; and makes the neceſſary bitter Pill go down more glibly) And then by comparing theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we may ſhew the Miſcarriage more evidently; as thus: <hi>Such a Thing becomes you, and you do mighty well in it; I wiſh I could ſay as much of this:</hi> Or, <hi>Good lack! what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between ſuch an Action of Yours, and ſuch an one! Who could ever imagine that Pieces ſo unlike could ever be done by the ſame Hand?</hi>
                                    </item>
                                    <item>7. It is likewiſe adviſable, to expreſs the Fault in Phraſes as ſoft and gentle as we can, and ſuch as fall very much ſhort of the Enormity and real Proportion of the thing. For inſtance; inſtead of <hi>You have done very ill;</hi> to ſay, <hi>Sure you did not conſider what you did; you were miſtaken, or not well aware;</hi> or the like. Inſtead of <hi>Have nothing to do with this Woman, why ſhould you ruine your ſelf upon her Account? Pray never think of entertaing a Woman, who will certainly be the Ruin of you:</hi> Inſtead of deſiring him not to bear <hi>ſuch an one a Grudge;</hi> to beg, <hi>that be would engage in no diſpute, nor concern himſelf with him.</hi>
                                    </item>
                                    <item>8. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When the Buſineſs is over, a Man muſt not immediately leave the Party with uneaſie Impreſſions upon his Mind; for theſe will but ferment there, and gall him; and therefore it is neceſſary he ſhould ſtay with him till all that Uneaſineſs be got over: In order whereunto, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to turn his Diſcourſe upon ſome common entertaining Subject, which may divert the preſent remembrance of the Reprehenſion, and bring them to part very good Friends, and in perfect Humour.</item>

It is a Thouſand times worſe than Falſe-witneſs: That deceives and miſ-leads the Judge, it draws a Sentence from him, wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in it ſelf; but not ſo with regard to Him; for his Will and Judgment are blameleſs: They proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Matters appear in Evidence; and ſo the Man preſerves his Integrity ſtill: But here the very Mind and Judgment is debauch'd; the Soul is charm'd and bewitch'd, made incapable of improving in the Knowledge of the Truth, and utterly averſe from the Love of it. It is a Rank and ſpreading Evil; for if once a Prince be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Flattery, and fond of it, there is a neceſſity that all about him, who deſire to be well in his Opinion, and hope to make their Fortunes by his Favour, ſhould turn Flatterers. For Intereſt and Ambition will not fail to make Converts enough; and the Rule theſe govern themſelves by, is to ſtudy and practiſe what they ſee agreeable, and likely to recommend them moſt to the good Graces of their Patron. Whatever can be ſaid to ſhew the Excellence of Truth, all That proves the Baſeneſs and Deformity of Flattery: They who eſteem and adore the one, muſt in proportion deſpiſe and deteſt the other; which indeed is nothing elſe but the Corruption and Perverting of the Truth. It is a pitiful mean Vice, the Submiſſion of a poor degenerate Spirit; an Effeminacy and Weakneſs, as unbecoming a Man, as Gariſhneſs, and Affected Confidence is to a Woman.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There are two Sorts of Perſons, who lie open to Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and as they never want ſawning People, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to offer them this Traſh; ſo they for the moſt part as greedily receive and ſwallow it. Theſe are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with whom theſe Huckſters get into Credit, and grow acceptable by this means; and the Ladies, who are ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly delighted with hearing well of themſelves, that the moſt uſual and ſucceſsful Stratagem for corrupting their Virtue, is generally thought to be the entertaining them with their own Commendations.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is really very hard to avoid the Danger of Flattery, and ſo to arm and ſtrengthen our Minds, that they ſhall be proof againſt all its Inſinuations. 'Tis particularly ſo to Women, by reaſon of their natural Diſpoſition, which by a Weakneſs almoſt univerſal to the Sex, inclines them to be fond of Vanity, and greedy of Praiſe. And it muſt needs be ſo to Princes; by reaſon their Relations, and Friends, and prime Miniſters, ſuch as they muſt of neceſſity hold conſtant converſation with, are all bred up to this Trade, and value themſelves upon being expert and dextrous in it. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was ſo great a Monarch, with all the Philoſophy of his Tutor <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to Arm him, could not ſtand againſt it. And, tho' we commonly pretend to leſſen and condemn Kings for ſuffering themſelves to be thus impoſed upon, yet there is never an one of us all, but, if we were in Their Circumſtances, and perpetually laid at by Paraſites and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants, as They are, we ſhould be a Thouſand Times worſe than They. No Man of ordinary Condition can be a competent Judge in this caſe, becauſe he cannot have any Thing like the Tryals and Temptations of an elevated Poſt. But, tho' Flattery, like Diſeaſes, do not ſeize all Perſons and Conſtitutions alike, yet contagious it is, and no Man lives utterly out of the reach of its venomous Infection. There is ſomewhat ſo agreeable, that even They who hate and ſeem moſt to reject it, conceive a ſecret Pleaſure, and ſhut the Door againſt it ſo faintly, that after many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Denyals, it is let in, and kindly entertain'd in private. That which adds to the danger is, that Men are tainted by it inſenſibly; for it is ſo cunningly varniſh'd over, ſo
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:53648:563"/>diſguis'd with a Mask of Friendſhip, which it affects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to wear, that one cannot very eaſily diſtinguiſh between them. It uſurps and invades all her good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, puts on her Air and Countenance, calls it ſelf by her Name, counterfeits her Voice; in ſhort, obſerves the Tone, the Meen, the Readlineſs, the Zeal; ſo that you would ſwear it could be none but ſhe. The Buſineſs of Flattery is to pleaſe, and be taking: It pays marvellous Reſpect and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is very liberal in Praiſes, exceeding officious and eager to ſerve the Perſon apply'd to, and careful to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in good Humour; or indeed in any Humour that prevails, and will be moſt agreeable at that time. Nay, to ſhew how exquiſite the Hypocriſie of this Vice is, it goes a great deal farther, and ventures upon the laſt and higheſt, the ſevereſt and moſt dangerous Act of Friendſhip, and is free and full in its Expoſtulations and Reproofs. In own Word, the Flatterer's Care is always to profeſs and make himſelf believ'd much more ſincere and paſſionate in his Affection and Concern for the Perſon whom he addreſſes to, than he is or can be to Him in return. But all theſe boaſting and pompous Pretenſions notwithſtanding, there is not in the World any thing more deſtructive of true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Ill Language, Affronts, open and avowed Enmity, are not in reality greater Contradictions, how different ſoever they are in Figure and outward Shew. It is the very Bane of all Sincerity and true Love; they are irreconcilable, and cannot dwell together.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non potes me ſimul Amico &amp; Adulatore uti.</note> When once I am your Friend, I ceaſe to Flatter; and when I begin to Flatter, from that very inſtant you may conclude me none of your Friend. And therefore that Obſervation is moſt true,<note n="†" place="bottom">Meliora vulnera diligentis, quàm oſcula blandientis.</note> That the Wounds and Strokes of a Friend are better and more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than the Kiſſes of a Flatterer. Thoſe, tho' we feel ſome Pain in them, are yet well intended, and may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our Benefit and Amendment. Theſe are ſoft and ſmooth, but full of Treachery and Miſchief; and the End of all thoſe kind Careſſes, is to keep us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with our ſelves, and ſo to lead us hoodwink'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ruin.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Since therefore it ſo highly concerns us not to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon this Occaſion, and ſince the knowing theſe two ſo very contrary Qualities aſunder, is no ſuch obvious and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:53648:563"/>eaſie Matter; I ſhall endeavour to draw off the Vizor; and draw, if not the whole Face, yet ſo many of the Features and principal Lines of it, as that by theſe Strokes my Reader may be able to diſtinguiſh Flattery and Friendſhip from each other.
<list>
                                    <item>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Flattery is always follow'd cloſe at the Heels by private Intereſt and Advantage: This is the Scent it follows, and you may know it by the manner of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Game it purſues: But a Friend is generous, and undeſigning; hath no By-Ends, nor is Self at the bottom of what he does continually.</item>
                                    <item>2. A Flatterer is perpetually veering and changeable in his Judgment and Opinion of Things; like a Looking-Glaſs, that readily reflects all Faces, or Wax prepar'd to receive any manner of Impreſſions. He is a Camelion, a Polypus, never of one Colour and Complexion, longer than you determine and encourage him to it. If you appear to commend and love a Man, he admires and exalts him to the Skies; pretend Diſlike, or Reſentment, or Averſion, He tacks about ſtreight, and is in with you There too; he cenſures, condemns, aggravates, as he finds You ſtand affected: For You are the Principal, the Subſtance, the Original; and He your Image, your Repreſentation, the Shadow, the Copy, the conſtant Attendant and Mimick of all you are, and ſay, and do; affecting every Motion, and putting on every Shape, as he ſees his Pattern alter. Whereas a Friend is firm, and uniform, and conſiſtent with himſelf; For Truth and Reaſon are the Compaſs he ſteers by, and theſe are fix'd and unchangeable.</item>
                                    <item>3. Another Mark to diſtinguiſh him by, is his Carriage; which is always eager, and officious to a great exceſs; and eſpecially in ſuch things as he is ſenſible will be obſerv'd, or otherwiſe like to come to the Knowledge of the Perſon he addreſſes to; and, as in all other reſpects, ſo is he particularly forward in his Commendations, in proffering his Service and doing every little thing that may look like Deference and Zeal. In all his Behaviour there is nothing of Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Moderation; and yet, as fair a Shew as all this makes outwardly to the World, there is not any ſolid Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, not one Grain of cordial Affection within. Now a Friend is the very Reverſe of all This; an Enemy to Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and large Pretences; and content, that the Sincerity of his Kindneſs ſhould prove it ſelf by ſolid and ſubſtantial Teſtimonies: Not at all the leſs diſpoſed to act as becomes
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:53648:564"/>his Character, tho' he were ſure that he ſhould never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, or thank'd for it: And therefore the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his Heart and Intentions, often puts him upon ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying ſecret ways of obliging; and, provided his own Duty be done, and his Conſcience ſatisfy'd, he can very well abate the publiſhing his Endeavours to ſerve his Friend.</item>
                                    <item>4. The Flatterer conſtantly yields the Prize to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, declares him in the Right in all he ſays, applauds his Prudence in all he does, and this without any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but only to pleaſe, and render himſelf agreeable. Hence it is, that he over-ſhoots the Mark ſo much, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending All without Diſtinction, and All extravagantly and in exceſs. Nay ſometimes he will not grudge to do it at his own expence, and to leſſen his own Deſert, that he may magniſie his Patron's. Like Wreſtlers, that ſtoop and bend, only to ſhew the Cunning of their Play, and mend their Hold; that ſo they may gain the Advantage of throwing the Adverſary a fairer Fall. Now a Friend goes to work plainly and bluntly; Preference and Eſteem are of ſmall Conſideration with Him; nor is his Deſign ſo much to pleaſe and miniſter Delight, as to bring ſubſtantial Proſit, and to do much Good; and what way this is done is of little concern to him; he is not nice and ſcrupulous in the Choice of Methods; but, like a good Phyſician, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Caſe and the Neceſſities of his Patient; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his ſharp and painful, or his gentler Remedies, not according as they ſute the Palate, but the Exigencies of his Friend. Recovery and Amendment is his End and Buſineſs, and all things elſe are indifferent to him, except ſo far as they may prove ſubſervient to this Great Deſign.</item>
                                    <item>5. Sometimes he will needs take upon him to rebuke his Friend, but he does it ſo very aukwardly, that a Man may eaſily diſcern This to be only a Copy of his Countenance; and that at the ſame time he puts on the Hardineſs of a Friend, his chief Care is not to incur Diſpleaſure by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Matters too roughly. To this purpoſe he will be ſure to ſix upon light and trivial Faults only, or ſome very excuſable Defect, pretending himſelf blind all the while to thoſe that are groſſer, and much more obnoxious to Cenſure and Reproach. He will expreſs himſelf with great Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Bitterneſs againſt Relations, or Acquaintance, or Servants, as if They were wanting in the Diligence and Reſpects due from them. Or elſe he will introduce the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:53648:564"/>he takes with a Pretence of ſome idle Stories he hath heard, and profeſs great Sollicitude to be inform'd of the Truth from his own Mouth, that ſo he may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing him Service in a juſt Vindication of his Innocence. And, when his Patron either denies the Fact, or excuſes himſelf, he will not fail to catch at this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exſpatiating in his Praiſe, <q>I confeſs, <hi>Sir, ſays he,</hi> this was a wonderful Surpriſe to me, and what I could not prevail with my ſelf to give Credit to. I was ſatisfied I knew you better; for how is it poſſible you ſhould be guilty of any ſuch Thing? I told your Enemies who taxed you with Injuſtice, that they, muſt pardon me, if I was peremptory to the Contrary. For who could imagine that you ſhould invade another's Right, who are ſo far from inſiſting Rigorouſly upon your own? One, who to my Knowledge is ſo Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo Bountiful, ſo Charitable, could never, you may be ſure, paſs upon me for a griping or covetous Man. Such Jealouſies, I ſaid, might find Entertainment with Strangers, but with me, who have the Honour to be ſo well acquainted with your Virtues, they would all go for nothing.</q> Or elſe he takes Occaſion to chide him kindly, for having no more Care of himſelf, and expoſing that Perſon ſo much, which is of ſuch infinite Importance to the Publick; as one of the Senators particularly is ſaid to have curried Favour with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in a full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, after a very nauſeous and fulſome manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing.</item>
                                    <item>6. In a Word; I ſhall need to add but this One Mark of Diſtinction more. A true Friend always regards, and adviſes, and promotes that which is agreable to Reaſon, and Duty; he conſults the Character and Circumſtances of the Perſon; and obſerves what is ſitteſt and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming; but the Flatterer ſpies out a blind Side, and ſtrikes in with Pleaſure, and Intereſt, and Inclination. So that no Man is ſo proper an Inſtrument for corrupting Mens Principles, and ſoothing them in all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and Vice: None ſo improper for the putting forward any thing of Virtue, or Difficulty; or Danger. Indeed he is like an Ape, that ſerves to none of thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Uſes which other Creatures are aſſiſting to us in; but ſeems cut out merely for the Jeſt and Diverſion of Mankind.</item>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To this Vice of Flattery, That of Lying is very near of Kin,<note place="margin">Lying.</note> and uſually goes along with it: And This is likewiſe of the ſame infamous Quality; a mean, and diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and raſcally Vice. For what can be more Deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Baſe, than for a Man to ſpeak contrary to his own Knowledge and Senſe of Things? The firſt and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Step toward the Corruption of Manners, is the baniſhing Truth out of our Diſcourſe; as on the Contrary, the Courage and Reſolution to be true, is, according to <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar's</hi> Account of it, the Beginning and Foundation of a Brave and Eminent Virtue. But, beſides the Deſpicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Vice in it ſelf, it is likewiſe highly Deſtructive to Humane Society. For we ceaſe to be Men, and are looſe from all the mutual Tyes, and Securities poſſible to be had upon one another, when mutual Confidence, and Truth, the only ground of it, is loſt. Speech indeed is rightly ſaid to capacitate Mankind for Society; but if once That be abuſed to Falſhood and Deceit, Silence is a Thouſand times the more ſociable Quality of the Two. If a Lye indeed were conſtant to it ſelf, and wore but one Face, as Truth does, then there would be ſome Hopes at leaſt, and the Miſchief were more tolerable; for we might depend upon it, that the direct Contrary of what the Lyar ſays is True. But alas! it is our Misfortune, that the Reverſe of Truth hath a Hundred Thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shapes, and the Space it ranges in is Infinite. Good, (that is, Virtue and Truth) is certain and circumſcribed, ſtaked down to One ſingle Spot, and fixed beyond the Power of Variation, as there can be but One Way to hit the Mark. But Evil, (that is, Vice and Errour) is Infinite and Uncertain, and there are a Thouſand Ways to ſhoot beſide the Mark: For ſhort or beyond, too high or too low, on this or on that Side, all are wide of the Matter. Without all Doubt could Mankind be made duly ſenſible of the Horror, and miſchievous Conſequences of Lying, they would be ſo far from practiſing or giving the leaſt Countenance to ſuch Wickedneſs, that they would ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drive it out of the World with Fire and Sword; and think no Puniſhments too ſevere, no Methods too cruel for the utter Extermination of it. And This is a good Hint to thoſe, who make the Education of Youth their Care, with what Vigilance the very firſt Tendencies to this Evil ought to be obſerved, and the Growth of it prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppoſed. This ſhould be their firſt Buſineſs, and
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:53648:565"/>the Checking of a poſitive and obſtinate Humor their next; and both theſe ſhould be taken down betimes; for otherwiſe the Corruption of Nature will be beforehand with us; and it is ſcarce to be conceived indeed, how very early ſuch rank Weeds ſpring, and how prodigiouſly they ſhoor, if not nipt in the Bud.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But Men may be guilty of Lying in their Actions, as well as in their Diſcourſe;<note place="margin">Hypocriſie.</note> for what elſe is all that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Diſſimulation, ſo generally practiſed in the World? This, I confeſs, is repreſented as an Accompliſhment, and hath obtain'd the Character and Reputation of Complaiſance and good Breeding. But yet, let the Men of refined Manners ſay what they will, it is in reality a Blemiſh and Diſhonour, a mean Submiſſion, and baſe Degeneracy of Soul, for a Man to appear abroad always in Diſguiſe. To walk with a Mask, and not dare to ſhew his Face to the World. Let Men talk of Honour as long as they will, Honour can never be conſiſtent with Diſſimulation; and He that is an Hypocrite is certainly the greateſt Coward, the moſt abject Slave.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Now, whoever he be, that ſets up this Trade, he will find enough to do to maintain his Credit, or his Eaſe by it. For a Hypocrite is under perpetual Conſtraint. And what a Torment muſt it needs be, for a Man always to appear Different from what he is really, and in his own Nature? What a conſtant Eye muſt he have upon every Word, and Action, what Jealouſies of all he converſes with, what anxious Fears of being diſcover'd and expoſed? The Difficulty and Diſquiet of concealing one's Temper, is a perfect Hell upon Earth; and the being found out is an intolerable Confuſion and Reproach. If there be ſuch a Thing as perfect Eaſe and Pleaſure attainable here below, it is certainly to be found only in a Freedom and Openneſs, and Security of Mind and Converſation. And a Man had better let the World ſee the Worſt of him, though he Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ſomething leſs in their Eſteem for his plain downright Behaviour; than be always ſtraining to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſome good Qualities which he hath not, or to keep ſome ill one's out of Sight. So Amiable, ſo Noble is this Frankneſs of Temper, that even Reputation it ſelf, as valuable as it is, cannot make ſufficient Reparation for the parting with it.</p>
                              <p>But, beſides that this is a difficult and laborious Trade, it is a poor and paltry One; for moſt Men Break of it in
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:53648:566"/>a very little while. Diſſimulation cannot go very ſat; It will be diſcovered at one time or other, and leave thoſe that depend upon it, in the Lurch. It is a common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and daily Experince proves it to be as true as it is common, that Nothing which is either Violent or Counterfeit continues long. Herein, Art and Force differ from Nature, that They decay by Time, and This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves by it. And, when once ſuch Men are detected, all they get by it is, never to be truſted afterwards; to have no Streſs laid upon what they Do, nor any Credit given to what they Say. Nay, Truth it ſelf ſuffers by this means, and can gain no reception, when it comes out of their Mouths. And how Deſpicable a Wretch is That, whoſe Authority is loſt, and whoſe Example goes for nothing; whoſe whole Life is look'd upon as one continued Banter; and his moſt ſerious Actions are thought to ſmell ſo rank of Trick and Deſign, that they only ſerve to awaken Mens Suſpicion, and warn them to be more upon their Guard?</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Now, this is a Caſe capable of being miſunderſtood, and miſapply'd; and therefore, as there is ſome room left for, ſo indeed there is great need of Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to prevent an Errour in the other Extreme. For if a Man's Diſpoſition be crooked and deform'd; if there be any thing vicious and offenſive to the World; this ought certainly to be kept in; or, to ſpeak more properly, be brought into Shape: For there is a vaſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between living eaſie and unconſtrained; and being rude, and ſlovenly, and careleſs in our Behaviour. We ſhould not take Pains to impoſe upon thoſe we converſe with; but we are not therefore bound to turn their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs. A Man ſhould not tell a Lye; but he is not oblig'd to tell all the Truth neither. That then, which we are to take Care of in this Point, is, to ſpeak as much as is convenient, and to be ſure that all we do ſpeak be True; To diſtinguiſh between Twatling and Openneſs in Converſation; and in Behaviour between a Freedom conſiſtent with Sincerity and Good Manners; and a Moroſe Indifference, which breaks through all Reſerves, and declares War with all Decency and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> There are indeed Two ſorts of People, in whom Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is in ſome Degree excuſable; I might ſay indeed, Neceſſary and Becoming; but the Reaſons which vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and uphold them in it, are very different from each
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:53648:566"/>other. The Firſt are Princes, who, as I have obſerved before, may ſometimes be obliged to diſſemble upon very important Conſiderations. The Publick Good, the Safety of their Perſons, the Peace of the Government may require it; all theſe might be ruined and loſt, if the Counſels and Methods that ſupport them, were carried ſo openly, that every Stander by could ſee through, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the bottom of the Governour's Deſigns. And therefore, taking the Condition of the World as it now ſtands, ſo full of Treachery and Villany; it is no Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Juſtice or Religion to ſay, that Princes may be allowed ſome Meaſures in their Publick Character, which neither They, nor any other Man, is privileged to take in his private one. Would all their Subjects be Faithful and do their Duty, then indeed the Rules of Political, and Private Virtue would be the ſame; but now Men muſt be governed, not according to what they ſhould be, but to what they actually are. And, as Laws, when made for the Reformation of Vice, ſuppoſe the worſt of Men; ſo the Adminiſtrators of thoſe Laws, muſt by their Warineſs and Wiſdom provide againſt the Worſt.</p>
                              <p>The Second ſort of Diſſimulation in ſome Degree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, is in Women; and the Reaſon that enforces it, is Decency, and the Gracefulneſs of Modeſty and Reſerve, in Their Sex more eſpecially: For what would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted Freedom and Aſſuredneſs in a Man, would in one of them be condemned for Impudence. And therefore the little Diſguiſes in their Carriage and Looks, the making up their Mouth, and affected Ignorances, look pretty enough; and have a becoming Air of Baſhfulneſs and Innocence: And beſides, Theſe do no manner of hurt; for they paſs for Things of Courſe, and no body but Fools and Men ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unacquainted with the World, can ever be impoſed upon by them. But This is a Trouble I might have ſpared my ſelf; for the Sex are ſo naturally addicted to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that it is very needleſs to recommend, or to inſtruct them in it. They are indeed a fair Outſide all over; their Faces, their Cloths, their Talk, their Looks, their Smiles, their Tears, have all but too much of Art in them; and are contrived to make a Shew: Nay, which is ſtill Worſe, they do not only diſſemble with the Living, but with the Dead too; The Long Veil, and the Dark Room; the Bed ſo many Days, and the Chamber ſo many Weeks; what are theſe but the Pomp and Pretence of Sorrow.

                              <p>THE Art of doing and receiving Good Offices, as That Reſpects the Beneficence of the Donor, and the Obligation and Gratitude in the Perſon to whom they are done, is a Subject of great Compaſs, and Extent; of great Uſe, but withal of much Intricacy, and Difficulty. There is not any one Inſtance, in which Men are more Deficient. Very few know, either how to oblige, or how to be obliged, as becomes them. It looks as if Goodneſs, and Deſert, and Gratitude were in the Declenſion; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Ingratitude in the Aſcendent; as if Thoſe were a Loſs and Diminution, and Theſe a Gain and Privilege; ſo eager and zealous we are generally in the former, ſo ſo very cold and indifferent, ſo averſe indeed to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, that<note n="†" place="bottom">Gratia oneri eſt, Ultio in quaeſtu habetur. Altiùs Injuriae qàum merita deſcendunt.</note> 
                                 <hi>Thanks are reputed Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but Revenge an Advantage;</hi> and <hi>Seneta,</hi> That <hi>Injuries and Affronts make much deeper Impreſſion than Favours and Kindneſs.</hi> We will therefore endeavour at preſent to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and redreſs this ſo common Defect; (or Corruption rather,) of Mankind; by treating at preſent, Firſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, under which I comprehend Humanity, Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:53648:567"/>Charity or Relief of the Poor and Diſtreſſed; and of their Contraries, Inhumanity, Niggardlineſs, Want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: And then Secondly, of the Obligation, the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Receiver, or the Neglect, and Ingratitude after ſuch Kindneſſes received.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Which Way ſoever we turn our Eyes, they are every where preſented with Arguments and Inſtances,<note place="margin">Motive to Beneficence.</note> for the Exerciſe of Kindneſs, and Beneficence. God, and Nature, and Univerſal Reaſon, and Equity, All joyn in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to it, In God, whether we conſider his Effence, or his Providence, what he is, and what he does, we ſee nothing but Goodneſs; for He is the very Perfection of it, Goodneſs it ſelf; and That not a ſpeculative and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profirable Excellence, but the moſt diffuſive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Goodneſs; and<note n="*" place="bottom">Nullà re propius ad Dei naturam accedimus, quam Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia: Dei eſt mortalem ſuccurrere mortali.</note> 
                                 <hi>of all the Reſomblances and Imitations of the Divinity that Human Nature is capable of, the neareſt Approach we can make toward him is in this Particular;</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> very juſtly obſerved. And <hi>Pliny; when one Man ſuccors another, he does an Act more than Human, and becomes as it were a God to his Brother.</hi> The Inducements, which Nature furniſhes us with, are many. Such as, The ſenſible Satisfaction a Man feels in ſeeing the Perſon whom he hath obliged; the Conſideration, that he is a Perſon of the ſame Condition with himſelf, caſt in the ſame Mould, wrought up of the ſame Materials, a Tranſcript of the ſame Original; For<note n="†" place="bottom">Nihil tam ſecundum Naturam, quam juvare conſortem Naturae.</note> 
                                 <hi>nothing is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Dictates of Nature, as to aſſiſt one who is a Partaker of the ſame Nature;</hi> It is a Generous and Noble Act; worthy a Perſon of Honour and Virtue, to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficial to others, to embrace and improve, nay, to ſeek Opportunities of being ſo. For the<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Liberalis etiam dandi cauſas quaerit.</note> 
                                 <hi>Liberal Man does not content himſelf with taking them when they come in his Way; but he goes out to meet, and takes Pains to find them.</hi> And it is an old Adage, that Truly Noble Blood will neither let a Man tell a Lye, nor be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Offices, where they are Seaſonable. There is ſomewhat of Greatneſs and commendable Pride in doing Kindneſſes, as there is of Meanneſs in having them done
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:53648:568"/>to us; and this may be one convenient Senſe of that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes to our Saviour; <hi>It is more Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give than to receive.</hi> He that gives, gets himſelf Honour, and gains an Advantage; he becomes Maſter of the Receiver, and acquires a Right in him; as on the other hand, the Receiver ſells his Freedom, and is no longer at his own diſpoſal. The Firſt Inventer of Good Offices, (ſays one with Ingenuity enough) contrived the ſtrongeſt Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ever were, to bind and captivate Mankind. Upon this Account ſeveral People have refuſed to accept of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, becauſe they would not ſuffer their Liberty to be entrenched upon; and particularly, if the Perſon confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Favour were one, whom they had no Kindneſs for, and did not care to be obliged to. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is, that the old Philoſophers forbid us to receive any Kindneſſes from ill Men, becauſe in ſo doing we let them get a Hank upon us. <hi>Caeſar</hi> uſed to ſay, that no Muſick was ſo charming in his Ears, as the Requeſts of his Friends, and the Supplications of thoſe in want.

                                 <hi>ſo will I hoar thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> This is likewiſe the moſt Honourable way of employing our Power and Plenty; which, while we keep by us, and in our own private Poſſeſſion, are called by the mean Names, of Houſes, and Lands, and Money; but when drawn out into Uſe, and expended to the Benefit of our Brethren, they are dignified with new and Auguſt Titles; and from thenceforth commence Good Actions, Liberality, Magnificence, Alms, and Treaſures in Heaven. Nay it is not only the moſt Honourable, but the moſt prudent and profitable Method of trafficking with them;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ars quaeſtuoſiſſima, optima Negotiatio.</note> 
                                 <hi>the gainfulleſt of all Arts, the beſt and leaſt hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Way of Merchandiſe;</hi> for here the Principal is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Intereſt ariſing upon it riſes exceeding high. And, to ſay the very truth, no part of what we have is ſo properly our Own, none turns to ſuch a prodigious Increaſe, ſo comfortable Account, as that which we expend upon good Uſes. What lies by us is lock'd up, and hid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; it lies and waſts; or at leaſt it never grows upon our Hands; and it is ſure to give us the Slip at laſt, either by ſome of thoſe infinite Accidents, by which all ſuch Things
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:53648:568"/>are liable to be ſnatch'd from Us; or by that certain and inevitable Separation, by which Death will ſhortly ſnarch Us away from Them. But ſo much of theſe as is thus put out, can never fail, never be wreſted from us; never ruſt, or decay, or lie buried in Unprofitableneſs.

As indeed, on the other Hand, nothing is ſo Mean and Sneaking, ſo Deteſtable and Deſpicable, ſo Deformed and Unnatural, as Hard-heartedneſs, and Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of other Peoples Misfortunes; It is therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly ſtyled Inhumanity; to intimate by that Name, that ſuch People are Monſters, and not Men. And, as the Vices themſelves, ſo the Source and Cauſes of them ſtand in direct Oppoſition to each other. For, as Beneficence ſprings from Greatneſs and Gallantry of Spirit, ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Parſimony and Hard-heartedneſs is the Spawn of Cowardice, and Brutiſh Degeneracy of Soul.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now, there are two ways of becoming Beneficial to our Neighbours; either as we miniſter to their Profit, <note place="margin">Several ſorts of it.</note> or to their Pleaſure. The Firſt procures us Admiration and Eſteem; the Second Love, and good Will. The Firſt is much more valuable, becauſe it regards Mens Neceſſities and Diſtreſſes; it is acting the Part of a Tender Father, and a True Friend. There is likewiſe a Difference in theſe Acts of Kindneſs themſelves; Some are due from us, ſuch as the Laws of Nature, or poſitive Inſtitution require at our Hands; Others are free, and what we are under no expreſs Obligation for, but the Effect of pure Choice, and Love. The Latter of theſe Two ſorts, ſeem to be more Brave and Generous; But yet the Former too, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Application, and Prudence, and ſincere Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, are very Excellent and Commendable, though they have the Nature of a Debt, and are ſuch as we cannot be faithful to our Duty, and diſpenſe with our ſelves in.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now the true Beneficence or Kindneſs is not properly in the Gift it ſelf, <note place="margin">Internal and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> that which a Man ſees, and feels, and taſts; this is too groſs a Notion; and all we that can allow, is that Theſe are the Matter, the Signs, and the Demonſtrations of our Kindneſs; but the Thing it ſelf is the Diſpoſition and good Heart. The Outward and viſible part may be very ſmall and inconſiderable; and yet that within may at the ſame time be wondrous great. For This may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an exceeding Eagerneſs and Affection; a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt of doing good; watching, and contriving, and ſeeking Occaſions for it; and eſteeming ſuch Actions in our Saviour's Terms, <hi>One's Meat and Drink;</hi> ſnatching them as greedily, and receiving as ſenſible a Satisfaction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from them, as from the moſt neceſſary Refreſhments, by which this Life of ours is ſuſtain'd. A Man may have given to the very utmoſt of his Ability, and by this means exhauſt that little Store, which is ſcarce ſufficient for his own Occaſions; or he may part with that which is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly valuable and dear to him. Theſe are the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that enhanced the value of the Widow's Mite; and render'd one ſmall piece of Money, not equal only, but far ſuperiour to all the large Donations of the Rich Contributors. And thus Heathen Authors have likewiſe concurr'd in their Eſtimate of good Works.<note n="*" place="bottom">In Beneſieio Hoc ſuſpieiendum, quod alteri dedit, ablaturus ſibi, utilitatis ſuae oblitus.</note> 
                                 <hi>In every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we are to have a more than ordinary reſpect to that, which a Man by relieving his Neighbour, ſtreightens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in; and for the ſake of another's Convenience and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, poſtpones and forgets his own.</hi> On the other Hand, where the Gift it ſelf is large, the Obligation may be very ſmall; and indeed, in great Gifts there are ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which moſt commonly make it ſo. For ſuch are beſtow'd frequently with Unwillingneſs and Reluctancy: They expect to be much intreated, and long attended for them, and take time to conſider, whether they ſhall beſtow them or not: Now This hath too much of Pomp and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in it; ſuch a Man is deſirous to magnifie his own Bounty; and after all, he gives more to gratifie his own Vanity and Ambition, than to ſupply the Neceſſities of them that want; and ſo Himſelf is the Giver and Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both. But that which gives another very juſt Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Caſe before us, is. That the External Benefit may
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:53648:569"/>be preſently wreſted from us again; or if not by Fraud and Force, yet it may be ſpent, or loſt; it may decay upon our Hands, and in proceſs of time vaniſh quite; but the inward Diſpoſition, with which it was conferred, is permanent and firm. The Liberty, or the Health, the Wealth, or Honour, or Preferment beſtow'd upon us, may by ſome freſh Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be loſt in an inſtant; but ſtill the Kindneſs and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation remains entire.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now the Directions, by which a Man may do well to govern himſelf in the exerciſe of this excellent Virtue, <note place="margin">Rules for Beneficence.</note> are ſuch as follow.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, With regard to the Perſons; who are the proper Objects of our Liberality, and whether it be fit to extend it to All, as their Wants, and our own Abilities furniſh Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for it. This is a very reaſonable Enquiry, and highly neceſſary to be reſolv'd; becauſe, by doing good to wicked Men, and ſuch as do not deſerve our Kindneſs, a Man may ſeem to be guilty of a great many Faults at once. This derives Cenſure and an ill Name upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and expoſes his Bounty to very vile Interpretations; It hardens and ſupports ſuch People in their Wickedneſs and Extravagance; breeds Envy and malicious Thoughts; takes away all Diſtinctions between the Good and the Bad, by allowing the ſame Countenance and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Vice, which is due to Virtue and Deſert. For certainly thoſe Aſſiſtances, which depend upon our own free Choice, and are the Effect of Grace, and not any Debt by virtue of Obligation and Duty, Worth and Goodneſs have the beſt Title to; but yet extreme Neceſſity, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Good of Mankind lay all in common. In theſe two Caſes none are excluded, but even the Wicked and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful have Right to come in for a Share, if their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are urgent; and if they be ſo mingl'd and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd with the Good, that One cannot enjoy the Benefit, without the Other partaking of it too. And undoubtedly it is much better to do good to thoſe who do not deſerve it for the ſake of them that do; than to with-hold our Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thoſe that do deſerve, in revenge, and for the diſcouragement of Them who do not. Accordingly we ſee, that God ſets us a daily example of Univerſal Beneficence, <hi>He cauſeth his Sun to riſe on the Evil and on the Good; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Rain to the Juſt and to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> Theſe are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a general Providence: But then he beſtows, over and above theſe, ſome ſpecial Bleſſings, which are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:53648:570"/>of a diſtinguiſhing Providence; There he makes choice of his own Faithful and Beloved ones; and that Rule mention'd by our Bleſſed Lord takes place; <hi>It is not meet to take the Children's Bread, and to caſt it unto Dogs.</hi>
                                 <note n="*" place="bottom">Multum refert, utrum aliquem non excludas, an eligas.</note> 
                                 <hi>There is a vaſt deal of difference</hi> (ſays the Philoſopher) <hi>between not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Man, and making him your Choice.</hi> In Caſes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, when Affliction and Neceſſity cry aloud for preſent Redreſs and Aſſiſtance, we ſhould extend our Charity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtinction of Merit, and it will not ſerve us to ſay, that Men are unworthy.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hominibus prodeſſe Natura jubet ubicunque Homini bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio locus.</note> 
                                 <hi>Nature calls upon us to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to all without exception;</hi> and the Conſideration of his being a Man is ſufficient to excite our Compaſſion, when Opportunities of doing Good offer themſelves to us. Humanity bids us bear a tender regard, and lend our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to thoſe that ſeek, and ſtretch out their Hands to implore our help; not to purſue them, who turn their Backs upon us: And our Kindneſs is much more due, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſtow'd, where we are able to do good, than where They who receive it are capable of doing good to Us. It is an Act of Generoſity to take the weaker Side, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thoſe that are ſinking, to heal a broken Fortune, and ſupport a drooping Spirit, and to rob the Conqueror of his Pride and Triumph, by ſnatching the Spoils, and reſcuing the vanquiſh'd Prey out of his Hand. Thus <hi>Chelomis</hi> is ſaid to have done. She was both the Wife and Daughter of a King. Theſe two Princes had a Diſpute with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in which, while her Husband had the Advantage, ſhe ſhewed her ſelf a dutiful Daughter, and follow'd her Father's Fortunes, never forſaking him in his greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; but when the Chance of War turn'd, and caſt the Scale on the other ſide, then She turn'd too, and left her Father to enjoy his Proſperity; and thought This a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon to exert the Affection and Fidelity of a Wife, by ſticking cloſe to her Husband in his Calamitous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A Second Rule for the Exerciſe of this Virtue is to do it frankly and cheerfully; <hi>Not grudgingly, or of neceſſity,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul; for God loveth a cheerful giver.</hi> And<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Bis eſt gratum, quod opus eſt, ſi ultro ofteras.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you do is doubly welcome, when what is ſeaſonable and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:53648:570"/>neceſſary comes of its own accord,</hi> without ſtaying to be ask'd, or preſs'd to it. For ſo much of Entreaty and Attendance às it coſts, ſo much of the Value and Satisfaction is abated. And<note n="*" place="bottom">
                                    <p>Nemo Iubenter debet, quod non accepit, ſed expreſſit.</p>
                                    <p>Non tulit gratis, qui accepit rogans; imò nihil charius emitur, quàm quod Precibus.</p>
                                 </note> 
                                 <hi>No Man takes any great Joy in being beholding to a Man for that which he did not ſo properly receive, as extort.</hi> That which is gotten by Importunity is dear bought: He that obtains by dint of asking, ought not to eſteem his Supply a Gift; for Attendance, and Addreſs, and earneſt Supplications are a very high Price, and pay well for the Purchaſe. He that asks, humbles and debaſes himſelf; he acknowledges himſelf inferiour; is aſhamed and out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; pays mighty Deference and Reſpect to the Party apply'd to; and the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all his Behaviour is that beggerly Form, <hi>Your Petitioner, as in Duty bound,</hi> &amp;c. This is the very Ground of what I obſerv'd of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> it was the Pride of his Heart that made him ſay, after the Defeat of <hi>Pompey,</hi> That He never took ſo much Delight in any thing, as in being ſupplicated and ſought to; and, to gratifie his own Vanity in this particular, he gave All, even his Enemies, ſome Hopes of obtaining their Requeſts in time, that ſo he might drill them on to repeat and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their Applications to him. And what can we make of This? It was not out of any good Intentions to others, but meerly to pleaſe himſelf, that he ſhew'd himſelf exora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eaſie of Acceſs. For Kindneſs comes eaſie; and therefore as an Emblem of its doing ſo, the Graces of old were deſcribed and painted, with looſe, tranſparent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; not girt cloſe about their Bodies, but flowing and free; to ſhew, that Favours ſhould have nothing of Trick or Deſign, nothing ſtrait-lac'd, or of Conſtraint in them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A Third Qualification neceſſary to recommend any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is the conferring it readily, and out of Hand; This indeed ſeems to have ſome Connexion and Dependence upon the former. For all Kindneſſes are to be rated by the Good-Will and Diſpoſition of the Donor; And<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui tardè fecit, diu noluit.</note> He who delays his Relief, was ſo long in a State of Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to give it. And as that Loathneſs is a very great Rebate, ſo the ſpeedy Complyance and Alacrity of the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:53648:571"/>Mind is a great Enhancement, and doubles the Gift. That cold Indifferency, and thoſe trifling Put-off's, commonly practiſed upon ſuch Occaſions, are approv'd by no Body but Men of Inſolence, who make it their Diverſion to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and abuſe People: For Diligence and Diſpatch are commendable in all Caſes, and in none more requiſite than in This now before us. There are Five different Methods of proceeding in it; Three of which are liable to Cenſure, and the other Two as worthy of Commendation. A Man may deny, but he may keep one in ſuſpenſe and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great while firſt; This is a double Injury. He may refuſe immediately, or he may grant at laſt; and both theſe amount much to one, when the Matter comes to be fairly computed; at leaſt,<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Minus decipitur, cui negatur celeriter.</note> 
                                 <hi>He that is ſoon ſaid Nay, is leſs deceiv'd.</hi> The Fourth is to grant ſpeedily; and This is very well: But the Beſt of all is, To prevent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; to foreſee Men's Wants and Wiſhes, and never put them to the Expence of asking at all.</p>
                              <p>A Fourth Commendation is the Giving without any proſpect of a Requital; and indeed This is the very thing, wherein the Virtue of Beneficence chiefly conſiſts; for when once you make it mercenary, it ceaſes to be a Virtue.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tunc eſt Virtus dare Beneficia non reditura.</note> There is a great deal leſs Kindneſs where there are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations cheriſh'd of the Benefit reflecting back again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Mover. But when there is no Opportunity, no Poſſibility of a Return; nay, when Matters are carry'd ſo privately, that the Party oblig'd does not ſo much as know his Benefactor, then the Benefit ſhines in its full Luſtre. If a Man ſtudy the Point of Retaliation, he will give but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by Peace-meals; becauſe this is the thrifty way of being as little out of Pocket as he can. Now it were much better to renounce all Thoughts of being paid again, than to be ſlack in doing good; becauſe by coveting this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which is accidental only, and foreign to the purpoſe, he loſes that which is the true and natural Recompence, the inward Complacency of Mind, and the raviſhing Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which reſult from a Senſe of doing good. A Man ſhould not need to be twice intreated for the ſame thing. For, as the being guilty of Injuſtice is of it ſelf abominable and baſe, and there needs no other Conſideration, than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and Obliquity of the Thing to defer us from it; ſo
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:53648:571"/>the doing Good is a generous and becoming Act, and it is a Fault to want any other Motive, more than its Native Beauty and Excellence; the ſtaying till we are argu'd and importun'd into Matters of this Nature, betrays either much Ignorance, or great Indifference. In a Word,<note n="†" place="bottom">Non eſt Beneficium quod in quaeſtum mittitur.</note> To keep one's Eye upon the Return, and the Account our Kindneſs is like to turn to, is not properly doing good with our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but turning the Penny, and putting it out to Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; Theſe are Methods too diſtant to be reconcil'd, and confounded together; and<note n="⁂" place="bottom">Demus Beneficium, non foeneremus. Dignus eſt decipi, qui de recipiendo cogitavit, cum daret.</note> we ſhould always diſtinguiſh between Giving, and driving ſuch a Trade. Such Men are right enough ſerv'd, when their Expectations are diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As That Woman muſt not pretend to Honour and Virtue, who denies her Lover, only to inflame his Paſſion the more, and in hopes that he will renew his Courtſhip; ſo That Man muſt not think to paſs for Liberal and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, who ſends away his Petitioner to Day, that he may ſee him again to morrow, or expends that which he hopes will ſhortly come home to him. For this Reaſon <hi>Heſiod,</hi> and the old Poets, deſcrib'd the Graces in a State of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity; that no Man when he does good Offices, ſhould have regard to multiplying and increaſe. And eſpecially this falls infinitely ſhort of a Chriſtian's Virtue, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath poſitively commanded him, upon theſe Occaſions, to hope for nothing again, to look at no other Recompence than that diſtant and future one, reſerv'd for him by his Paymaſter in Heaven; and hath deſcrib'd the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Publicans, the moſt ignorant and moſt ſcandalous ſort of Men by this Character, that even They will give and lend to thoſe, from whom they have any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving as much again.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Another Rule is, To oblige Men in their own way, ſo as may be moſt to the ſatisfaction of the Receiver; for this convinces him, that what we do of this kind, is entirely for his Sake and Service. And here we ſhall do well to take notice, that there are two ſorts of good Offices. Some are ſuch, as derive Credit and Honour upon the Receiver, and theſe ſhould be contriv'd in as publick a manner as poſſible; Others tend to his Profit only; they ſupply his Wants, or ſupport his Weakneſs, or cover his Shame, or aſſiſt him in
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:53648:572"/>ſome other Neceſſity or Diſtreſs. And theſe ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd with all the Privacy imaginable; ſo much that, if it be poſſible, none but the Perſon himſelf ſhould know it: Nay, if that can any way ſerve his Intereſt, or be more acceptable to him, it will be very fit and prudent to keep Him in Ignorance too; to let the Kindneſs drop into his Mouth, and convey it to him under-hand. For many times a Man's Circumſtances require a Relief, which he is out of Countenance to accept; and there is a Tenderneſs due to the Modeſty of Perſons reduc'd by Afflictions and Caſualties, who cannot change their Souls with their Fortunes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that all divulging of Kindneſs is perfectly uſeleſs to one that does it upon a true Principle; for a Man's own Conſcience cannot poſſibly be ignorant of his Merit, and this ſingle Witneſs is as good as Ten thouſand others.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> It muſt likewiſe be done without the Detriment or juſt Offence of any other Perſon whatſoever; but eſpecially without the leaſt Violation of Equity and Juſtice. For a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any tolerable Senſe be ſaid to do good, when he does ill at the ſame time; Thoſe that want our Relief ought to have it; but we muſt not relieve Them at other People's Expence. What the Wiſe Man ſays of the Hypocrite's Piety is every whit as true of his Liberality and Charity,<note place="margin">Eccluſ. xxxiv. 18, 20.</note> 
                                 <hi>He that ſacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his Offering is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and He is as one that killeth the Son before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eyes.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> A Seventh Qualification is, To do it prudently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately. A Man is ſometimes very hard put to it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer People's Requeſts, and at a loſs, either how to grant, or how to refuſe them. This is a Difficulty owing to a very ill Diſpoſition common to moſt Men, but moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in thoſe that make the Requeſts; which inclines them to reſent a Denial, tho' never ſo reaſonable in its ſelf, and never ſo tenderly expreſt. Some by this means are driven to a very poor, and indeed a very diſhoneſt Refuge; which is, To promiſe every thing to every Body, tho' they are ſenſible oftentimes, that it is not in their power; and, which is ſtill worſe, conſcious to themſelves, that it never was in their Intention to make it good; but, all this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſhift off the Difficulty, till it comes to the very Point of Performance; and truſt to ſome Accident or other, to bring them off, by making ſuch an Alteration in their Affairs, that the Obligation ſhall ceaſe: Or elſe, if it be ſtill expected, that they ſhould ſtand by their Engagements,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:53648:572"/>ſome paltry Evaſions are laid hold of in their Excuſe: But ſtill the Evil Day is put far from them; and the Suitor's Mouth is ſtopp'd for the preſent. Now All this is quite wrong, and a miſerable Inſtance of Human Frailty; for no Man ought to promiſe, or encourage the Expectation of any thing which he either is not able, or may not lawfully, or does not really and ſincerely deſign, to make good to the uttermoſt. And when he finds himſelf at a Bay, enclos'd between theſe two Difficulties, of making a Promiſe, which is either unjuſt, or inexpedient, or diſhonourable and unbecoming his Character to fulfil; or elſe of giving a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, which is ſure to be ill taken, and breed Miſchief and Diſcontent; the beſt Courſe to extricate himſelf, is to break, to evade the Blow; either by declining a poſitive Anſwer, or elſe by wording his Promiſe ſo cautiouſly, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſions of Civility and good Inclination, that the Perſon may have nothing of a punctual Engagement to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon. There is, I confeſs, ſomewhat of Management and Cunning in doing ſo, which may make this Advice ſeem ſtrange and inconſiſtent, with that Frankeſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Sincerity in Converſation, which I have been lately recommending; but we are to conſider this as a Caſe of Neceſſity, that when Men will be unreaſonable, we muſt deal with them as we can; and that they deſerve at leaſt to be thus treated.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> An Eighth neceſſary Ingredient is, That all Things of this Kind be done with a true Spirit of Humanity, and ſincere Affection; for ſuch a Temper will be very ſenſibly concern'd for the Benefit of all Mankind; but more particularly it will bear a very tender regard to the Miſeries of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Afflicted; which is a Virtue more particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd by the Name of Mercy and Pity. Thoſe who want theſe Bowels, are Irregularities and Deviations from Nature, and ſo diſtant from Grace and Goodneſs, that the Apoſtle reckons This, as one of the Characters of the laſt and worſt Times. But then the Compaſſion I mean here, is a Brave, and Maſculine, and Generous Quality; not a Softneſs and Effeminacy of Soul, which melts into Tears, and creates Perplexity and Diſorder of Thought. For This is a faulty Paſſion, ſuch as weak and wicked People are capable of falling under; concerning which I have already made ſome Remarks in its proper Place; and demonſtrated, that there is a criminal and fooliſh Pity, as well as a wiſe, well-govern'd, and commendable one. We ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:53648:573"/>to ſuccour the Afflicted; but we muſt not afflict our ſelves for them, nor make their Miſeries our own. This were unprofitable to Them, and greatly prejudicial to Us; nor may we ſtrain a Point of Decency or Duty upon their Account; for Charity cannot diſpenſe with Juſtice, nor ſet aſide our other Obligations. God himſelf hath poſitively forbidden us to favour a Poor Man in his Cauſe. And God Himſelf and the Saints are ſaid to be Pitiful and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſienate; but yet not ſo, as to give any Diſturbance to the Perfection of their own Happineſs; any more than to impair the Perfection of their Holineſs; in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods made uſe of for the ſuccour of thoſe they do pity.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> A Ninth Rule is, to avoid Boaſting of our Kindneſs, and all manner of unneceſſary Publication of it. This is a ſort of Upbraiding and Reproach; it cancels the Obligation quite, and is the moſt invidious way of making Men our Enemies; by turning our Favours into Provocations; and therefore it is very well obſerv'd to this purpoſe, That he who receives a good Turn, ſhould never forget it; but he who does one, ſhould never remember it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> A Tenth is, To proceed, and not be weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, but keep our old Favours always freſh, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new one's. This will be a powerful Charm to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Affection of all the World, and make Men ambitious of our Friendſhip. Nor ſhould a Man ever repent of his paſt Obligations, tho' ſenſible, that he hath had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſcatter his Seed in a barren and ungrateful Soil.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beneficii tui etiam infoelicitas placeat: nuſquam hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>Let even the Miſcarriage of your Kindneſs give you Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (ſays the Philoſopher) <hi>and let not any ſuch Expreſſion eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape you, as, I wiſh I had never done ſo;</hi> For indeed there can be no juſt Foundation for grudging our Kindneſs. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Wretch injures no Body but himſelf; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that was miſplaced, is not utterly loſt or thrown away, it is devoted to a Holy and Excellent uſe, and cannot be deſtroy'd or profan'd by the Receiver's Fault. If another will needs be wicked, and act otherwiſe than becomes him, this can never juſtifie my ceaſing to be good. But further, The generous and noble Spirit diſtinguiſhes it ſelf by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; and triumphs in the Conqueſt of Ingratitude and Ill-nature, when invincible Beneficence hath heaped Coals
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:53648:573"/>of Fire upon their Heads, melted them down, and ſoftned them into good Temper, and a better Senſe of Things. So ſays the Moraliſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Optimi &amp; ingentis animi eſt tamdiu ferre ingratum, donec feceris gratum; vincit malos pertinax Bonitas.</note> 
                                 <hi>A Great Soul bears the ingrateful Man ſo long, till at laſt he makes him grateful; for obſtinate and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Goodneſs will conquer the worſt of Men.</hi>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The Laſt Direction I ſhall lay down upon this Occaſion is, That when a thing is given, we ſhould let a Man uſe and enjoy it quietly, and not be troubleſome and unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with him; like ſome, who when they have put one into any Office or Preferment, will needs be thruſting in their Oar, and execute it for him: Or elſe procure a Man ſome conſiderable Advantage, and then make over what proportion of the Profits they ſee ſit, to themſelves. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers in ſuch Caſes ought not to endure the being thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon; and any Reſentments or Refuſals made upon this Account, are by no means the Marks of Ingratitude, but a preſervation of their own Rights. And whatever the Benefactor may have contributed to our Preferment, he wipes out the whole Score, and acquits us of all our Obligations, by theſe imperious and buſie Interpoſitions. The Story is not amiſs concerning one of the Popes, who being preſs'd hard by one of the Cardinals to do ſomewhat inconvenient, or perhaps unjuſt, in his Favour; and (as a Motive, which was thought irreſiſtible, or at leaſt a Reſentment which he look'd upon as reaſonable in caſe of refuſal) the Cardinal re-minding him that His Intereſt had been formerly at his Service, and his Popedom was owing to it; His Holineſs very pertinently reply'd, <hi>If You made me Pope, pray let me be ſo, and do not take back again the Authority you gave me.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> After theſe ſeveral Rules for the directing Men in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Beneficence, it may be ſeaſonable to obſerve, <note place="margin">Several ſorts of Kindneſſes.</note> that there are Benefits of ſeveral ſorts; ſome of them much more acceptable than others, and thus ſome more, and others leſs engaging. Thoſe are moſt welcome that come from the Hand of a Friend, and one whom we are ſtrongly diſpos'd to love, without any ſuch Inducement: As, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is very grievous and grating to be oblig'd by one, of whom we have no Opinion, and deſire of all things not to be indebted to. Thoſe are likewiſe ſo, which proceed from a Perſon whom we have formerly oblig'd our ſelves;
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:53648:574"/>becauſe This is not ſo much Gratuity, as Juſtice and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Arrears, and ſo draws very little or no new Debt upon us. Such again are thoſe done in a time of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when our Occaſions were very urgent: Theſe have a mighty Influence; they utterly deface all paſt Injuries and Miſunderſtandings, if any ſuch there were; and leave a ſtrong Tie upon a Man's Honour; as, on the other Hand, the denying our Aſſiſtance in Caſes of Extremity, is extremely unkind, and wipes out all Remembrances of any former Benefits. Such, once more, are Thoſe, that can be eaſily acknowledged, and admit of a ſuitable Return; as, on the contrary, ſuch as the Receiver is out of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to requite, commonly breed Hatred, and a ſecret Diſlike: For there is a Pride in moſt Men, that makes them uneaſie to be always behind-hand; and hence he who is ſenſible, that he can never make amends for all he hath receiv'd, every time that he ſees his Benefactor, fancies himſelf dogg'd by a Creditor, upbraided by a living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Inſufficiency or Ingratitude; and theſe ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his own Mind, give great Uneaſineſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; for no Bankrupt can bear being twitted with his Poverty. Some again there are, which the more free and honourable, and reſpectful they are, the more burdenſom and weighty they are; provided the Receiver be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Honour and Principle: Such, I mean, as bind the Conſciences and the Wills of Men; for they tie a Man up faſter, keep him more tight, and render him more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and fearful of failing, or forgetfulneſs. A Man is Ten times more a Priſoner, when confin'd by his own Word, than if he were under Lock and Key. It is eaſier to be bound by Legal and publick Reſtraints, and Forms of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, than by the Laws of Honour and Conſcience; and Two Notaries in this Caſe are better than One. When a Man ſays, <hi>I deſire nothing but your Word, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your Honeſty;</hi> ſuch a one indeed ſhews greater reſpect: But if he be ſure of his Man, he puts him upon a ſtricter Obligation, and himſelf upon better Security than Bonds and Judgments. A Man who engages nothing but his Word, is always in Fear and Conſtraint, and upon his Guard, leſt he ſhould forfeit or forget it. Your Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee, and he that is under the power of Legal Forms, is deliver'd from that Anxiety, and depends upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's Inſtruments, which will not ſail to refreſh his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, when the Bonds become due. Where there is any
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:53648:574"/>external Force, the Will is always leſs intent; and where the Conſtraint is leſs, there in proportion the Application of the Will is greater.<note n="*" place="bottom">Quod me Jus cogit, vix à Voluntate impetrem.</note>

Parents, and Princes, and all Superiours are bound in Duty, and by virtue of their Station, to procure the Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Thoſe, whom either the Laws and Order of Nature, or the political Conſtitutions of Government, or any other Law relating to their Poſt, have committed to their Inſpection and Care. And not only ſo, but All in general, whether their Character be Publick or not, if they have Wealth and Power, are by the Law of Nature oblig'd to extend their Help and Bounty towards the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous and Diſtreſs'd. And this is the firſt ſort of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But then from good Offices thus done, whether they be in ſome regard owing to us, as flowing from the Duty incumbent upon the Benefactor, by virtue of this former Engagement: Or whether they be the effect of pure Choice, entirely Grace, and nothing of Debt, there ariſes the Second ſort of Obligation, whereby the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are bound to acknowledge the Kindneſs, and to be thankful for it. All this mutual Exchange, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engagements and good Turns, <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by his Deſcription of the <hi>Graces,</hi> when he paints them Three in Number, and all joyning Hands.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> The Firſt, or Original Obligation is ſatisfy'd by the due Performance of thoſe particular Offices, <note place="margin">The firſt Original Obligation.</note> which each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's reſpective Station requires from him. And what theſe are, we ſhall very ſhortly take occaſion to explain at large, when the Special Duties, which make up the other Branch of Juſtice to our Neighbour, come to be conſider'd. In the mean while, I deſire my Reader to obſerve, that the Primitive Engagement we are treating of at preſent, tho' it cannot be utterly diſſolv'd, yet it may be tied fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and cloſer, or ſlacken and ſit more looſe upon us, by ſeveral accidental Circumſtances; and particularly, it may
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:53648:575"/>be mightily ſtrengthened, or diminiſhed, by the Conditions and Behaviour of thoſe we have to deal with. If the very Relation of a Subject or a Child bind us to them, the Affectionate and Dutiful Carriage of good Subjects, and good Children, enforce the Obligations of Kindneſs yet more. And ſo again; Their Miſdemeanours, their Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, their Inſolence and Unworthy Behaviour, do in a great Meaſure diſcharge us of that Tenderneſs and Care, which they have otherwiſe a Right to expect from us. And I cannot tell, whether this Obſervation may not hold in ſome Degree, with Regard to Natural Defects alſo. A Man may; perhaps indeed he cannot but, have leſs Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a Child, or a Kinſman, or a Servant, not only if he be Ill-tempered and Perverſe; but if he be deformed, or crooked, or unfortunate in his Perſon. For God, who made Beauty an attractive Excellence, ſeems himſelf to have lowered the Natural Value ſuch Perſons are to be rated at. But then, whatever Influence this Conſideration may have upon our Minds and Inclinations, it muſt have none at all upon the outward Adminiſtration of our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Theſe unhappy Perſons have the ſame Title to our Juſtice and Charity; their Neceſſities put in the ſame common Claim to our Aſſiſtance and Relief; and all the Good we are engaged to upon any publick and general Account, is ſtill to be Punctually performed towards them; and indeed the leſs to be neglected, becauſe, thoſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defects are their Misfortunes only, not their Faults; and as ſuch ſhould excite our Pity to ſupply the Place of Inclination.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> But that Obligation, <note place="margin">The Second Eligation.</note> which lies before us at preſent, is the Second Sort; ſuch as ariſes from Benefits received: And for our better Direction in this Matter, we ſhall do well to obſerve.</p>
                              <p>Firſt of all; That the Laws of Acknowledgment and grateful Returns are Natural and Univerſal; They are not confined to Humanity alone, but even Brutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have a Senſe of, and ſhare in them. Nay, and thoſe too, not only tame, and manageable, and Domeſtick Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which might tempt us to think this Diſpoſition the Effect of Art or Cuſtom; but even the Wildeſt and moſt Savage Creatures: For in them we meet with ſeveral no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Inſtances of Gratitude; One Example whereof I have formerly mention'd, in the Behaviour of a Lyon, to that
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53648:575"/>
                                 <hi>Roman</hi> Slave,<note place="margin">Book I. Chap. 8. Sect. 12.</note> who was expoſed in the Theatre to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by him.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly.</hi> It is a Virtuous Act, and a certain Indication of a good Mind; for which Reaſon it is really more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, than Beneficence it ſelf: For Liberality often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Plenty, or Power; Regard to one's own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Reputation, and not very often from pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; But Gratitude cannot ſpring from any other Cauſe than an ingenuous Diſpoſition. And therefore, though the doing of good Offices may be the more deſirable, yet the grateful Acknowledgment, and ſtudying to requite them, when they are done, is the more Commendable of the Two.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Gratitude is likewiſe an eaſie and a pleaſant Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and yet ſuch as no body can be excuſed from, upon the Pretence of Diſability, or Want of Opportunity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is always in our own Diſpoſal, always preſent with us. Now, nothing is ſo eaſie, as to obey and follow the Dictates of Nature; and nothing ſo Pleaſant and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, as for a Man to acquit himſelf of Obligations, to come out of Debt, and ſet himſelf Free, and upon the Level with his Neighbours.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> From all that hath been ſaid upon this Subject, we cannot but diſcern, how much of Baſeneſs, and Meanneſs of Spirit, the Vices of Ingratitude and Neglect carry with them; how deſervedly Odious they are to all the World.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dixeris Maledicta cuncta, cum ingratum hominem dixeris.

                                 <hi>To call a Man Ingrateful, is the worſt and blackeſt Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you can lay to his Charge.</hi> It is an Offence againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a certain Indication of an ill Temper; a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and reproachful Vice; ſuch as is not to be endured, becauſe it breaks all Society and good Correſpondence. The Revenge, which follows upon an Injury, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude which follows a Kindneſs, are both Bad and Blameable, but not equally ſo. Revenge is indeed the ſtronger and more violent Paſſion; but it hath leſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Degeneracy of Soul, than Ingratitude. The Evils and Diſeaſes of our Minds are like thoſe incident to our Bodies; where thoſe that are moſt Dangerous and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal are not always the moſt Painful and Acute. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Revenge may diſorder a Man more, but Ingratitude corrupts his Virtue more. In the Former there is ſome
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:53648:576"/>Appearance of Juſtice, Men are not aſhamed to purſue and own that publickly; but the latter is all over Infamy and Baſeneſs, and no Man was ever yet ſo abandoned or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to confeſs or glory in it.</p>

                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Man muſt receive the Kindneſſes done to him, cheerfully and friendly; he muſt look, and expreſs himſelf well pleaſed with them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui gratù Beneficium accepit, primam ejus Penſionem ſolvit.</note>

                                 <hi>He that forgets his Benefactor, is of all others the fartheſt from Gratitude; for how is it poſſible a Man ſhould diſcharge this Duty, who hath ſuffered the Foundation of it to ſlip quite from under him?

And that our Memory upon this occaſion may never want Refreſhing, it will be Decent to mention the Advantage we have receiv'd, by the Title of his Gifts, who conferred it upon us. The <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> is, to make a Return, and Reſtitution, wherein we may govern our ſelves according to theſe Four Rules.

                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> IN Regard the Perſons under this Condition may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in different Reſpects, according to that Mixture of Equality and Inequality, which I have obſerved to be in their Circumſtances, it muſt needs follow, that the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties peculiar to ſuch a State, are of Two Sorts; Some common to both, and Others appropriated to each of the Parties. Now, of thoſe that are reciprocal, the Obligation is entirely the ſame; and the Conſciences of both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually violated by the Breach of them; though, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtoms of the World, the Penalty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and Inconvenience fall more Heavy on one ſide, than they do on the other. By theſe reciprocal Duties, I underſtand, an Entire Affection, ſteady Loyalty, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Fidelity, and unreſerved Communication of all things whatſoever; ſo that Neither of them have any thing they can call their own, excluſive to the Right and Claim of the Other. To theſe we may add a prudent, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Care, and the Exerciſe of a juſt Authority over their Family, a diligent Inſpection into their Manners, and conſulting the Advantage of all that belong to them.<note place="margin">Book. I. Chap. 42.</note> Of this Subject we have ſpoken more at large in the firſt Firſt Part of this Treatiſe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Other ſort are Duties Peculiar to each of the Parties; and Theſe differ, <note place="margin">Husband's Duty.</note> according to the Terms of that une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Relation, in which they ſtand. For, thoſe of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, conſidered as Superiour, are. 1. Inſtructing his Wife, conferring with, and directing her in every Particular, that may any way contribute to their Honour and Advantage; taking Care, that ſhe may be Ignorant in no Part of the Duty expected from her Character, nor defective in any uſeful and neceſſary Accompliſhments, which ſhe is capable of attaining to; and all this to be done not in a Rough and Magiſterial Way; but with all poſſible Gentleneſs and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:53648:578"/>Sweetneſs, in the ſofteſt and moſt engaging manner, with the Tenderneſs of a Parent, and the reſpectful Affection of a Friend. 2. The maintaining her as his Wife; as befits One, whom he hath made the ſame with himſelf; and therefore without any Regard to her former Circumſtances. Whether ſhe did, or did not bring a Fortune, That alters not the Caſe one whit; ſuch Conſiderations are quite out of Doors, and nothing now lies before him, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Relation between them. He is indeed to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Abilities, and will do well to ſecure the main Chance; but then all the Frugality upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt extend to the retrenching his own Expences too: For whatever Figure he allows himſelf to make; his Wife ought to be ſupported Suitably and in Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it. 3. The providing her with Clothes, which is a Right ſo undoubted, that all Laws concur in giving a Wife this Privilege; and that in ſo Solemn and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable a manner, that they have denied the Husband a Power, of diſpoſing any thing of this Kind away from her; and have not left them liable to the Payment of his juſt Debts. 4. The Rights of the Bed. 5. The Loving, Cheriſhing, and Protecting her. Thoſe Two Extremes, which the World are apt to run into, are Vicious and Abominable. The keeping them under, and treating them like Servants; and the ſubmitting to them as if they were abſolute Miſtreſſes. Theſe I take to be the principal and conſtant Duties. Others there are, Accidental, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Duties, ſecondary to, and conſequent upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Such as, Taking Care of her, if ſhe be ſick; Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming her, if ſhe be taken Captive; Burying her Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and according to her Quality, if ſhe happen to die; and Making Proviſion by his laſt Will, for her decent Support in her Widowhood, and the comfortable Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Children ſhe hath brought him.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Duties of the Wife are to pay all becoming Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Reverence, and Reſpect to her Husband; <note place="margin">Wive's Duty.</note> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, as a kind and Affectionate Maſter. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Scripture takes Notice, that Women emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Conjugal Virtues, uſed to call their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands <hi>Lord;</hi> and it is obſervable, that the ſame Word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, ſignifies <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Husband</hi> both.</p>
                              <p>The Imagination, that a Woman leſſens her ſelf by this reſpectful and ſubmiſſive Behaviour, is moſt Frivolous and Fooliſh; for ſhe that diſcharges this part of her Duty well,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:53648:579"/>conſults her own, more than her Husband's Honour; and ſhe that is Inſolent and Imperious, Humourſome and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, does the greateſt Injury to her ſelf. A Second Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is Obedience to all his lawful and juſt Command's, complying with his Humours, and bringing over her own Inclinations to His: For a good and a prudent Wife, is like a true Glaſs, which makes an exact Reflection of the Face that looks in it. She ſhould have no Deſign, no Paſſion, no Thought particular to her ſelf; but to be ſure, none in Oppoſition to His. Like Dimenſions and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which have no Motion, no ſeparate Exiſtence of their own, but conſtantly move with, and ſubſiſt in the Body whereunto they belong; ſo Wives ſhould always keep cloſe, and be from the very Heart, and even Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Souls, entirely, and inſeparably united to their Husbands. A Third is Service, That part eſpecially, which relates to the providing him ſeaſonable and Neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, over-looking the Kitchin, ordering the Table, and not diſdaining to do any Offices, or give him any kind of Aſſiſtance about his Perſon; a Duty ſo fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to, that the Antients were wont to reckon Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Feet in particular, among the Inſtances of Service, due from the Wife to her Husband. <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Keeping much at Home, upon which Account a Wife is compar'd to a Tortoiſe, that carries her Houſe upon her Back; and uſed heretofore to be painted with her Feet Naked, an Emblem of her not being provided for ſtirring abroad. This is a modeſt and decent Reſerve, requiſite at all Times, but more eſpecially in the Abſence of her Husband. For a good Wife is the exact Reverſe of the Moon; ſhe ſhines abroad and in full Luſtre, when near her Sun; but diſappears, and is totally inviſible, when at a Diſtance from him. A <hi>Fifth</hi> is Silence; for ſhe ſhould never give her ſelf the Liberty of talking much, except with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or for him; Here indeed her Tongue may take a Looſe, and is ſubject to no other Reſtraint, than the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more, than is convenient. This, I confeſs, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult Point, hard of Digeſtion in this laviſh Age; where Multitude of Words ſets up for a Female Virtue; and ſo rare in all Ages,<note place="margin">Eccluſ. xxvi. 14.</note> that the Wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> calls a ſilent Woman a Precious and Particular Gift of God. The <hi>Sixth</hi> is applying her ſelf to Houſwifery and good Management;<note place="margin">Prov. xxxi.</note> for though <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Deſcription of a wiſe and good Woman may be thought too Mean and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:53648:579"/>Mechanical for this refined Generation, yet certain it is, that the Buſineſs of a Family is the moſt Profitable, nay, the moſt Honourable Study they can employ themſelves in.

                                 </gap> the Truth, This is a Fortune ſingly, and by it ſelf; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or the Neglect of it, without the Addition of any Caſualties, is ſufficient to ruine, or to preſerve, nay, to make a Family. But This hath the Fate of all other Excellencies too, which is to be exceeding rare and ſcarce. There are, I confeſs, a great many ſordid and ſcraping Wives, but very few good Managers. But alas! there is a vaſt deal of Difference between Avarice and Parſimony, and provident Care and good Houſwifery.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As to the Enjoyments indulged in a Married State; Men ſhould always remember, that this is a Chaſt, a Pure, and a Religious Union; Conſecrated to Excellent Myſteries, and Holy Purpoſes; and therefore, that all the Pleaſures of it ſhould be uſed with Moderation and Sobriety: In ſuch Meaſures only, as Prudence and Conſcience would direct, when conſulted ſeriouſly, and without any Byaſs from groſs and carnal Affections. And ſure it would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill become a Society inſtituted for mutual Comfort, and the Advancement of Religion, and the preſervation of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to throw off all Reſtraint; and convert their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Lawful Delights, into an Occaſion of abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to Senſuality and Licentiouſneſs. This is One of thoſe Caſes, where no certain Bounds can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; but it will highly concern all Perſons engaged in this State, to conſider the Dignity and the Deſign of it, and to keep themſelves under ſuch Reſerves, as may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profane the one, nor evacuate the other.</p>

                                 <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Good Management.</head>
                              <p>THis is a very becoming and neceſſary Care. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, not hard to be attained to; every Man of common Diſcretion is capable of it. But, though the Art be eaſily learned, the conſtant Exerciſe of it is Intricate and Laborious; by Reaſon of that Great Variety of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, in which it engages us; and, though many Matters about which it is managed, be ſmall and inconſiderable in themſelves; yet the conſtant Succeſſion of them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſome. Domeſtick Cares give great Uneaſineſs, becauſe they allow of no Intermiſſion; but, if the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are occaſion'd by the principal Perſons in the Family, they fret, and gall, and wrankle inward, and ſcarce admit of any Reſt or Remedy.</p>
                              <p>The Beſt Method of rendring this Care eaſie and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, is, To procure ſome faithful Servants, in whoſe Honeſty we can have entire Confidence, and Security. To buy in Proviſions in their proper Seaſons, and wait for the beſt Markets; To prevent all unneceſſary Waſte, which is the Province, proper to the Miſtreſs of the Houſe. To make Neceſſity, and Cleanlineſs, and Order, our firſt Care; and when Theſe are ſerved, if our Circumſtances will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend farther, then to provide for Plenty, and Shew, and Niceneſs; a gentile Appearance, and every Thing faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in it's Kind. To regulate our Expences, by cutting off our Superfluous Charge; yet ſo, as to have a Regard to Decency and Convenience, and grudge Nothing, which either Neceſſity or Duty call for from us. One Shilling ſaved, with theſe Limitations, will do us more Credit, than Ten idly ſquandered away. But to the avoiding Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we ſhould alſo add the other commendable Quality, of good Contrivance; for it is a Mark of great Addreſs, when we can make our Peny go a great Way, and appear Handſomely with little Charge: But above all things, a Man muſt be ſure to keep within Compaſs, and ſute his way of Living to his preſent Circumſtances: For the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Proſpects, are ſtill but Futurities; and, as ſuch, they muſt needs be uncertain; ſo that there cannot be a more
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:53648:580"/>ridiculous Folly, than to ſpend high in Confidence of Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and diſtant Expectations.</p>
                              <p>A Maſter's Eye muſt be every where; and if either He or the Miſtreſs be ignorant and unexperienced in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, they muſt take Care to conceal this Infirmity, and pretend at leaſt to underſtand all that belongs to them. But eſpecially, they muſt never appear Negligent or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, but put on an Air of Diligence and Concern how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For, if once the Servants get a Notion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Careleſs, how their Affairs are managed, they will not fail to take their Advantage, and in a ſhort Time, leave them little or nothing to take Care of.</p>

                                 <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The Duty of Parents and Children.</head>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE Duty of Parents and Children is Reciprocal, and Natural on both ſides; Thus far they both agree. But, if the Obligation be ſomewhat ſtricter on the Child's Part, that Difference is compenſated by being more Ancient on the Parents ſide: For Parents are the Authors, and firſt Cauſe; and, of the Two, of much greater Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Publick. The Peopling the World with Good Men and Good Patriots, is their Work; the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Inſtruction of Youth is the only Method of effecting it, ſo that here the firſt Seeds of Political Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inſtitutions are firſt laid. And, of the Two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, That is much leſs, which the State ſuffers from the Diſobedience and Ingratitude of Children toward their Parents, than from the Remiſneſs and Neglect Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are guilty of toward their Children. Hence, in the <hi>Lacedoemonian,</hi> and ſome other very wiſe Governments, there were Mulcts and other Penalties inflicted upon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when their Children prov'd Perverſe and Ill-temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And <hi>Plato</hi> declared, he knew no one Inſtance, that needed a Man's Care more, or deſerved it better, than the endeavouring to make a good Son. And <hi>Crates</hi> in great Wrath expoſtulated thus with his Country-men. <q>To what Purpoſe is all this Pains to heap up great Eſtates, while it is no part of your Concern what manner of Heirs you leave them to? This is like a Man's being
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:53648:581"/>Nice of his Shooe, and Negligent of his Foot. What ſhould a Man do with Riches, who hath not the Senſe, nor the Hert to make a good Uſe of them? This is like an embroidered Saddle, and ſumptuous Furniture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Jaded Horſe.</q> Parents indeed are doubly obliged to the Performance of this Duty. In Kindneſs to themſelves; as they are their own Offspring; and in Regard to the Publick, becauſe theſe young Suckers are the Hopes of the Tree, the promiſing Shoots, upon the thriving and kindly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating whereof, the Strength and Succeſſion of the Body Politick depends. So that this is, killing Two Birds with One Stone, ſerving one's own private Intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Welfare and Honour of one's Country, at the ſame time.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now, this Duty conſiſts of Four Parts; each of which ſucceed in order to the other; and theſe are proportion'd to the Four Advantages which Children ought to receive from their Parents in their proper Seaſons. Life, and Nouriſhment, Inſtruction, and partaking of the Advantages of Life with them. The <hi>Firſt</hi> reſpects the Time of a Child's Exiſtence, till his Birth incluſively; The <hi>Second</hi> his Infancy; The <hi>Third</hi> his Youth, and the <hi>Laſt</hi> his riper Age.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Concerning the <hi>Firſt</hi> of Theſe I ſhall only ſay, that though it be very little attended to, yet is it of mighty Conſequence, and of ſtrict Obligation: For no Man, who hath any the leaſt Inſight into Nature, can be ignorant, how hereditary Conſtitutions and Complexions are: And therefore we may be good or ill Parents, even before our Children are born. And I am ſure, among other Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the care of Health, and a regular Way of living, This ought not to be the leaſt, that Thoſe who derive their Being from us, do depend upon this Care for a great part of their Happineſs; For by what hath been largely diſcourſed in the firſt Book, it may plainly appear, that the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Turn of Men's Minds, and the Soundneſs and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of their Bodies, are in great Meaſure owing to a Parents good Conſtitution. And certainly, To Men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſcience, it ſhould be an Eternal Sting and Reproach, to reflect what Rottenneſs and Diſeaſes, they entail upon their Poſterity, by abandoning themſelves to Lewdneſs and Debauchery; how dearly thoſe Innocents pay for their Anceſtor's Exceſſes, and what a Barbarity it is to ſend poor Wretches into the World, to languith out a Life of Miſery and Pain, and ſuffer for Sins, which they never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:53648:581"/>So Neceſſary, ſo Important a Virtue is Temperance to Succeſſions and Families, as well as to Mens own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: So Miſchievous is Vice, and ſo Subtilly does it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate its diſmal Effects, even to thoſe that are yet unborn.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>Second</hi> of theſe Heads I leave to Phyſicians and Nurſes; and having thus briefly diſpatch'd the Two Firſt, becauſe ſomewhat foreign to our preſent Deſign, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be mention'd, only for the rendring this Diviſion compleat, I ſhall proceed to the <hi>Third,</hi> which concerns the Inſtructing of them, and is a Subject more worthy our ſerious Conſideration.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> So ſoon as the Child begins to move his Soul; and the Faculties of That, as well as the Organs of his Body ſhew that he is a Rational, and not only a Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Great Application ſhould be uſed to form him well at firſt. And this Care may be allowed to take Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four or Five Years Old, for by that time The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Imagination, and ſome little Strokes of Reaſon begin to dawn and diſplay themſelves. It is not to be imagined, of what conſequence theſe firſt Tinctures and Impreſſions are to the following part of Life; and what wonderful Efficacy and Influence they have, even to the changing and conquering Nature it ſelf: For Education is frequently obſerved to be Stronger than Natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; either for the bettering or corrupting of the Man. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made People ſenſible of this, by taking Two Whelps of the ſame Litter, which he had brought up dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ways, and in the Preſence of a great Company, ſetting before them Broth and a young Leveret; The Dog which had been brought up tenderly, and within Doors, fell to the Broth; but the Other, which had been uſed to range and hunt, neglected his Meat, and purſued his Game.</p>
                              <p>Now that which renders ſuch Inſtructions ſo marvellouſly powerful, is, that they are taken in very eaſily, and as hardly loſt again: For that which comes firſt, takes abſolute Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and carries all the Authority you can deſire; there being no Antecedent Notions to diſpute the Title, or call the Truth of it in Queſtion. While therefore the Soul is freſh and clear, a fair and perfect Blank, flexible and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there can be no Difficulty in making it what you pleaſe; for this Condition diſpoſes it to receive any manner of Impreſſion, and to be moulded into any manner of Form.</p>
                              <pb n="566" facs="tcp:53648:582"/>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now, the laying theſe firſt Foundations is no ſuch trivial Matter as is generally believed; rather indeed the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of doing it well, is proportionable to the Importance of its being done ſo. Nay, not of private only, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and general Importance; which makes me think the Complaint of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> moſt juſt, though there is little or no Care taken to redreſs it, when they cryed out Loudly againſt the Education of Children being left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Mercy and Diſpoſal of Parents, as a moſt notorious, deplorable, and deſtructive Injury to the State. For why ſhould This reſt wholly upon Perſons, who are ſo often found to be Careleſs, or Ignorant, or Indiſcreet, and by no Means ſit to govern themſelves? Why ſhould not the Publick concern themſelves in the Thing, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome better Care to be taken of it, rather than ſuffer what they Daily do, by ſitting ſtill and ſeeing their own Ruin? <hi>Lacedamon</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> are almoſt the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, where the diſciplining of Children hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by National Laws. And <hi>Sparta</hi> was indeed the beſt School in the World; which made <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> perſuade <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> to ſend his Children thither, becauſe there they would be ſure to be inſtructed in the Beſt and Nobleſt Science; that of Governing, and of Obeying well; and becauſe this was the Work-houſe, where they made admirable Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, Generals, Civil Magiſtrates, and Private Subjects. They ſeem'd indeed to be more intent upon the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Youth, and to lay greater Streſs upon it, than upon any other Thing whatſoever. Inſomuch that when <hi>Antipater</hi> demanded Fifty Children for Hoſtages, they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That they did not care to part with any at that Age, and had much rather give him twice as many grown Men.</p>

<pb n="567" facs="tcp:53648:582"/>being drawn from the Motions of Minds ſo very Young; the beſt courſe will be, to poſſeſs them with ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as may be univerſally Good, and of general Uſe at firſt; and when they are ſeaſoned well with theſe, That will prove a moſt excellent Preparation, for their taking to any particular Employment afterwards.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To proceed now on, to the Matter it ſelf; which may very conveniently be reduced to three Heads; The Forming of the Mind, Managing the Body, and Regulating of the Manners. But I muſt once more beg my Reader's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for another Digreſſion, (if it deſerve to be thought ſo) ſince, before I proceed to conſider theſe Particulars, it ſeems to me highly Expedient, to lay down ſome General Rules relating to this Matter, which may direct us how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, with Diſcretion and Succeſs.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The firſt of theſe Directions is, To keep this little White Soul from the Contagion and Corruption ſo univerſal among Men, that it may contract no Blemiſh, no Taint at its firſt coming abroad into the World. In order hereunto ſtrict Centry muſt be kep at the Doors; I mean the Eyes, and eſpecially the Ears, muſt be diligently guarded, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Thing get Admittance there. Now, This is done by taking Care of thoſe that are about the Child, and not ſuffering any, even of his Relations to come near him; whoſe Converſation is ſo laviſh and diſſolute, that we have Reaſon to fear they may convey any ill Idea's into him, though never ſo little, never ſo ſecretly: For One ſingle Word, One diſtant Hint, is ſufficient to do more Miſchief in a Child, than a great deal of Pains will be able to root out, or retrieve again. Upon this Account it was, that <hi>Plato</hi> would never endure, that Children ſhould be left to Servants, or entertained with their Stories: For if they talk nothing worſe, yet the beſt we can expect from them is idle Tales and ridiculous Fictions, which take ſuch deep Root in this tender Soil, that I verily believe a very great Part of the Vulgar Errours and Idle Prejudices moſt Men are poſſeſt with, is owing to the Giants, and Hobgoblins, and the reſt of that ridiculous Stuff, which they were kept in awe, or diverted with, in their very Infancy.</p>
                              <pb n="568" facs="tcp:53648:583"/>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The Second Direction concerns the Perſons to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with this Child; what they are, what Diſcourſe they have with him, what Books they put into his Hands. As to the Perſons themſelves; They ſhould be Men of Honeſty and Virtue, of a good Temper, and winning Behaviour; Men whoſe Heads lie well; and eminent, rather for Wiſdom, than Learning. They muſt alſo keep a good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together, and perfectly underſtand each other's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; for fear, while they take contrary Ways, (as if one would gain upon his Charge by Fear, and another by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery) they ſhould happen to croſs and hinder one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; confound the Child, perplex the Deſign, and be perpetually doing and undoing. The Books and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe intended for his Entertainment, ſhould by no Means be ſuch as treat of mean and triſting, frivolous and idle Subjects; but Great, and Serious, and Noble; ſuch as may help to enrich his Underſtanding, to direct his Opinions, to regulate his Manners and Affections. Such particularly, as ſet before him Human Nature, as it really is; deſcry the ſecret Springs, and inward Movements of the Soul; that ſo he may not miſtake the World, but be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him ſelf and other People: Such as may teach him, which are the proper Objects of his Fear, and Love, and Deſire; how he ought to be affected with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to all external Things; What Paſſion, what Virtue is: And how he ſhall diſcern the Difference between Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Avarice, between Servitude and Subjection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Liberty and Licentiouſneſs. And ſuffer not your ſelf to be diverted from ſuch early Attempts, by a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pretence of the Child's Incapacity for Matters of ſo important a Nature; for, aſſure your ſelf, he will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and digeſt theſe, as eaſily as thoſe of another and more ludicrous Kind. There is not one jot more of Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or Apprehenſion required, to the Underſtanding all the illuſtrious Examples of <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> than there is to the knowing the Fears of <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Wurwick,</hi> or <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, which is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt Uſeful Dearning in the World, is every whit as entertaining, as eaſie to be comprehended, as any Romance of the ſame Bulk. A Child, that can tell how many Cocks and Hens run about his Mother's Yard, and can count and diſtinguiſh his Uncles and Couſins; what ſhould hinder him from remembring with the ſame eaſe, the ſeven Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Twelve <hi>Caeſars?</hi> There
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:53648:583"/>is indeed a great Difference, between ſeveral Sciences; And the Faculties of Children have their proper Seaſons; but then this makes no Difference between the different Parts of the ſame Science, and Exerciſes of the ſame Faculty; and no Man will ever be able to prove, that one Matter of Fact is eaſie, and another difficult or impoſſible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but eſpecially, that the Falſe and Fictitious Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are accommodated to the Capacity of Children, and that True and Serious Narratives are above, and unfit for them. This looks, as if God had made our Minds only capable of being deceived; and given them a ſtrange Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in Lyes and Fables. But the Matter is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For the main Buſineſs is, to manage the Capacity of a Child well, and if this be done, the Improvement will quickly ſhew the Vanity of trifling with Children, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting their Abilities for greater and better Things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>

                              <p>The Third Admonition to this purpoſe is, that theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Governors would behave themſelves as becomes them towards their Charge; Not putting on always ſolemn and auſtere Looks, or treating them with Harſhneſs and Severity; but with Methods that are gentle and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, good Humour, and a cheerful Countenance. I cannot here but condemn without more ado, that general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of beating, whipping, ſcolding and ſtorming at Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and keeping them in all that Terror, and Subjection, which is uſual in ſome great Schools. For This is really a moſt unreaſonable Thing; of pernicious Conſequence, and as indecent as it would be in a Judge to fall into violent Paſſions with Criminals at the Bar; or a Phyſician to fall foul upon his Patients, and call them all to naught. How Prejudicial muſt this needs be in the Effect, how contrary to the Deſign of Education, which is, to make them in love with Virtue betimes, to ſweeten their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and train them in Virtue and Knowledge, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Behaviour! Now, this Imperious, and rough Treatment gives them a Prejudice to Inſtruction; makes them hate, and be afraid of it; fills them with Horrour, and Indignation, and Rage; tempts them to be Deſperate and Head-ſtrong; damps their Spirits, and depreſſes their Courage: Till at laſt by being uſed like Slaves, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate entirely into cowardly and ſlaviſh Diſpoſitions. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf hath given us fair Warning of this Miſchievous Conſequence; when he commands by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Coloſſ. iii. 21.</note> that <hi>Parents ſhould not provoke their Children to
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:53648:584"/>Wrath, leſt they be diſcouraged.</hi> This is the ready way to make them good for Nothing; they curſe their Teacher, and hate the Government they are under. If they do what they are bidden, it is only becauſe Your Eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they dare not do otherwiſe; not with any Cheerfulneſs or Satisfaction, or becauſe they are acted by any Noble and Generous Principle. If they have been tardy in their Duty, they take Sanctuary in the vileſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to ſave themſelves from Puniſhment. Lyes, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and ſhuffling Excuſes; Trembling, and Tears of Madneſs, and Deſpair; Playing Truant, and Running away from School; all which are Refuges infinitely worſe, than the Fault they were guilty of before.

And indeed as the Caſe ſtands now with our Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> this is the only way to make a Noiſe in the World. Reputation and Riches are not to be got without it. So that the Perſons we now ſpeak of, make a Trade of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſink it into a Mercenary, Pedantick, Sordid, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Thing. A Commodity bought dear, to be ſold again dearer at ſecond Hand. Theſe Huckſters are paſt all Cure, and it is not worth while to give our ſelves any Trouble about them. Not but that our Men of Mode are, ſome of them as Extravagantly Fooliſh in the other Extreme, who eſteem Learning an ungentile Thing, and ſomewhat too Pedantick and Mean for Quality, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem a Man the leſs for being a Scholar. This is but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Proof of their Folly and Emptineſs, and Want of all Senſe of Virtue and Honour, which their Ignorance, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, ſauntring Lives, and vain Fopperies, give us ſuch abundant Demonſtrations of every Day.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> But now for the Inſtruction of thoſe Others, <note place="margin">Learning and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</note> that give us ſome Hopes of Recovery, and for the diſcovering where their Miſtake lies, we muſt ſhew Two Things <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a Real Difference between Learning and Wiſdom; and that the Latter is infinitely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, before any the moſt exquiſite and exalted Degree of the Former. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they do not always go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nay, that moſt commonly they obſtruct each other; inſomuch that your Men of nice Learning are not often eminent for Wiſdom; nor your Truly wiſe Men deep Learned. There are, I confeſs, ſome Exceptions to this laſt Obſervation, but it were heartily to be wiſhed there were more of them. They that are ſo, are Men of Great, and Noble Souls; of which Antiquity furniſhes ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but the more Modern Times are very barren of them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> In order to the doing this Argument Right, we muſt firſt know what Learning and Wiſdom are. Now, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a vaſt Collection of other Peoples Excellencies; a
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:53648:586"/>Stock laid in with Labour and long Trouble, of all that we have ſeen, and heard, and read in Books; the Sayings and Actions of Great and Good Men, who have lived in all Ages and Nations. The Repoſitory or Magazine, where this Proviſion is treaſured up, is the Memory. He who is provided by Nature with a good Memory, hath no body to blame but himſelf, if he be not a Scholar; for he hath the Means in his own Hands. Wiſdom is a calm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Government of the Soul: That Man is Wiſe, who obſerves true Meaſures, and a due Decorum in his Thoughts, and Opinions, and Deſires; his Words, and Actions, and Deportment. In ſhort; Wiſdom is the Rule and Standard of the Soul, and he that uſes this Rule aright, that is, The Man of Judgment and Diſcretion, that ſees, and diſcerns, judges and eſteems Things according to their Nature and Intrinſick Value; who places each in its juſt Order and Degree, is the Perſon we would have every one attempt to be. And how Reaſonable that Advice is, will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by obſerving how far the greater Excellence of the Two, this of Wiſdom is.</p>
                              <p>Learning, however Valuable in it ſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> is yet but a poor and barren Accompliſhment, in Compariſon of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: For it is not only unneceſſary; being what Two Parts in Three of Mankind make a very good Shift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but the Uſefulneſs of is but ſmall; and there are but a very few Inſtances (comparatively) to which that Uſefulneſs extends. It contributes nothing at all to Life; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for how many do we ſee of all Qualities and Conditions, High and Low, Rich and Poor, that paſs their Time in great. Eaſe and Pleaſure, without knowing any thing at all of the Matter? There are a great many other Things, more Serviceable both to Men's private Happineſs, and to Human Society in General. Honour, and Reputation, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Birth, and Quality, and yet even Theſe are far from being abſolutely neceſſary; The moſt they can pretend to, is the being Ornaments, and Conveniences, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantages. It contributes Nothing to any Natural Operations; the moſt ignorant Man, in this Reſpect, is upon the Level with the greateſt Clerk. For Nature is of her ſelf a ſufficient Miſtreſs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and deals to every one the Knowledge needful for ſupporting her own Occaſions. Nor does it in any Degree aſſiſt a Man's Probity; no body is one whit the Honeſter, or Juſter for it; rather indeed it hinders and corrupts the Integrity of the Mind, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:53648:587"/>Men to be Subtle, and to diſtinguiſh all Plain-dealing quite away. Look into the Characters of Excellent Perſons in Hiſtory; and you ſhall find moſt amongſt them of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and very indifferent Attainments. Witneſs Old <hi>Rome,</hi> which, in the Days of her Ignorance, was renowned for Juſtice and Honour; but when Learning and Eloquence got the Aſcendent, the Fame of her Virtue was in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion; and in Proportion as Mens Wits grew more Subtle and Refin'd, Innocence and Simplicity fell into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and Contempt. Sects and Hereſies, Errours and Atheiſm it ſelf have ever been ſet on foot and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by Perſons of Artifice and Learning. The primitive Source of our Miſery and Ruine, and that firſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil, which inveigled and undid Mankind, was an unſeaſonable and intemperate Deſire of Knowledge. <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods diſcerning between Good and Evil,</hi> was that fatal Expectation, which depreſt our firſt Parents, and made them leſs than Man. The more Men employed their Wits in Study, the more plauſible, and conſequently the more dangerous Notions they ſtarted; which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> bid his <hi>Coloſſians beware, that they were not ſeduced by Philoſophy, and vain Deceit.</hi> And one of the Learnedeſt Men, that ever liv'd, ſpeaks but very meanly of it, as a Thing Vain and Unprofitable, Hurtful and Troubleſom, ſuch as was never to be enjoyed without many grievous Incumbrances; ſince he <hi>that increaſeth Knowledge</hi> muſt <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably increaſe Sorrow</hi> at the ſame Time. In a Word; Learning, it is confeſt, may Civilize and refine us, but it cannot moralize us; we may be more courteous, and converſable, and accompliſhed; but we cannot be one jot the Holier, the Juſter, more Temperate, or more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable for it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Nay, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it does us no Service, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſweetning of our Lives, or abating our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, for any of the Afflictions that embitter them. It rather ſets a Sharper Edge upon our Calamities, and raiſes our Senſe of them to be more quick and tender. Accordingly we ſee, that Children, and plain ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who meaſure their Misfortunes, only by what they feel at preſent, and neither anticipate, and give them an Imaginary Being; nor revive and, as it were, raiſe them from the Dead again by melancholy Reflections,) get over their Sufferings much more eaſily, and ſupport themſelves under them with much greater Temper and Moderation, than your quaint, and refined, and more thinking Men.
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:53648:587"/>Ignorance is in ſome Degree a good Remedy; a ſtrong Amulet againſt Misfortunes; and our Friends (it is very manifeſt) are of that Opinion, when they beg of us to forget, and not to think of them. For what is this but to drive us hither for Shelter? I confeſs ſuch Advice is Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and a mere Jeſt; for Remembring and Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are not Things in our own diſpoſal; and all we can contribute toward this, is not to torment our ſelves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly; not to awaken the ſleeping Lyon; and when ſuch Reflections offer themſelves, to ſoften, and counter-Work them, by Arguments for Patience and Contentedneſs; But here our Adviſers play the Surgeon's Part; who when they cannot heal the Wound, aſſwage the Pain and Skin over the Sore, as well as they can. Thoſe that have adviſed People to diſpatch themſelves, when their Sufferings are come to Extremity, and all Hope, all Poſſibility of Amendment gone, are directly of the ſame Mind: For what is Death but a State of Stupidity and Inſenſibility? and thoſe who ſeek a Refuge here, acknowledge Ignorance to be their laſt, and moſt effectual Remedy.</p>
                              <p>But now, Wiſdom is an Accompliſhment, of abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and univerſal Uſe; All Things fall within the Verge of its Juriſdiction, and nothing can be exempted, or conceal'd from its Cognizance. It rules and ſits Supreme in War and in Peace; in Publick and Private; nay, it preſides over our Frolicks and Feaſts; our Jollities and Recreations; for All theſe ought to be managed with Prudence, and Diſcretion, and Sobriety. And, where Wiſdom does not interpoſe, all things run into Diſorder and Confuſion.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> 
                                 <hi>Secondly.</hi> Learning is Servile, and Mean, and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, when put into the Balance with Wiſdom; It is a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Excellence, and borrowed with great Importunity too. A learned Man is like the Jay in the Fable, tricked up and made fine with the Feathers of other Birds. He ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off and entertains the World with his Reading; but this is like making a Feaſt at another Man's Coſt. Whereas the Wiſe Man lives upon his Rents, and hath an inexhauſtible Fund of his own: For Wiſdom is a Man's proper Poſſeſſion, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſetled upon him by Nature; but cultivated, and made Fertile, by Art, and Induſtry, and Exerciſe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> 
                                 <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Qualities and Conditions of theſe Two are vaſtly Different; more Graceful, more Generous in the One, than the Other. Learning is uſually Proud and Peeviſh, Captious and Cavilling, Arrogant and Preſumptuous,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:53648:588"/>Peremptory and Bold, Quarrelſome and addicted to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, Ill-mannerd and Indiſcreet. Wiſdom is Modeſt and Reſerved, Gentle and Peaceable, free from a Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and full of Reſpect. Again. Learning is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Forward and Affected, Unſeaſonable and Pretending, always thruſting it ſelf in at every Thing, and yet able to do Nothing: For it conſiſts not in Action, but in Talk. But Wiſdom is full of Efficacy and Activity; it Manages and Governs every Thing; and is never Troubleſom, or Vain; never Nauſeous or out of Time.</p>
                              <p>Thus it Appears, that there is a mighty Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true Wiſdom, and acquired Knowledge; and how much the One is Better and more Valuable than the Other. As much indeed, as a Thing that is indiſpenſably Neceſſary, and of general Uſe, Active and Vigorous, and Subſtantial; Noble, and Virtuous, and Becoming; excels another, which is Serviceable but in ſome Caſes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Neceſſary in none; Impotent and Unactive, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick and Mean, Preſumptuous and Poſitive, Stiff and Humorſome; Captious and Cavilling.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Let us Now proceed to the Other part of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which undertakes to prove, that theſe Two do not always go together; nay, that they are generally found ſingle and aſunder. The Account of this, ſo far as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is concern'd in it, ſeems to be, what hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly explain'd at large; that the Temperaments of the Brain, which capacitate and diſpoſe Men to theſe ſeveral Accompliſhments, are diſtant and incompatible: For That where Memory excels, which qualifies Men for acquired Learning, is Moiſt; and the other, where Wiſdom is Predominant and Judgment excels, is Dry. This is alſo hinted to us, by what the Scriptures mention to have befallen our firſt Parents; for in the Inſtant that they fixed their Deſires upon Speculative Knowledge, Wiſdom forſook them quite; and the Advantages of this Kind, which were included in the Original Perfection of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were withdrawn. And conſtant Experience ſhews us, that the Fate of their Succeſſors is ſtill in Proportion the ſame. The Greateſt and moſt Flouriſhing Empires and Common-wealths, both Ancient and Modern have been, and yet are govern'd by Wiſdom deſtitute of Scholarſhip; both in Civil and Military Affairs. <hi>Rome</hi> was as Ignorant as any other Part of the World, for the Firſt Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years; and then was it's Acme both for Virtue and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:53648:588"/>when Learning came in, Corruption and Vice, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Civil Wars entred with it. The moſt glorious Conſtitution the World ever ſaw, was that of the <hi>Lacoede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> founded by <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> The Gallanteſt Men in Story were bred under it, and yet they do not ſeem to have made any Pretenſion to Learning, or to expreſs any great Eſteem for it at that time. This was the Famous School for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Wiſdom; and conquered <hi>Athens,</hi> the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined City in the World, the Scene of Sciences, the Seat of the Muſes, and Store-houſe of Philoſophy. Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are Notorious in Ancient Story. If we deſcend down to our own Times: All thoſe large, wealthy and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Kingdoms in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> lived very well, and wanted neither Grandeur nor Plenty; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had Learning, nor did they ever feel the Want of it; nay; they were Ignorant even of reading and writing; and the Knowledge as they have now, hath been purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the expence of their Liberty: Beſides that, they have learnt to cheat, and to be Vicious into the Bargain, and ſeveral wicked Arts, never ſo much as mention'd amongſt them before. But indeed where do we find an Empire, for Glory and Succeſs, comparable to that of the <hi>Grand Signior?</hi> He, like the Lyon of the World, renders himſelf Formidable to all his Neighbours; and is a Check and Terror to the Princes and Monarchs of the Earth. And yet in this whole Dominion, Nothing Reigns ſo Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, as profound Ignorance of Letters; No Profeſſors of Sciences, no Schools, no Allowance to read for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inſtruction of others; no, not even in Religion it ſelf. What then hath contained this State in ſuch excellent Order? what hath procur'd all its Succeſſes? what indeed but Prudence, and Diſcipline, and Conduct? Turn your Eyes now, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe other Kingdoms where Learning hath been in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reputation. That of <hi>France,</hi> for Example, which ſeems to ſucceed <hi>Athens</hi> in all its Glory. The Principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this Crown, the Conſtables, and Mareſchals, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and Secretaries of State, through whoſe Hands all Buſineſs of Moment paſſes, are for the moſt Part Perſons of little or no acquired Learning. And we know, that ſeveral eminent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, and Princes, and Founders of Common-wealths, have utterly baniſh'd all Studies of this Nature as the Poyſon and Plague of a Nation; So did <hi>Licinius,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and an ancienter and better Man than all theſe, <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> This is a ſufficient Proof, that there may be Wiſdom,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:53648:589"/>where there is no acquired Learning. Let us next enquire, whether we can find Learning deſtitute of Wiſdom; and the Inſtances of this Part, are no leſs obvious, and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than the other. Do but take notice of great part of the Men, who make Learning their Study and Profeſſion, whoſe Heads are full of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and the School-Men. Are there any People in the World more aukward and uncouth in Buſineſs? Is it not a common Proverb, when we ſee a Man Odd and Clumſie, to ſay <hi>He is a mere Scholar?</hi> One would almoſt think, that they had pored away their Senſes; and that exceſs of Knowledge had ſtunn'd and ſtupify'd them. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, who would have made excellent Perſons, had they not ſunk and dwindled into Pedantry; and had been wiſer Men, if they had traded upon their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Stock, and never ſat down to Books at all? and how many of their own Brethren do we ſee, who never had that Education, and prove much ſhrewder Men, and better Contrivers, more quick and expert in all manner of Buſineſs? Take one of your Nice Diſputants, or quaint Rhetoricians, bring him into a debate at the next Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, where any Matter of Government, or Civil Intereſt is under Deliberation; put him upon ſpeaking to the Point, and he ſhall Bluſh and Tremble, turn Pale, and Cough, and Hem: But it is Odds, if he ſay any Thing to the Purpoſe. At laſt perhaps, you ſhall have a formal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue; ſome Definitions of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or Quotations out of <hi>Tully,</hi> with an <hi>Ergo</hi> at the End of them. And yet at the ſame Meeting you ſhall have a dull, plodding Alderman, that chalks up all his Acounts behind the Door; and can neither write nor read, and yet this Fellow, by ſeeing and knowing the World, ſhall out of his own Obſervation and Experience, come to better Reſolutions, and propoſe more feaſible and proper Expedients, than the ſubtileſt and moſt refin'd Student of them all. Were Matters indeed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, that Men turned their Speculation into Practice, and took Care to apply their Reading to the Purpoſes of Human Life; the Advantage of Learning would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; and we ſee how illuſtriouſly ſuch Perſons ſhine in the World. And therefore what I have ſaid upon this Occaſion, is not to be ſtretched to the Prejudice of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general; but only to ſuch a falſe Opinion of it, as depends upon This alone for the moſt eligible, and Only Qualification of the Mind of Man; and ſo reſts upon it, and buries it in Inactivity. This the foregoing Inſtances
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:53648:589"/>ſhew is frequently done, and a very vulgar Error; and conſequently they prove the Point, for the Illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which alone they are produced; and that is, That this Diſtinction between Wiſdom and Learning is not Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, but grounded upon a real Differece; and that in Fact theſe Two do not always go Hand in Hand, nor meet in the ſame Perſon.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> This I deſign to make appear more fully in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraphs of this Chapter; for I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, not to content my ſelf with urging bare matter of Fact, but likewiſe to enter into the Reaſon of the Thing. An Enquiry, which I am the more Zealous, and look upon my ſelf obliged to ſatisfie, that ſo I may prevent any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence being taken at the former Reflection; and cut off any Suſpicious, which ſome might be provoked to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning me, as if I were an Enemy to Learning, and thought it Inſignificant and Deſpicable. There is, I confeſs, ground ſufficient for this Queſtion, why Wiſdom and Learning ſhould not go together; for it is a very odd Caſe, and ſeems foreign to the Reaſon of the Thing, that a Man ſhould not be very much the Wiſer, for being a better Scholar; ſince Learning and Study is without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie the ready Road, and a moſt Excellent Inſtrument and Preparation to Wiſdom. Take any Two Men, equal in all other Reſpects; let the One be a Man of Letters, the Other not ſo. 'Tis plain, He who hath employed his Time in Study, ought to be a great deal Wiſer than the other; and it will be expected from him, that he ſhould prove ſo: For he hath all the Advantages, that the Unletter'd Man hath; a Natural Capacity, Reaſon and Underſtanding; and he hath a great deal more beſides too; the Additional Improvements of Reading, which have furniſh'd him with the Examples, Directions, Diſcourſes, and Determinations, of the Greateſt Men that ever were in the World. Muſt not this Perſon then be Wiſer, more Apprehenſive and Judicious, of a more exalted Virtue, and greater Addreſs, than the other who is altogether deſtitute of ſuch Helps; Since he hath the ſame Stock to ſet up with, and all theſe foreign Aſſiſtances acquired, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to him from all the Quarters of the Univerſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides? Since, as one ſays very truly, The Natural Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, when joyn'd and ſtrengthened by the Accidental, make a Noble and Complete Compoſition. And yet, in deſpight of all our Reaſonings to the contrary, Experience,
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:53648:590"/>and undeniable Matter of Fact, give us Ten thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it's being otherwiſe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Now, the true Reaſon, and ſatisfactory Anſwer to this Doubt, ſtands really thus. That the Methods of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not well ordered. Books and Places of Publick Education furniſh Men with admirable Matter; but they do not imbibe, and uſe it, as they ſhould do. Hence it is, that vaſt Improvements in Knowledge turn to ſo very ſlender Account: They are Poor in the midſt of Plenty; and, like <hi>Tantalus</hi> in the Fable, ſtarved with the Meat at their Mouths. When they apply themſelves to Reading, the Thing they principally aim at, is to learn Words more than Things; or at leaſt, they content themſelves with a very ſlight and ſuperficial Knowledge of Things; and He is reputed the beſt Scholar, who hath made the largeſt Collections, and cramm'd his Memory fulleſt. Thus they are I earned, but not with any Care of poliſhing their Minds, and forming their Judgments, or growing practically Wiſe. Like a Man that puts his Bread in his Pocket, and not in his Stomach; and if he go on Thus, he may be famiſh'd for want of Suſtenance, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Pockets are full. Thus they continue Fools, with a vaſt Treaſure of Wiſdom in their Brains. They ſtudy for Entertainment, or Oſtentation, or Gain, or Applauſe; and not for their own true Benefit, and the becoming Uſeful to the World. They are living Repertories and Common-place Books; and would be rare Compilers of Precedents and Reports. <hi>Cicero,</hi> they tell you, or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> ſay Thus and Thus; but all this while, They ſay not one Tittle of their own Obſervation. They are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Two great Faults: One is, that they do not apply what they read, to themſelves, nor make it their own by Meditation, Reflection and Uſe; ſo that all this while they have not advanc'd one Step in Virtue; nor are One whit more Prudent, more Reſolute and Confirm'd in Goodneſs; and thus their Scholarſhip is never digeſted, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the Soul, but ſwims and floats about in the Brain, and conſequently can never nouriſh, or do them any manner of Good. The Other is, That in all this Time and Trouble, ſo diligently ſpent in heaping together the Wealth of other Men, they neglect their own Proper and Natural Fund, and let this lie dead, and ruſt upon their Hands, for want of Exerciſe. Now, Others, who are not capable of Study, have nothing but their own Common
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:53648:590"/>Senſe and Reaſon to be intent upon; and therefore they muſt keep it in conſtant Employment. They manure and cultivate their little Plat of Ground, and reap a Crop in proportion to their Diligence; grow Better, and Wiſer, more Reſolure and Steady, though not ſo Knowing, or ſo Eloquent, ſo Wealthy, or ſo Celebrated in the World. The whole of which Obſervation may be reduced to that ſhort Maxim of an Author to this purpoſe; <hi>That weak and little Souls are ſpoiled by Learning, but vigorous and great Ones are perfected by it.</hi> The Former are diverted by it from Matters more Weighty and Subſtantial; the Latter make it only Subſervient to ſuch, and tranſcribe it all into their own Practice.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> Now, the Method, which I would preſcribe, for reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this unprofitable and ſuperficial Way of Study, is as follows. Not to trouble our Heads, and waſt our Time, in retaining and treaſuring up other Mens Knowledge; only that we may be able to repeat and quote it, and make a Shew and Noiſe with it in Company; or elſe to convert it to Gain, and ſo employ it to Sordid and Mercenary Purpoſes; but to enrich our Minds in good Earneſt, by making other Mens Notions our own: Not barely to give them Lodging and Entertainment in our Souls, and uſe them like Gueſts, but to incorporate and tranſubſtantiate them: Not only to ſprinkle the Mind with them, but thoroughly to ſoak, and drench it; that the Tincture may be taken all over, and we may become effectually Wiſe, and Good, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and brave; For if This be not done, what is all our Study good for?<note n="*" place="bottom">Non paranda nobis ſolùm, ſed fruenda ſapientia eſt.</note> 
                                 <hi>We muſt not only get Wiſdom, but we muſt uſe and enjoy it,</hi> if we will do any thing to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. We muſt not do like the Gatherers of Noſegays, that pick up here and there whole Flowers, and after that make them up into Noſegays to ſell or give away; For thus unskilful Students do; They get together a Collection of good Sayings and Obſervations out of the Books they have read; merely for the Sake of Oſtentation, and to put them off in all Company where they come: But we muſt imitate the Bees, that never take away the Flower entire; but ſit and brood upon it, ſuck out the Life, and Spirit, and Quinteſſence, and convert it into their own Subſtance, and Nouriſhment; and when This is done, they do not render it back again in Thyme, or Marjoram, as they
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:53648:591"/>drew it in, but diſtil it into moſt delicious and excellent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Juſt after the ſame Manner, We are not obliged to put our ſelves under the Slavery of getting Things by Heart; and ſaying them again by Rote; (which ſome value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon,) nor need we tye up our Attention, to that ſuperſtitious Vanity of others, That of remembring preciſely the very Paſſage, and Page, and Chapter; (all which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours our Time, and our Pains, and is bought very Dear with the Loſs of that which our Minds ſhould principally aim at;) but we ſhould draw out the Marrow and Subſtance of our Authors, feed and feaſt our Thoughts upon them; deduce Inferences, and form the Judgment, and give the Soul quite another Turn; we ſhould bring all Home, and lay it cloſe to our Hearts; that it may be entirely of a Piece with us, inſtruct our Underſtandings, regulate our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, direct and incline our Wills, and guide our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in all their practical Determinations and Debates. In a Word, The Principles of Honeſty, and Wiſdom, and Prudence, and Perſeverance, which we meet with ſcattered up and down in Books, we are to collect into one entire Body; and out of that make an Honeſt, Wiſe, Prudent, and Well-reſolved Man. So ſays <hi>Tacitus</hi> upon a like Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note n="*" place="bottom">Non ad pompam, nec ad ſpeciem, nec ut nomine magniſico ſequi otium velis, ſed quò firmior adverſus fortuita Rempublicam capeſſas.</note> 
                                 <hi>Our Intention muſt not be Pomp, and Shew, the Credit and Reputation of being Book-learned; but the fitting our ſelves for Action and Buſineſs, and fortifying our Minds againſt any Accidents that may happen to us.</hi>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> In order hereunto, there muſt be Care uſed, that a Proper and Prudent Choice be made of the Sciences young People apply their Studies to. Now thoſe, which I dare take upon me to recommend, becauſe they manifeſtly conduce moſt of any, to that ſort of Study which I have here been propounding, are Natural and Moral Philoſophy; for Theſe teach us what it is to live, and what to live Well; and entertain us with the Images and Beauties both of Nature, and of Virtue; ſhew us; what we are, and what be ought to be. Under the Heads of Morality I comprehend Politicks, Oeconomicks, and Hiſtory, as well as that which is more Peculiarly call'd Ethicks. All other Studies are in a manner Emptineſs and Air, Diverſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the Mind, but not of Weight enough to make them our Buſineſs. And therefore we ſhould take a little of Them by the
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:53648:591"/>by; but theſe we may fix and dwell upon, becauſe They will not fail to ſtick by Us, and amply to reward our Pains.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> This End, to which the Inſtruction of young People ſhould be directed, and the ſtating our Compariſon between Wiſdom and acquired Learning hath detain'd us a very great while, by Reaſon of the Controverſies ariſing upon it. Let us now at length proſecute the other Parts of this Subject, and come to thoſe Directions which ſtill remain behind. Now, the Manner of either informing one's ſelf, or inſtructing others, is very various: For firſt there are Two Ways of Learning, the One Verbal; that is, by Precepts, Inſtructions, and Leſſons read, or heard, or explained to us; or elſe by Conference and Diſcourſe with able and good Men, thus poliſhing, and whetting our Minds upon Theirs; as Iron is brightened, and cleanſed, and ſharpened by the File. This is a very agreable, and pleaſant, and Natural Courſe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> The Other Method of Inſtruction is by Facts; This is what we call Example, and a mighty Advantage may be made of it, not only with Regard to thoſe Good and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Ones, which we ſhall do well carefully to Copy, and conform our ſelves to; but to thoſe likewiſe, that are Ill; ſuch as we are obliged to avoid and deteſt, and ſuffer no manner of Reſemblance, or Agreement with. Some Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are ſo formed, that they improve abundantly more, by this kind of Inſtruction taken from Contraries; and are much more dextrous at Declining, than Imitating. This is particularly the Method, which publick Juſtice takes with us; It condemns one Malefactor, that he may be a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and create Horror in others. And <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder uſed to ſay, that <hi>Wiſe Men might learn a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>deal more from Fools, than Fools could from Wiſe Men.</hi> The <hi>Lacedoemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to work in their Children an Abhorrence of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and draw them off from this beaſtly Vice effectually, made their Slaves drunk; that ſo this Odious and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Spectacle, might leave laſting Impreſſions behind it. Now, this <hi>Second</hi> Way of Learning by Example, is inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the eaſier, and more entertaining of the Two. To learn by Precepts is a long and tedious Journey, and carries us a great way about; becauſe it coſts us Time and Pains to underſtand them; and freſh Labour to remember what we do underſtand; and, after all this, the greateſt and moſt difficult Part of our Buſineſs, is to be ready and punctual in the Practice of what we do remember. So that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily aſſure our ſelves of reaping the Fruit, which is,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:53648:592"/>and ought to be propounded, as the Recompence of our Studies in this kind. But now Example and Imitation comes Home to us preſently, and does the Work at once; it draws us on with greater Eagerneſs and Zeal; it fires us with a Noble Emulation, of our Patterns, and encourages us with a Proſpect of the ſame Reputation and Advantage, which thoſe Good and Great Men have already attained to by their ſhining Virtues. All Seeds do by Degrees conform to the Quality of the Soil into which they are tranſplanted; and carry the Reliſh of that which is the natural Growth of the Place. And thus the Minds and Manners of Men are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated and transformed, into the Diſpoſitions, and Habits, of the Perſons, whoſe Actions they contemplate, and whoſe Company they frequent: For there is an Univerſal Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Nature, and One thing is daily more and more changed, and drawn into a nearer Reſemblance of another.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Now, theſe Methods of Improvement, both by Verbal Precepts, and by Examples, are capable of a farther Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For they are deduc'd and drawn into Practice from Excellent Perſons; who are either now living, by the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Converſation, and Mutual Conference, or ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; or elſe from ſuch as are already dead, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, and ſuch Accounts, as Hiſtory delivers to us concerning them.</p>
                              <p>The Former, of holding a Correſpondence with the Living, is the more Lively, and Vigorous, and Natural. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a very Profitable Exerciſe; much in requeſt among the Ancients, and eſpecially in <hi>Greece;</hi> but then it is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and uncertain; it depends upon another, and you cannot always enjoy it, when you would. It is alſo Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and Rare, for a Man cannot every where meet with Perſons proper for it, and leſs yet can he enjoy them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to improve by. This again is capable of being pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, either about Home, or at a greater Diſtance, by travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and viſiting foreign Countries. An that is an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I confeſs, very conſiderable, provided a Man make the moſt of it: For the End of Travelling is not to entertain our ſelves with fine Sights, or to bring back an Account of the Buildings, or Grottos, or Fountains we ſee abroad; but to ſtudy the Natives, and obſerve their different Humours, and Manner of Living, their Vices and Virtues, their Laws and Cuſtoms, their private Conduct, and publick Conſtitutions. This is a moſt agreeable, and a moſt profitable Way of Education in all Reſpects; It contributes much to Health,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:53648:592"/>by keeping the Body in Morion and Moderate Exerciſe, a due Medium between Idleneſs and Fatigue: And it keeps the Mind in continual Employment too, by preſenting new and ſtrange Objects to it every Day; and provoking it to proper Obſervations and Reflections from them; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the drawing Compariſons between theſe freſh and foreign Matters, and what we had ſeen and were acquainted with before. And indeed there is no better School of Life in the World, than the ſeeing continually ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tempers and Ways of living; contemplating the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature in all her different Forms, and out of all theſe, to pick and cull that, which may complete and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn our own Converſation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> The other Sort of Correſpondence is kept up with the Dead by the Help of Books; and This is more ſure and conſtant to us. We have it in our own Diſpoſal, and can go into this Company when we will; and beſide, it is more ſuitable to the Circumſtances of moſt Men, becauſe the Trouble and Expence is much Eaſier, than in the former Caſe. They who know how to make a good Uſe of this, may reap infinite Advantage and Satisfaction from it. It diſcharges us from the Burden of a troubleſome Idleneſs; fills up the void Spaces of Leiſure; and leaves no Room for any Complaints of Time hanging upon our Hands; It draws us from the vain and tormenting Imaginations of a roving Mind; and diverts the Uneaſineſs of any Affairs or Accidents from without, which are apt to diſtract and perplex our Thoughts, when they find us out of Buſineſs, and at Liberty to attend them: It is a powerful Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt Vice; not only by the Force of the Arguments and Inſtructions it furniſhes us with, to oppoſe and ſubdue it, but by keeping us out of Harm's Way, and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Temptation: It miniſters Comfort, and marvellous Relief in our Calamities and Sufferings; but then it muſt be acknowledged with all, that it only contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Health and Good Conſtitution of the Mind; for this is a Sedentary Life, it keeps the Body out of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and, if purſued with great Vehemence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Application, waſts its Strength, impairs its Vigour and Complexion, and diſpoſes it to Melancholy, and Diſeaſes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> The next thing to be done is to give ſome Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Tutor's Method, and the Forms of Inſtruction,<note place="margin">Putting our Scholars up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Diſcourſe</note> which it will be proper for him to Obſerve, in Order to the

The <hi>Firſt</hi> Advice I ſhall give upon it is, That he would frequently confer with his Charge; ask him Queſtions, and put him upon giving his own Opinion, upon every freſh Occaſion or Object, that offers it ſelf to his Conſideration. This I am afraid is but too oppoſite to the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generally in uſe; the Maſter talks All, and teaches his Children in a Dogmatical Way; thus pouring his own Notions into their Heads like Water into a Veſſel; ſo that They in the mean while have nothing to do but to keep their Ears open, and are purely paſſive in the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is certainly a very Ill Cuſtom.<note n="*" place="bottom">Obeſt plerum<expan>

                                 <hi>The Authority of the Teacher, and his taking ſo much upon himſelf, is a common and a mighty Hindrance to the Improvement even of the moſt diligent Scholar.</hi> Their Apprehenſion ſhould be awakend and warmed by ſtarting of Doubts, and requiring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what we have infuſed into them; and they ſhould likewiſe be indulged in the ſame Liberty of asking us Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and putting Caſes, informing themſelves, and opening their own Way. If we never allow them to come in for a Share of the Diſcourſe, all we ſay to them will be to little Purpoſe: Our Scholar only gives us the Hearing, and that ſometimes but Coldly and Negligently neither; but as to any Application or Improvement, he troubles not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor is at all Zealous about it; becauſe This is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he is not called upon for, nor concern'd to bear a Part in the Converſation. Nor is it enough in this Caſe, that we make them Deliver their Opinions, except we moreover require them to alledge their Reaſons, and oblige them to argue in Defence of it: For this is the Way to prevent their talking without Book, and by Rote; This will make them Heedful and Attentive, Cautious what they ſay, and conſiderate before they ſpeak; and, for their better Encouragement to confer with us freely, we muſt commend, and make the beſt of what they ſay; and where the Performance falls ſhort, we muſt accept the Endeavour very graciouſly. This Method of Inſtruction by way of Queſtions, was admirably put in Practice by <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was indeed the greateſt Maſter in it of all the Philoſophers; and we ſee all along in <hi>Plato,</hi> by what a Chain and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Connexion of Enquiries, he led Men gently up to the Truth; and by inſenſible Degrees gain'd his Point upon the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:53648:593"/>Objectors. But indeed a much Greater than <hi>Socrates</hi> hath ſet us a Pattern in it; Even our Bleſſed Lord, who, with inimitable Prudence, appealed to Men's own Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as he ſometimes taught his Diſciples, ſo did he at others confute his Adverſaries out of their own Mouths. Now theſe Queſtions and Conferences need not always be confin'd to ſuch Subjects, as the Attainments of Memory, or Fancy, or what we call acquired Knowledge are concern'd in; but may, (indeed they ought much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to) be extended to ſuch as are Tryals of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſound Senſe. So that no ſort of Subjects, will be excluded; for all, even the leaſt and moſt Inconſiderable, are capable of being employed to very good Purpoſe. The Negligence of a Servant, the Folly of a Child, the Moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ill-nature of a Clown, the Sports or Plays of Boys, the Talk at Table; for the Excellency and Buſineſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does by no Means conſiſt in the Management or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Weighty or Sublime Matters only, but in paſſing a true and Right Deciſion, and ſetting a juſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon all Manner of Things, be they Great or Small, Trivial or Important: It is not the Condition of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the Truth, and Pertinency of what is reſolved, and ſaid upon it, that proves the Perſon to be Judicious. It will be very convenient therefore to let him deliver his Opinion of Men and Actions; but, to be ſure, always to ſay ſomewhat in Juſtification of his Opinion; and to let nothing paſs without ſome Reflexion, and the Inducements, which move him to think thus rather than otherwiſe: For This will have a wonderful Influence in the directing his Conſcience, and practical Judgment; which is of all other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties moſt neceſſary to be cultivated and ſet Right; becauſe, if This Happen to go amiſs, all our Actions which reſult from its Determination, muſt conſequently be Irregular. <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Tutor in <hi>Xenophon</hi> took this Courſe; and propounded the following Matter of Fact for an Exerciſe and Leſſon to his Pupil. A great Boy having a ſhort Coat, gave it to one of his Playfellows, who was leſs than himſelf, and took away his Coat in Exchange, which was Larger, and too Big for the right Owner: Now, the Thing required of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was to deliver his Judgment upon this Matter. <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Opinion was, that the Matter was very well ordered, and much better than before; for now both the Boys were fitted to their Turn, whereas, till that Exchange was made, neither of them was ſo. His Tutor rebuked him very ſharply for ſo raſh and unjuſt a Judgment; for that he had
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:53648:594"/>only conſidered the Convenience of the Thing, and not the Right and Merits of the Cauſe; ſince Juſtice is of ſo much greater Conſequence, that the other ought not to be put into the Balance with it; nor muſt a Man's Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be invaded, upon the Pretence of giving ſomewhat that its ſitter for his Circumſtances in the ſtead of it. This now is an excellent Way of informing them. Again, When they repeat or quote any Thing out of their Books; as <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or the like, This Task ſhould be impoſed, not merely for the Sake of retaining it in their Memories, but to faſten it in their Minds, and give them a true Taſt of it, and enable them to judge of it themſelves. And, in order to this, he ſhould take it under all its different Appearances turn and examine it every way; and be taught to apply it to ſeveral Subjects. It would be a Matter of very ſmall Conſequence, for a Youth to tell a Story, of <hi>Cato</hi>'s killing himſelf, for Fear of falling into the Hands of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> or how <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> engaged in the taking <hi>Caeſar</hi> off; This is the leaſt Part of the Improvement ſuch Hiſtorical Narrations are Capable of furniſhing. The Main Point is, To call theſe Men before him, to Arraign, and Try, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence them for theſe Actions; Whether they did Well or Ill; whether they conſulted the Publick Good, and behaved themſelves like true Patriots; what Prudence, and Juſtice, and Courage, there was in theſe Inſtances; and wherein theſe Excellencies exerted, or their Contrary Qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed themſelves. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In all the Queſtions, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, he ought to take Care, that his Charge proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth; that he be taught to expreſs himſelf Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and Pertinently; to reaſon juſtly; and to exerciſe his Practical Judgment of Things, which is an Excellence and Accompliſhment infinitely to be preferred before any the niceſt Subtilties of the moſt refined ſpeculative Knowledge. And in ſuch Exerciſes as theſe, No Doubt ſhould be left unſatisfied; no Point ſuffered to paſs off Imperfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd; no Connivence given to lame and ſuperficial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Things, the little Shiftings of an Argument, or the calling of an other Cauſe; but the Scholar muſt be preſt home; carried to the Bottom of all that is propounded; kept cloſe to the Matter in Hand; that ſo he may be a perfect Maſter of what he undertakes, and have ſolid and ſubſtantial Grounds for the Opinions he entertains.</p>

                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ought to train his Pupil up to a becoming Curioſity, and a Deſire to know every Thing his Condition
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:53648:594"/>is capable of. That ſo he may always have his Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and his Wits about him; applying himſelf to weigh and conſider Critically all that is ſaid or done in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; taking nothing at firſt View, without Reflection, and a Second Examination of it privately in his own Thoughts. And not only ſo, but with Modeſty and Temper to inform himſelf, and conſult others, in Matters both of Right, and of Fact. It is a common Proverb, <hi>That he who never asks Queſtions, will never be a Wiſe Man;</hi> that is, If a Man's Mind be not kept ſtirring, it will ruſt and mould; and nothing but conſtant Uſe and Exerciſe can cleanſe and brighten it. Now, whatever of this Kind falls under his Conſideration, ſhould be managed to the beſt Advantage; applyed and brought home to himſelf; diſcourſed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed upon with others; and that, whether it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what already paſt, to diſcover what Defects there were, and which were the falſe Steps in it; or whether it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what future, that he may govern himſelf regularly; be warned of any Hazards and Dangers that attend what he goes about; and prevent Miſcarriages and Inconvenience, by growing wiſe in Time. Children ſhould never be left to their own idle Fancies, to dare and trifle alone; For their Age and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, not being of it ſelf able to furniſh Noble Matter of Thought, will certainly dwindle into Vanity, and feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Impertinencies and Whimſies of a Size with their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. They ſhould therefore be kept in conſtant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; to exerciſe and give them a Manly Way of thinking; and particularly to beget and excite this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Humor, and eager Appetite of Knowledge, which will be ſure to keep their Souls always awake and buſie, and by inſpiring them with a Noble Emulation, be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally putting forward to freſh and larger Attainments. And this Curioſity, if qualified, as I have here deſcribed it, will neither be Vain and Fruitleſs in it ſelf, nor Troubleſome or Unmannerly to any, they converſe with.</p>

                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another neceſſary Care in the Inſtructing of Children is, To frame and mould their Minds, after the Model of Univerſal Nature, taking the World at large for our Pattern; to make the Univerſe their Book, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Subject lies before them, to draw it in ſull Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and repreſent the ſeveral Opinions and Cuſtoms, which do, or ever have prevailed with regard to it.

The contrary Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, is to ſuffer one's ſelf to be led about hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked; to renounce the Uſe of Reaſon quite, and ſubmit to the Condition of Brutes, whoſe Buſineſs is only to know their Driver, and go as they are directed: Let every Thing therefore be fairly propounded; let the Arguments on each Side be ſtated, and ſet in their true Light, and then let him chooſe, as Judgment ſhall determine him. If he be at a Loſs, which Side he ſhould incline to, let him deliberate longer, and doubt on; ſuch a diſtruſt and uncertainty of Mind is an excellent Sign; more Safe, more Promiſing than a raſh Confidence, which reſolves Right or Wrong, and thinks it ſelf always ſure, though it can give no reaſon why. The Perplexities and Dilemmas of a cautious and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſon, are much to be preferred before even the true Determinations that are made in a Heat, and by Chance. But then, as the Youth ſhould be taught always to practiſe upon his own Judgment, ſo ſhould he learn likewiſe to have a Modeſt Diffidence of his Abilities; and when any Difficulty interpoſes, or the Reſolution is of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to conſult thoſe, who are proper to be adviſed with, and never venture to come to a peremptory Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, merely upon the Strength of his own reaſoning.

And This is a Buſineſs,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:53648:596"/>which ought to be begun very early indeed, a Man can hardly ſet about it too ſoon: For Vicious Diſpoſitions grow into Habits apace; ſo that the Corruption of Nature is ſure to be beforehand with us; and, if theſe Things be not ſtifled in the Birth, it is very difficult Dealing with them afterwards.

Chap. 9.</note> This will preſerve them from that Forwardneſs which puts them upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Diſpute, and attacking all they come hear. With ſome Perſons it is never proper for us to engage at all; as thoſe particularly, whoſe Quality is much above, or very much below our own; whether the Difference lie in Birth, or Riches, or Honour, or Parts, or Characters; Theſe can never be a fit Match for us at any time. But indeed, Thoſe that are ſo ſhou'd not be encounter'd at All Times, nor upon All Occaſions; not for a trifling Circumſtance, an improper Expreſſion; in ſhort, What is of little Moment in it ſelf, or little or no Concern to Us, will not juſtifie our wrangling for it. To let nothing go without putting in an Exception to it, is ill-manner'd, impertinent, and troubleſome: Bur even in thoſe things that are worth a Diſpute, to be opinionative and peremptory, warm and violent, clamorous and loud, is as much a Breach of this Virtue; for Modeſty teaches Men to be Meek and Gentle, Moderate and Condeſcending; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reconcil'd with a poſitive dogmatical way of Talk with an abounding in our own Senſe, and a Reſolution not to be convinc'd: But it yields the Point when it is no longer defenſible; and, As it never diſputes for Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Diſputing's ſake, ſo it hath a juſt Deference to the Perſon, and his contrary Opinion; it preſerves Decency and good Manners; allows all that can poſſibly be granted, and takes Care to ſoften the Oppoſition of that which Judgment will not ſuffer it to allow. But of This I have ſpoken in another Part of this Treatiſe already; and therefore ſhall diſmiſs the Subject at preſent, and with it Three parts of that Duty which Parents owe to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> The Fourth and Laſt part of this Duty concerns the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they ought to bear towards their Children, <note place="margin">Paternal Affection.</note> and the manner of treating and converſing with them when they are
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:53648:598"/>grown up, and the former Rules have had their deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now we need not be told that the Affection between Parents and Children is natural and reciprocal. But it is ſtronger and more natural on the Parent's ſide; becauſe This is the ſtreight Courſe of Nature, carrying on the Life, and promoting the Succeſſion of Mankind by the Deſcent of a right Line; whereas That of Children is only by way of Rebound and Reflection, and conſequently cannot move ſo vigorouſly back again, as the former does forward. This indeed ſeems rather to be the Paying of a Debt, and the Senſe and Return of Kindneſſes receiv'd, than free, and natural, and pure Love. Beſides, He that firſt does the Kindneſs, loves more than the Perſon who is paſſive, and receives it: And therefore the Parent, who is the firſt Mover, loves more vehemently than he is belov'd again. Of this Aſſertion there are many Arguments to aſſure us. Every Thing is fond of Exiſtence, and Exiſtence proves it ſelf by Exerciſe and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now whoever does Good to another, does after ſome ſort exiſt in that Perſon; and he who gives Being, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly lives and acts in That Being which is propagated by him. He that does a Kindneſs, does a noble and generous Thing; but he who receives it, hath not the ſame to alledg. For the Virtue is the proper Quality of the Firſt; but the Proſit and Advantage is peculiar to the Second. Now Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we know, is rooted in the Nature of the Thing, and conſequently is a more worthy and amiable, a more firm and permanent Quality, than that of Advantage can poſſibly be; for This is additional, occaſional, and accidental only; it may quickly vaniſh into nothing, and take it ſelf away. Again, We are fond of thoſe Things that are obtain'd with Difficulty and Expence; <hi>That is dear to us which coſts us dear,</hi> ſays the Provetb. But the Bringing Children into the World, the Cheriſhing, Maintaining, and Educating them, are infinitely more troubleſome for Parents to beſtow, than it is poſſible to be to Children to receive theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> But this Love of Parents is capable of a very juſt Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and tho' there be two different ſorts of it,<note place="margin">Of two kinds.</note> yet thus far they agree, that both are Natural. The Firſt is purely and entirely ſo; little, if at all remov'd from that which we commonly call <hi>Inſtinct</hi> in Brutes; for they partake of it as well as we. This diſpoſes Parents to a ſtrange Tenderneſs for their Children, even at the Breaſt, and in the Cradle, and gives the firſt Infant-Cries and Complaints, a wondrous Power of moving Compaſſion, and piercing their very Souls.
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:53648:598"/>This likewiſe inſpires an unaccountable Fondneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; while as yet they are only capable of divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and as meer Play-things, as thoſe Wax and Plaiſter-Babies, which themſelves are ſhortly to be entertain'd withal. Now This Affection is not ſtrictly and properly Humane: Nor ought a Man enrich'd with an Endowment ſo noble as Reaſon, to ſuffer himſelf to be thus enſlav'd to Nature, after the manner of Beaſts that know no better; but rather he ſhou'd be led by theſe Motions of the Soul, and follow them freely, with all that Temper and Evenneſs, which Judgment and Conſideration ſhou'd inſpire; For theſe ſhou'd preſide over Nature, and moderate its Affections, reducing all to the Meaſures and Guidance of Reaſon. But now the other ſort is more agreeable to Theſe, and conſequently more Humane and worthy of us. This inclines us to love our Children more or leſs, as they are more or leſs attractive and deſerving our Affection; to riſe in This as theſe tender Plants of ours Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and Bud; and in proportion to the early Dawnings and brighter and ſtronger Shinings of Wit and good Senſe, Virtue and Goodneſs in them. Some Parents there are, who ſeem wonderfully tranſported with the firſt Appearances of this kind, but loſe the Satisfaction ſoon after, becauſe the Charge of maintaining them at firſt, is no great Matter; but That of the Education, which muſt improve and finiſh them, and bring Credit to their Natural Gifts, is grievous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. This looks as if they grudg'd their Children the Honour and Happineſs of growing wiſer and better, and were ſorry that they anſwer the End of their Creation; A Folly ſo abſurd, ſo infinitely unreaſonable, that we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call them brutiſh and inhumane Fathers who are guilty of it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> Now in purſuance of this Second and properly Paternal Affection, Parents ſhou'd by all means admit their Children, ſo ſoon as they are capable of it, to keep them Company: They ſhou'd make them a competent Allowance fit for the Rank and Condition of them and their Family; ſhou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them into Buſineſs, and let them ſee the World; confer and conſult with them about their own Private Affairs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Deſigns, their Opinions to them, not only as their Companions, but their Friends, and not keep them in Darkneſs, and Strangers to things which they have ſo great an Intereſt in; Theſe ſhou'd conſent to, and even conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to aſſiſt in their becoming and innocent Diverſions, as Occaſions ſhall offer, and ſo far as any of theſe things can conveniently be done; but ſtill ſo as to preſerve all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:53648:599"/>to their own Authority, and the Character of a Parent. For certainly ſuch prudent Reſerves may be us'd in this Caſe, as wou'd in no degree diminiſh That; and yet abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly condemn that ſtern and auſtere, that magiſterial and imperious Countenance and Carriage, which never lets a Child hear one mild Word, nor ſee one pleaſant Look. Men think it now below them to hear of the Relation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to be call'd Fathers; when yet God himſelf does not only condeſcend to, but delight in that Title, above all others whatſoever. They make it no part of their Endeavour or Concern, to win the Love of their Children, but prefer Fear, and Awe, and reſpectful Expreſſions of Diſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Endearments and Teſtimonies of a dutiful and tender Affection. And, to contain them in theſe Sentiments the better, and to confirm them the more, they ſhew their Power by holding their Hands, and denying the Supplies that are neceſſary and ſit for them; make them (as the Term is) <hi>bite of the Bridle,</hi> and not only live like Beggars or Scoundrels at preſent, but threaten to keep them ſo, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Eſtates from them when they die. Now what Stuff is all this? how ſottiſh and ridiculous a Farce do ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple act? What is this but to diſtruſt the Efficacy of that Authority which is real and natural, and of right belongs to the Relation they ſtand in, that ſo they may uſurp a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and unjuſt Juriſdiction, and frame an artificial and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Authority to themſelves? An Authority which all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and good Men do but pity or contemn; nay, which croſſes and contradicts the very End of all this fooliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for they deſtroy that very Reverence they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and render themſelves deſpicable in their own Families, a Jeſt and Scorn even to thoſe Children. But, if it have not this Effect (which it too often hath) of drawing ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them, yet is it a mighty Temptation to young People thus us'd, to take to Tricks, and little diſhoneſt Shifts, and, without the leaſt Remorſe, to cheat and impoſe upon ſuch Parents; Whoſe Buſineſs, indeed, ſhou'd have been to regulate and inform their Minds, and ſhew them the Equity and Reaſonableneſs of their Duty; but by no means to have Recourſe to ſuch kind of Treatment as is much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Arbitrary Violence of a Tyrant, than the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Regards, and kind Care of a Father. What ſays the wiſe Comedian to this purpoſe?

And, if any Inconvenience ſhou'd afterwards happen from ſuch a Diſtribution, it will be much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable to Poſterity, that we have err'd in going by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road, than if it had been by any particular Whimſie of our own. But ſure there cannot be a greater abuſe of the Truſt repos'd in us, and the Liberty we have to diſpoſe of our Fortunes as we pleaſe, than to let little fooliſh Fancies, and frivolous Quarrels, or private Reſentments, weigh down the Obligations of a higher Nature, and either endite, or alter Articles in our Will. And yet how many Inſtances do we ſee of Men, who ſuffer themſelves to be tranſported by a moſt unreaſonable Partiality, and are wrought upon either by ſome little officious Diligence, or the Preſence of one Child when the reſt are Abſent, to make a mighty Difference, where Blood and Duty have never made any at all; who play with their Wills as if it were a jeſting-matter, and gratifie or chaſtiſe ſuch Actions, as do not deſerve ſuch an Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for it ought to be ſomething much more than common, which excludes thoſe who have a juſt Pretence to ſhare in what we leave, or that diſpoſes us to a Diviſion ſo unequal, as ſhould very much affect the Fortunes of our Children, in prejudice to one another, and leave no Mark whereby to know that they were Brothers and Sifters. And if the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus be a Fault, the Threatning at a diſtance, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch an Inequality is highly Wicked and Fooliſh, and of moſt pernicious Influence in the Family: And therefore I ſay ſtill, in deſpight of any ſupportable Defects in our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Flatteries and Officiouſneſs of ſome, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Provocations of others; let us ſit down and conſider
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:53648:600"/>that This, as it is one of the laſt, ſo it is one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and ſerious Actions of our Lives; and therefore Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Law, and common Uſage ought to take place in it. For theſe are the wiſeſt Guides we can follow, and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to Them, we take the ſureſt Gourſe to anſwer the Obligations of our Character, to vindicate our Proceedings to the World, and to quiet and ſatisfie our own Conſciences.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> We are now come to that other general Diviſion of this Chapter, The Duty of Children toward their Parents;<note place="margin">Duty of Children.</note> than which there is not any more plainly and viſibly writ in the Book of Nature, or more expreſly and poſitively enjoyn'd by Religion: A Duty which ought to be paid them, not as mere and common Men, but as a ſort of Demy-Gods, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and viſible Deities in this Mortal Fleſh. Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew tells us, that the Fifth Commandment was written half of it in the Firſt, and the other half in the Second Table of the Decalogue: Becauſe it in part regards the Duty we owe to God, and in part That which we owe to our Neighbour. This is likewiſe ſo ſelf-evident and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a Duty, ſo ſtrictly and indiſpenſably requir'd at our Hands, that No other Duty, no other Affection can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede it; even tho' our Affection to other Perſons may, and is allow'd to be more intimate and tender. For put the Caſe, that a Man hath a Father and a Son both involv'd in the ſame Diſtreſs, and that he have it in his Power to relieve but one of them, it hath been the Opinion of very wiſe Men, that he is bound to aſſiſt his Father, notwithſtanding his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Son, (according to what hath been lately urg'd upon that Occaſion,) be the greater and ſtronger. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which Reſolution ſeems to be, That the Son's Debt to the Father is of longer ſtanding; and the Obligation bore Date, and was in Force before that to his own Son; and that therefore it is in this, as in other Caſes of like Nature, where no antecedent Tie can be cancell'd by any Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Debt contracted afterwards.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Now this Duty principally conſiſts in Five Particulars; All of which are comprehended under that ſignificant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Honouring our Father and Mother.</p>
                              <p>The Firſt is Reverence; by which we are to underſtand, not only thoſe External Reſpects of the Looks, or Geſtures, or Behaviour, but the Inward and Reſpectful Senſe of the Mind; and This indeed chiefly as the Source and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other. Now This conſiſts in a high Eſteem, and proſound Veneration for them, looking upon them as the Authors and Original of our Being, and all the Comforts of
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:53648:600"/>it. The Inſtruments and Immediate Cauſes which the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Father of all things was pleas'd to make choice of, for the bringing us out of Nothing, and making us what we are; and therefore in that Quality bearing a very great Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to God himſelf.</p>
                              <p>The Second is Obedience; Which, provided the Matter of the Command be lawful, cannot be diſpens'd with, upon the Pretence of any Rigour or Hardſhip that it is encumber'd with. And thus we find the <hi>Rechabites</hi> commended by God himſelf, for complying with the Severities of Life,<note place="margin">Jer. xxxv.</note> impoſed upon Them, and their Poſterity, by <hi>Jonadab</hi> their Anceſtor.</p>
                              <p>The Third is, Succouring them in all their Exigencies and Diſtreſſes; maintaining and cheriſhing them in their Wants and Weakneſſes; Old Age and Sickneſs, Infirmities and Poverty muſt be ſo far from Provoking our Scorn and Contempt, that they are but ſo many louder Calls, and more engaging Ties to Love and Duty, to Aſſiſtance and Reſpect; aiding and adviſing them in their Buſineſs, and exerting our utmoſt Power to do them Service. Of This we have ſome wonderful Examples in the other Parts of Nature; and Brutes themſelves have ſet us a noble and almoſt inimitable Pattern; particularly the Stork, which St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſo elegantly extols upon this account: For the young Storks are ſaid to nouriſh and feed the old ones; to cover them with their Feathers when the Shedding of their own expoſes them to the Injuries of Cold and Weather; to fly in couples, and join Wings to carry them on their Backs. Nature, it ſeems, inſpiring them with this Artificial Contrivance of ſhewing this Piety and Affection. This Example is ſo lively, ſo very moving, that the Duty of Parents to their Children hath been expreſs'd in ſome Tranſlations by <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>, that is, <hi>acting the Part of a Stork.</hi> And the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in cohſideration of this eminent Quality, call this Bird <hi>Chaſida,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Kind, Charitable, Good-Natur'd.</hi> Some very remarkable Inſtances of this kind among Men, we read in ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. <hi>Tymon,</hi> Son to the Great <hi>Miltiades,</hi> when his Father was dead in Priſon, and ſo poor that he had not wherewith to bury him, (tho' ſome ſay it was for the Payment of his Debts, for failure whereof his Corpſe was arreſted, and kept above-ground) ſold himſelf, and ſacrific'd his Liberty, for a Summ of Money, to be expended in defraying the Charges of the Funeral. This Man did not contribute to his Father's Neceſſities out of his own Abundance, or his actual Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but parted with his Freedom; a Juying dearer to him and eſteem'd more valuable, than either Fortune, or Life it
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:53648:601"/>ſelf for his Father's Sake. He did not relieve him alive and, in diſtreſs; but when he was dead, no longer his Father, no longer a Man. What a Brave, what an Heroick Act was this? What may we reaſonably imagine, ſo gallant a Son would have done, what indeed would he not have done for a living and a neceſſitous Father, One that had asked, or that had needed his Aſſiſtance? This is a generous and a glorious Inſtance of the Duty now under Conſideration. We are likewiſe told of Two Examples in the weaker Sex, Women who ſuckled, the One her Father, and the Other her Mother, when they were Priſoners under Sentence of Condemnation, and to be famiſhed to Death; which is ſaid to have been heretofore a Puniſhment very commonly inflicted in Capital Caſes. It looks a little Unnatural for a Mother to Subſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Daughter's Milk; This is turning the Stream back again up to the Fountain-Head; but ſure it deſerves to be conſidered by the Ladies of Our Age; how very Natural, indeed how Fundamental and Primitive a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, for Mothers to ſuckle, and give that Suſtenance, which Nature hath provided on purpoſe to their own Children.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Duty is, To be governed and directed by them in all Matters of Moment; to attempt no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Thing without taking their Advice, and asking their Conſent, and being confirmed in our Intentions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, by the Parents Approbation and good Liking. This is a general Rule, extending to all the important Affairs of Humane Life; All that are fit to trouble and conſult them about; but it hath a ſpecial Regard to the Diſpoſing of themſelves in Marriage, which is of all others the moſt Weighty and Serious; and ſuch as Parents have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar right to be well informed of, and perfectly ſatisfied in.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, Covering their Vices and Imperfections; ſubmitting to their Humors and Paſſions; their Severity and hard Uſage; and bearing all their moſt unreaſonable Peeviſhneſs, and angry Rebukes with Patience and Temper. Of This we have a notable Inſtance in <hi>Manlius Pomponius.</hi> The Tribune had accuſed the Father of this <hi>Manlius</hi> to the People, of ſeveral grievous Crimes; among the reſt of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Barbarity to his Son; and among other Indignities, that he forc'd him to dig and drive the Plough. This Son went to this Tribune's Houſe; found him in Bed; and, putting a Knife to his Throat, made him ſwear that he would withdraw the Indictment, and proſecute his Father 10 farther; declaring that he had rather ſubmit to the moſt
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:53648:601"/>Slaviſh Drudgery his Father could impoſe upon him, and toil at it all the Days of his Life, than ſee him proſecuted and expoſed for any rigorous Carriage to him.</p>
                              <p>Theſe <hi>Five</hi> Duties, at firſt Sight, may perhaps ſeem too Rigid, but there is no Child, who would not allow them to be very reaſonable and becoming him to pay, did he but give himſelf the Trouble of conſidering ſeriouſly, how much he hath ſtood his Parents in. What Pain and Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what Tender Care and Concern, what Trouble and Expence, and what a World of Affection went to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him up. But This in Truth is a Computation which no Man is capable of making juſtly, till he come to have Children of his own; Then Matters will appear to him quite otherwiſe, than now they do. And therefore, as the Philoſopher, who was found riding upon a Hobby-Horſe with his little Boy, deſired that his Friend would forbear to expoſe that Levity of his, till he was a Father himſelf: So in the Caſe before us, whoever ſhall imagine, that the Duty to Parents is carried beyond Equity and Reaſon, or Their Merits to their Children over-rated here, we muſt beg that he will be content to ſuſpend his Final Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Matter, till that Time come, which alone can make him a competent Judge of it.</p>

                              <p>THere remains now only the Third and Laſt Part of Private and Domeſtick Juſtice to be ſpoken to, which conſiſts of the mutual Duties of that loweſt Relation, between Maſters and Servants.</p>
                              <p>Now, in Order to a right Underſtanding of this Matter, we muſt remember, that there are different Sorts of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and more eſpecially theſe <hi>Three</hi> that follow. The <hi>Firſt</hi> are, what we call Slaves, in which all the World abounded heretofore, and the greateſt Part of it does ſo ſtill; for except one Quarter of <hi>Europe,</hi> they are ſtill reckoned as part of their Maſters Riches and Eſtate: And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have no Right in any Thing, not ſo much as in their Goods, their Children, or their own Bodies; but their Patron hath an abſolute Power, to buy and ſell them, to give them, or barter them away; and to deal by them in
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:53648:602"/>as Arbitrary and Uncontrouled a Manner, as We do with our Horſes, or Cattel, or any Beaſts of Service. Of theſe we have delivered our Opinion at large in the firſt Book. The Next are,<note place="margin">Book I. Chap. 43.</note> what we commonly call Servants or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; Theſe are Free-Men, and have a Right Inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their own Perſons and Poſſeſſions; nay, they have ſuch an indefeaſible Liberty, that it cannot be taken away from them, by any Voluntary Compact of their own, or any other Means uſed in Prejudice of it. But they are bound to Pay Honor and Reſpect, Obedience and Service, for ſo long a Time, and upon ſuch Conditions, as have been covenanted for; and their Maſters accordingly have a Power of commanding, correcting, and puniſhing them, within the Bounds of Moderation and Diſcretion. The <hi>Third</hi> Sort are, what we may term Hirelings, or Workmen; which are ſtill leſs in Subjection than the Former: For they are not obliged to Attendance, nor Obedience in general; but only to the Performance of that Particular Work, we take them for; and ſo they only make an Exchange of their Labour and Induſtry, for ſo much of our Money; for thoſe that Hire them, have no Authority either to correct them for doing amiſs, or to command them at large in any other Thing.</p>
                              <p>Now, The Duty of Maſters towards their Servants, whether in the Quality of Slaves, or of Attendants, is; Not to uſe them Barbarouſly, but always to remember, that Theſe too are Men; of the very ſame Species with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves, made up of the ſame Materials, caſt in the ſame Mould; deſcended from the ſame Anceſtors. That it is not Nature, which hath put any Difference, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fortune; and Fortune is a very Humorſom and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thing, for the ſeems to make her ſelf great Diverſion with her Wheel; and to triumph in turning thoſe that were at the Bottom up to the Top, and tumbling thoſe that ſat at the Top, down to the Bottom. Conſequently, that the Diſtinction is not ſo great, as they are willing to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; nor what can bear them out in keeping their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows at ſo vaſt a diſtance; and expecting ſuch wonderful Submiſſions from them.

                              <p>The Duty of Servants is to Honour and fear their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with regard to this Relation between them; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be, or how little ſoever they may deſerve ſuch Deference in any other reſpects. To obey them Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Diligently; to be true to their Truſt; to ſerve, not only in Appearance, and while the Maſter's Eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; but Sincerely, Seriouſly, and Cordially; out of a Principle of Conſcience, and without the leaſt mixture of Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation. To ſow no Diſcord, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Jealouſies and Diſcontents in the Family; to keep Secrets; not to turn Whiſperers or Hearkeners, or buſie Bodies; not divulging what is done at Home to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their Maſter; but advancing his Intereſt, and vindicating his Reputation; as well as aſſiſting and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Perſon, ſo far as lies in their Power. And indeed there are ſeveral very Noble, and Generous, and Brave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances upon Record of eminent Things done by Servants for their Maſters; nay, ſome of them have gone ſo far, as to hazard their own, for the ſaving their Maſters Life, or the doing Right to their Honour.</p>

Now, the Piety, which concerns us to obſerve in this Place, is conſequently not ſo much the Perſonal, as the Publick and Princely Acts of it; The Care and Regard he ought to have for the Preſervation and Security of the Eſtabliſhed Religion; making ſeaſonable Proviſion for its Protection and Defence by wholeſome and wiſe Laws; ordering and inflicting ſevere Penalties, upon the Poiſoners and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and taking all poſſible Care, that neither the Doctrines and Myſteries of it be reviled and blaſphemed, nor the Rights of it violated, nor the Exerciſe of it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and confounded by Fickle and Factious Men. This is a Care, that will conduce mightily to his Honour, and the Security of his own Perſon and Government: For Men are naturally diſpoſed to ſtand in greater Awe of, and pay a more willing Obedience to a Governour, who (they are
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:53648:603"/>continued) does truly fear God. They are more Fearful and Cautious in forming any Attempts againſt ſuch a one, becauſe the Natural Notions of a Superintending Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, repreſent him to Mankind, as one under the more ſpecial and immediate Care of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Una cuſtodia Pietas.

                                 <hi>Piety</hi> (ſays an old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>is one ſtrong Guard. All the Malice of the Evil Genius, and all the Strength of Fate are not able to take any hold on the Pious Man; For his God delivers him from all Evil.</hi> Nor is this a Safeguard to his Perſon only, but to his Country and Government alſo; for all the Philoſophers and wiſe Men are unanimouſly agreed, that Religion is the Strongeſt Tye, the cloſeſt and moſt binding Cement of Human Society, and mutual Commerce.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Prince is alſo bound to pay a ſtrict and inviolable Obedience to the Laws of God; and to enforce the ſame Obedience and Religious Obſervance upon other People: For theſe Laws are Indiſpenſable and Eternal; and he, who endeavours the reverſing, or (which as to the Effect is almoſt the ſame thing) the bringing them into publick Neglect and Contempt, is not only a Tyrant, but a Monſter.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As to the People under his Juriſdiction; he is oblig'd, firſt of all faithfully and punctually to keep his Promiſes, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and Treaties, whether theſe Engagements were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into with his own Subjects as Parties; or whether with any other, that have an Intereſt in them. This is a Branch of Natural and Univerſal Equity; even God himſelf, who is above all Law but that of his own moſt Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, declares himſelf bound by, and always true to his Promiſes. <hi>Hath he ſaid it, and ſhall be not do it?</hi> and <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lye, or the Sun of Man that be ſhould repent: Behold I the Lord have ſaid it, I will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring it to paſs.</hi> Theſe are the Characters given us of Himſelf, by <hi>the God that cannot lie,</hi> in Holy Scripture. And it would ill become his Image upon Earth, to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from that Great Pattern above; and be changed into the Reſemblance of Him, who is the Father of Lyes. But, beſides the Obligations to Truth in this Reſpect, A Prince is the Security, the formal Guarantee for the Laws and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agreements between his Subjects; and he is to ſee that they proceed in all their private Tranſactions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Juſtice and Truth. His Engagement therefore to keep his Word is ſuperiour and more binding, than that of
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:53648:604"/>any other Man can poſſibly be; for there is not any Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Crime poſſible for a Prince to be guilty of, ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deteſtable, as the violating his Word, and his Oath. Upon which Account it hath been obſerved, that when ever a Prince goes counter to his Promiſe, we are to ſuppoſe him controuled and over-powerd by ſome extraordinary Accident or Exigence: For to imagine him falſe to his Engagements, without invincible Neceſſity, were to entertain a Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inconſiſtent with the Reverence due to ſo high a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. Nor is he bound by his own Promiſes and Covenants only; but likewiſe by thoſe of his Predeceſſors; if he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded into their Right by Inheritance; or any other Way that declar'd him ſatisfied to take the Crown as he found it; or if they be ſuch as manifeſtly contribute to the Publick Safety and Advantage. In ſhort, by the ſame Reaſon, and upon the ſame Accounts, he may diſcharge himſelf of all the unreaſonable and prejudicial Promiſes, with Regard to his People; that private Perſons think ſufficient to diſengage Them from, when They ſtand bound to their Prince.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Again, Princes, even the moſt Abſolute of them All, ought to conſider, that although the Law, (the Civil and Human Law I mean) be their own Handy-work, and proper Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, changed and abrogated at Pleaſure, (for this Legiſlative Power is the peculiar Right and diſtinguiſhing Character of Sovereignty,) and ſo, in that reſpect, they are above the Law, as the Creator is above his Creature; yet ſo long as any Law ſtands unrepealed, and in full Force, they are bound in all Equity and good Conſcience, to make it the Rule and Standard of their Actions and Determinations: And it would be an infinite Blemiſh and Diſhonour to themſelves, as well as of ill Example and pernicious Conſequence to others, if they ſhould do otherwiſe: For This were to refuſe to ſtand to their own Act and Deed; a living in perfect Contradiction, and giving the Lye to themſelves. The Great <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had like to have died with Remorſe, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once upon Occaſion done in his own Perſon, a thing contrary to Law; <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> have left us very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Examples of this kind, and paid very dear for them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Prince is a Debtor to his People, for the regular Adminiſtration of Juſtice; and ought upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to make This the Meaſure of his Power, and not to ſtretch beyond the Line. This indeed is the Peculiar Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Prince; a truly Royal and diſtinguiſhing Virtue. Upon which Account, it was both ſmartly and pertinently replyed by an old Woman to King <hi>Philip;</hi> upon his putting
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:53648:604"/>her off, upon Pretence that he was not at Leiſure to do her Right; That if he could not ſpare time to do the Duty of his Office, he ought to lay it down, and be a King no longer. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> did not come off ſo eaſily upon the like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: For upon his throwing ſeveral of their Petitions into the River, without ever returning any Anſwer to them, or redreſſing the Grievances they complained of, they thought themſelves at Liberty to take an other Courſe, and Dethron'd that King, who had expreſt ſuch an haughty Diſregard, to his People, and their Addreſſes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Once more. He ought to love and to cheriſh, to take a very tender Care of his Subjects; and imitate the King of Kings, in watching over them for their Good: His Affection and his Deportment ought to be That of a Husband to the Wife of his Boſom: His Bowels and provident Concern, Thoſe of a Father to his Children; His Vigilance, That of a Shepherd over his Flock, conſtantly keeping in his Eye the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Security of his People, and making Their Eaſe, and Quiet, and Welfare, the Aim and End of all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. The Happineſs of the Country is the Satisfaction and Joy of a good King; the Strength, the Wealth, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Virtue of his People are his chief Deſire and Delight. That Prince, who looks no farther than himſelf and his own Intereſt, abuſes and impoſes upon himſelf: For he is none of his own, nor is the State for Him, but He for the State. He is indeed the Maſter and the Governor of it; but not to the Intent that he ſhould domineer and Tyrannize over it, but that, by the Advantage of ſo great a Power, he may be enabled to ſupport and maintain it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cui non Civium ſervitus tradita, ſed tutela.</note> The People are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, not as an abſolute Poſſeſſion, and to make them Slaves; but as a Truſt, to be their Guardian; and to uſe them like ſo many Minors under his Direction; to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and breed, and watch over them. That by virtue of his Vigilant Care, his Subjects may ſleep ſecurely; that in his Toil and Fatigues they may find Eaſe and Leiſure; that his Induſtry may preſerve their Properties and Pleaſures, and that every Man under his Juriſdiction may know and feel experimentally, that he is as much for their Advantage as he is above them in Dignity and Power.</p>

                              <p>Now, In Order to the Being ſo indeed, and the Effectual diſcharge of this important Truſt, it will be Neceſſary for him to govern himſelf by the Rules, which have been laid down at large in the Second and Third Chapter of this Book.
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:53648:605"/>That is, To be ſufficiently provided, with a wiſe Counſel, a ſubſtantial Exchequer, and a convenient Strength of Forces at Home; and with ſignificant Alliances and Friends abroad. To manage this Proviſion to the beſt Advantage; and ſo to act and Rule, both in Peace and War, that he may reign in the Hearts of his People, and be both loved and feared by them at the ſame time.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To be ſhort, and ſay all in a Word; The Character of a truly good King is compounded of theſe following Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. He muſt fear and reverence his Maſter, Almighty God, above all; he muſt be prudent and conſiderate in his Deſigns; Vigorous and Bold in the Execution of them; Firm in his Reſolutions; True to his Word; Wiſe and Diſcerning in his Counſel; tender of his Subjects; aſſiſting to his Friends; formidable to his Enemies; compaſſionate to thoſe in Diſtreſs; Courteous and Kind to Good Men; a Terror to the Wicked; and Juſt to all.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The Duty of Subjects towards their Prince, conſiſts of <hi>Three</hi> Particulars. The <hi>Firſt,</hi> is Honour and Reverence; And This is due to Princes, in regard they are the Image and Similitude of the moſt High God; eſtabliſhed and ordained by him; and therefore Thoſe, who diſparage and detract from them, that revile or ſpeak ill of them, and endeavour to ſow Diſcords and diſcontented Thoughts, by virulent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, or wicked Scandals, are very highly to be blamed. Theſe are indeed the true Deſcendents, of Prophane and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful <hi>Ham;</hi> who either invent and contrive, or at leaſt expoſe and deride their Father's Shame. The <hi>Second</hi> is, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; which is a Word of very extenſive ſignification, and includes ſerving them in the Wars, paying the Taxes and Tributes impoſed by Their Authority, and the like. The <hi>Third</hi> is, Heartily Deſiring their Happineſs and Proſperity, and recommending Them, and Their Undertakings to the Bleſſing and Protection of Almighty God, in conſtant and ſervent Prayers for them.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But a very conſiderable Doubt ariſes upon this Occaſion; which is, Whether all theſe Duties are to be paid to all Princes without any Diſtinction; whether wicked Princes, whether Tyrants have a Right to them? This Controverſie cannot be decided by any ſingle poſitive Anſwer; but to come to a true Reſolution of the Point, we muſt ſtate the Caſe, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Circumſtances cautiouſly: For a Prince may be Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical either at the very Entrance into his Power, or in the Exerciſe of it afterwards; that is, He may uſurp his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or he may abuſe that Rightful one which he is fairly
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53648:605"/>poſſeſt of. If his Entrance upon the Government be Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical; that is, If he invade without any juſt Pretenſion, be he otherwiſe a Good or a Bad Governour, it matters not much; It hath been the general Senſe of Wiſe Men, that he ought to be withſtood by Methods of Juſtice and legal Redreſs, if there be any opportunity of obtaining Redreſs that way; but if there be not, then by open Force. And indeed I take it, that where we meet with the Word <hi>Tyrant</hi> in old Authors, who uſe it in an ill Senſe, it ought conſtantly to be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, that among the Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> there were particular Honours and Rewards aſſign'd to thoſe who diſtinguiſh'd themſelves by ſuch Deliverances of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from a lawleſs Yoke. Nor can This in any good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech be call'd Reſiſting one's Prince, ſince it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes him never to have been ſo, either in Right or in Fact; but only One who put himſelf upon the People, without ever being receiv'd, or recogniz'd as ſuch. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Caſe is different, if this Tyranny be charg'd upon the Exerciſe and Adminiſtration of his Power only; That is, If he be duly poſſeſs'd of his Power, but uſe it unduly; if he be Cruel, or Wicked, which in the modern Language is, Tyrannical and Arbitrary. And here again we muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to another Diſtinction, to help us to a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Caſe: For a Prince may be Tyrannical in this Senſe of the Word, three ſeveral ways; and a different ſort of Behaviour is requir'd from Subjects, with regard to each of them.</p>
                              <p>Firſt he may be ſo, by violating the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, acting contrary to the eſtabliſh'd Religion of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the expreſs Commands of God, or the Native Liberty of Men's Conſciences. In this Caſe we muſt by no means o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, according to the Maxims laid down in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Men; and to fear Him who hath power over the whole Man, more than Him who hath power over one part of the Man only, and that the leſs, and more inconſiderable part of him too.</hi> But then, if we can have no Relief by Law or Juſtice, we muſt not have Recourſe to Violence; which is the contrary Extreme to a ſinful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but keep the middle Way, which is to flee or to ſuffer.</p>
                              <p>The Second Caſe is not quite ſo bad as the former, becauſe it offers no Violence to the Conſciences of Men, but to their Bodies and Eſtates only, by abuſing his Subjects, reſuſing to do them Juſtice, taking away the Liberty of their Perſons, and the Property of their Eſtates. And here the three Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mention'd before, Honour and Obedience, good Wiſhes
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:53648:606"/>and Prayers ought ſtill to be paid, with Patience and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a Senſe and Acknowledgment of the Wrath of God let looſe upon them in this Scourge of an Unjuſt Prince: For there are Three Conſiderations fit to be attended to upon ſuch Occaſions. One is, <hi>That all Power is of God, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God.</hi>
                                 <note n="*" place="bottom">Principi ſummum Rerum judicium Dii dederunt: Subditis obſequii gloria relicta eſt. Bonos Principes voto expetere, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcunque tolerare.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Gods,</hi> (ſays a very wiſe and judicious Heathen) <hi>have committed the Supreme Judgment, and laſt Determination of Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to the Prince: The Glory of Obedience is the Subject's Portion; we muſt therefore wiſh and pray that we may have none but Good Princes; but when we have them, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them whether they be Good or Bad.</hi> The Ground and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reaſon of our Obedience does not lie in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Perſonal Virtues, or juſt and commendable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, but in their Character, and Superiority over us. There is a vaſt difference between True and Good; and he who is truly our Governour, tho' he be not a good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is to be regarded as the Laws themſelves are; which bind us, not upon the Account of their Juſtice or Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but purely upon the Account of their being Laws, and having the Sanction that is requiſite to give them Authority. A Second Reflection upon this Occaſion ſhou'd be. That God permits Hypocrites, and ſets up wicked Men to bear Rule for the Sins of a People, and in the Day of his fierce Anger. He makes a barbarous unjuſt Prince the Inſtrument of his Vengeance; and therefore This muſt be born with the ſame Temper of Mind with which we ſubmit to other Calamities made uſe of by God for that Purpoſe:<note n="†" place="bottom">Quomodo Sterilitatem, aut nimios Imbres, &amp; caetera Naturae mala, ſic Luxum &amp; Avaritiam Dominantium tolerare.</note> 
                                 <hi>Like a Blaſt, or a Barren Year, Inundations and exceſſive Rains, or other Evils in the Courſe of Nature, ſo ſhou'd the Avarice and Luxury of Princes be endur'd by thoſe they oppreſs,</hi> ſays <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Inſtances of this kind we have in <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Time; and ſome others, as wicked Tyrants as was poſſible for them to be, and yet Good Men paid them theſe Three Duties notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and were commanded ſo to do by the Prophets and Preachers of thoſe Times; in Agreement to our Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Oracle of Truth it ſelf, who directs his Diſciples to <hi>obey thoſe that ſat in Moſes's Chair;</hi> tho' in the ſame Breath
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53648:606"/>he charges thoſe very Governours with Wickedneſs and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, with <hi>binding heavy Burdens,</hi>

                              </p>
                              <p>The Third Caſe concerns the State in general, when the very Fundamentals of Government are endeavour'd to be torn up, or over-turn'd; when he goes about to change, or to take away the Conſtitution; as if, for Inſtance, a Prince wou'd make that which is Elective, Hereditary; or from an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, or Democracy, or any other ſuch mixt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wou'd engroſs all to himſelf, and make it an Abſolute Monarchy; or in any other Caſe like or equivalent to theſe, ſhall attempt to alter the State from what it was formerly, and ought to continue; In this Caſe Men may and ought to withſtand him, and to hinder any ſuch Attempts from taking place upon them, and That, either by Methods of Legal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or otherwiſe: For a Prince is not the Maſter and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Conſtitution, but the Guardian and Conſervator of it. But then, This muſt be done regularly too; for the ſetting ſuch Matters right does not belong to all the Subjects indifferently; but to thoſe who are the Truſtees of the State, or have the Principal Intereſt in it. Who theſe are, the Conſtitutions of the reſpective Countries muſt determine: In Elective Kingdoms, the Electors; in others, the Princes of the Blood; In Republicks, and thoſe Places which have Fundamental Laws, the States-General aſſembled: And This I conceive to be the only Caſe which can juſtifie Subjects in reſiſting a Tyrant in this Second Senſe of the Word, with regard to the Exerciſe of his Power, and the Pretence of Male-Adminiſtration. What I have hitherto deliver'd upon this laſt Caſe is meant <hi>of Subjects;</hi> that is, of Thoſe who are not permitted in any Circumſtances, or upon any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to attempt any thing againſt their Sovereign; of Them, I ſay, who are by the Laws declar'd guilty of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crime, if they ſhall but Counſel, or compaſs, or ſo much as imagine the Death of their King. And if ſo much be allowable to Men under theſe Obligations and Penalties, then, no doubt, it is lawful, nay, it is highly commendable and a glorious Action in a Stranger, or Foreign Prince, to take up Arms, for the Defence and Revenge of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, labouring under unjuſt Oppreſſion: To redreſs their Wrongs, and deliver them from the heavy Yoke of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; as we find <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Time, and afterwards <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and not long ſince <hi>Tamerlane</hi> Prince of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who defeated <hi>Bajazet</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor at the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                              </p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Such is the State of a Subject's Duty to his Prince, during his Life-time; but when Princes are dead, it is but an Act of Juſtice to examine into their Actions. It is indeed a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary thing ſo to do, and a very reaſonable and uſeful Cuſtom no doubt it is. The Nations that obſerve it, find mighty Benefit from this Practice; and all good Princes will have reaſon to encourage and deſire it; becauſe thus that common Complaint wou'd be quite taken away, that all Princes are treated alike, and that there is no Diſtinction ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in our Reſpects to the Memory of the Good and the Bad. Kings are the Law's Fellows, if they be not their Maſters: And the Revenge, which Juſtice will not permit to be taken upon their Perſons, it is but ſitting that it ſhou'd take upon their Reputation, and the Eſtates of their Succeſſors. We owe Subjection and Obedience to all Kings alike; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe This is an Obligation annex'd to their Offices, and payable purely upon that Conſideration; but we cannot be accountable for our Affection and Eſteem to all alike, becauſe Theſe will depend upon their Qualities, and are due only to their Merits and Virtue. Let us then reſolve patiently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure even the worſt and moſt unworthy, while we have them; let us endeavour to cover and conceal the Vices of the Living, for this is what Reſpect to their Authority requires from us; and beſides, the Weight and Difficulty of their Charge, and the Preſervation of Publick Peace and Order, challenge our joint Endeavours, and ſtand in need of the utmoſt we can poſſibly do to ſupport them. But when they are withdrawn, and gone off the Stage, it wou'd be hard to deny us a juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of expreſſing our real Thoughts of them, without all that Reſerve. Nay it is an honeſt and a commendable Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern which theſe Proceedings ſet to Poſterity; who cannot but look upon it as a ſingular Commendation of our Obedience and Reſpect, that we were content to pay theſe to a Maſter, whoſe Imperfections we were very well acquainted with. Thoſe Writers, who upon the Account of Perſonal Intereſt, or Obligations, eſpouſe the Memory of a wicked Prince, and ſet it off to the World; do an Act of Private Juſtice at the Expence of the Publick: For to ſerve, or ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grateful, they defraud Mankind of the Truth. This Reflection were an admirable Leſſon for a Succeſſor, if it cou'd be well obſerv'd; and a powerful Check it might be to the Exorbitancies of Power, to think with one's ſelf, that the Time will thortly come, when the World will make us as free with his Character, as they do at preſent with his Predeceſſor's.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THoſe few Wiſe and Good Men, who are Members of the Common-wealth, would doubtleſs be better pleaſed to retire into themſelves, and live at Eaſe; full of that ſweet Content, which excellent and intelligent Perſons know how to give themſelves, in the Contemplation of the Beauties of Nature, and the works of Providence, than to ſacrifice all this ſatisfaction to Buſineſs and a publick Poſt; were it not, that they hope to do ſome good, in being ſerviceable to their Country by their own Endeavours, and in preventing the whole Adminiſtration of Affairs from falling into ill, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful hands. This may and ought to prevail with Perſons of this Character, to conſent to the trouble of being Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: But to cabal and make Parties, and court Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Truſt with Eagerneſs and Paſſion; eſpecially ſuch as are judicial, is a very baſe and ſcandalous Practice; condemned as ſuch by all good Laws, even thoſe of Pagan Republicks, (as the <hi>Julian</hi> Law among the <hi>Romans</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtiſies,) unbecoming a Man of Honour; and the ſhrewdeſt ſign that can be, that the Perſon is unſit for the Truſt he ſeeks ſo vehemently. To buy publick Offices is ſtill more infamous and abominable; the moſt ſordid, the moſt villainous way of Trading in the World: For it is plain, he that buys in the Piece, muſt make himſelf whole by ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out again in Parcels. Which was a good Reaſon for the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> when he was declaring againſt a Fault of this nature, to ſay, <hi>That it was very hard to condemn a Man for making Money of that which he had given Moncy for before.</hi>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Juſt for all the World, as a Man dreſſes, and ſets his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in order and form, putting on his beſt Face before he goes abroad, that he may make a Figure; and appear well in Company; ſo is it ſit that a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No Man is ſo weak, to enter the Laſts with an unmanaged Horſe, or to hazard his Perſon with ſuch a one in any Service of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and Danger; but trains and teaches him firſt,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:53648:608"/>breeds him to his hand, and uſes him to the Exerciſe he is deſigned for: And is there not the ſame reaſon that this wild and reſtiff part of our Soul ſhould be tamed and accuſtomed to bear the Bit? Should be perfectly inſtructed in thoſe Laws and Meaſures which are to be the Rules of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and upon which, the good or ill Conduct of our Lives will depend? Is it not reaſonable, I ſay, That a Man ſhould be Maſter of his own private Behaviour, and expert in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt of every Accident and Occaſion, before he venture out upon the publick Stage; and either give Laws to others, or correct them for the neglect of thoſe they have already? And yet, (as <hi>Socrates</hi> obſerved very truly) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World is quite otherwiſe: For, though no body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to Exerciſe a Trade, to which he hath not been Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and ſerved a long Apprenticeſhip; and how Mean or Mechanical ſoever the Calling be, ſeveral Years are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the Learning of it; Yet in the caſe of publick Adminiſtrations which is of all other Profeſſions the moſt intricate and difficult, (ſo abſurd, ſo wretchedly careleſs are we) that every body is admitted, every body thinks himſelf abundantly qualified to undertake them. Theſe Commiſſions are made Complements and things of Courſe, without any Conſideration of Men's Abilities; or regarding at all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they know any thing of the matter; as if a Man's Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or the having an Eſtate in his Country, could inform his Underſtanding, or ſecure his Integrity, or render him capable of diſcerning between Right and Wrong, and a competent Judge of his Poorer, (but perhaps much honeſter and wiſer) Neighbours.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Magiſtrates have a mixt Quality, and are placed in a middle Station, between ſovereign Princes and private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Theſe Subalterns therefore have a double Task in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon them, and muſt learn both how to Command, and how to Obey. To obey the Princes, who truſt and employ them, to ſubmit to, and truckle under the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Authority of their Superiour Officers; to pay Reſpect to their Equals; to Command thoſe under their Juriſdiction; to Protect and Defend the Poor, and thoſe that are unable to Contend for their own; to ſtand in the Gap, and oppoſe the powerful Oppreſſor; and to diſtribute Right and Juſtice to all Sorts and Conditions of Men whatſoever. And, if this be the Buſineſs of a Magiſtrate, well might it grow into a Proverb, that the Office diſcovers the Man, ſince no mean Abilities, no common Addreſs, can ſuffice for the ſuſtaining
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:53648:608"/>ſo many Characters at once, and to Act each part ſo well, as to merit a general Approbation and Applauſe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As to the Sovereign, by whoſe Commiſſion the Magiſtrates Act, his Commands muſt be the Rule of their Behaviour. Some of his Orders they ought to Execute ſpeedily, ſome again they muſt by no means comply with; or be in any degree inſtrumental in the Execution of them; and in others the moſt adviſeable Courſe will be, to ſuſpend their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for ſome convenient time.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In all Commiſſions, which leave the Cogniſance of the Matter to the Magiſtrate, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> and in all others, where there is this Clauſe, (ſo <hi>far as to you ſhall appear</hi>) or any other Clauſe equivalent to This, inſerted; or which, though they do not refer the Cogniſance to Him, yet order ſuch things, as are either manifeſtly juſt, or at leaſt lawful and indifferent in their own Natures, he ought to obey readily, and without demur; for here is no difficulty, nor any ground at all for a juſt and reaſonable Scruple.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In ſuch Commiſſions and Orders, as do not leave the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of the Matter to Him, but only decree ſome point of Executive Obedience; as in thoſe particularly, which we commonly call Mandates and Warrants; if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any poſitive Law, which the Sovereign hath power to diſpenſe with, and there be Clauſes of Non-Obſtante for that purpoſe, to ſave the Party harmleſs; he is obliged to obey his Orders without more to do. Becauſe, according to the Civil Conſtitution, and the Laws of the Land, the Sovereign hath a Liberty reſerved to him of Relaxing, or ſetting aſide the Law in ſuch particular Caſes. And the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a Power over all Laws whatſoever, is the very thing in which Abſolute and Unlimited Sovereignty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In Caſes contrary to Law, and where no ſuch Diſpenſing Clauſe is inſerted; or ſuch as manifeſtly make againſt the Publick Good, (though there ſhould be an Indemnifying Clauſe) or where the Magiſtrate knows his Orders to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Surpriſes or upon ſalſe Suggeſtions, or by Corrupt Methods; he ought not, in any of theſe three Caſes, to be haſty in the Executing his Orders; but let them lie by a while, and with all Humility Remonſtrate againſt them; And, if Occaſion be, repeat thoſe Remonſtrances a ſecond or a third time; but if the Command be Peremptory, and Unalterable, and repeated as often; then he is to comply ſo
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:53648:609"/>far as in Honour and good Conſcience he may, and for the reſt, to excuſe himſelf, as well as he can.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In Matters contrary to the Law of God and Nature, he muſt lay down his Office, and be content to quit all; nay, reſolve to ſuffer the worſt that can come, rather than be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in, or conſenting to them. I cannot ſo much as allow him to deliberate, or once to doubt, in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, what he ſhould do; For natural Juſtice cannot be hid; it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> All this Advice relates to Things in agitation, and intended or ordered to be done; but, as for thoſe which the Sovereign hath done already, let them be never ſo Wicked and Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, a Man had better diſſemble the Matter as well as he can, and try to wipe out all Remembrance of it, than loſe all, by Provoking, and Expoſtulating with a Prince to no purpoſe; as <hi>Papinian</hi> did. <hi>For</hi>

                                 <hi>it is the very extremity of Midneſs to ſtrive againſt a Stream; where no ground can be get, nor any thing but Hatred and Disfavour for our pains.</hi>

                              <p>As for their Duty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> when conſidered in their other Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and with regard to the private Subjects under their Government, Magiſtrates muſt always remember, whoſe their Authority is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and from whence they derive it. That this is none of their own proper Right, but meerly a Truſt; That they hold it from and under the Prince; That he hath the Fee, and is the Lord and conſtant Proprietor; but they are Tenants and Stewards at will, put in to Exerciſe this part of his Juriſdiction for ſo long a Term only, as their Commiſſion purports; or during his Pleaſure; and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Now from hence it is very natural and obvious to infer.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That a Magiſtrate ought to be eaſie of Acceſs; always ready and at leiſure to hear and receive the Petitions, and Complaints preſerred to him. That his Doors ſhould be open to all Comers, and he as ſeldom out of the way as is poſſible; but eſpecially, not ſo, wilfully and by Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; for he ſhould conſider himſelf, as no longer at his own diſpoſal; but a Servant of the Publick, and devoted
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53648:609"/>to the Uſe and Benefit of other People:<note n="*" place="bottom">Magna ſervitus, magna fortuna.</note> 
                                 <hi>A great Poſt is a great ſlavery.</hi> And this was the reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law Commanded, That the Judges ſhould keep their Seſſions, and decide Controverſies in the Gates of their Cities; that ſo Juſtice might offer it ſelf to all that went in and out, and none might find any difficulty in addreſſing for, or in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He ought to receive the Applications of all Perſons and Conditions alike; and be open and kind to all; the Mean as well as the Great; and the Poor no leſs than the Rich. Upon which account it is, that one of the Philoſophers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Magiſtrate to an Altar; to which all People have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in their Affliction and extream Neceſſity; pour out their Souls there; and depend upon Relief and Conſolation for their Troubles from ſo doing.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But, though in point of Juſtice, he ſhould be free and open, yet in Friendſhips, and Acquaintance he oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For a large and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acquaintance debaſes the Authority of his Character; and abates of that Firmneſs and Vigour, which is neceſſary for the due Diſcharge of it. When <hi>Cleon</hi> was choſen and admitted to the Government, he called all his Friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſolemnly renounced from that time, whatever Friendſhip had been formerly between them; as thinking the continuing under ſuch Engagements, by no means reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Truſt he had now took upon him; and <hi>Cieero</hi> obſerves accordingly, that a Man muſt put off the Character of the Friend, and lay that quite aſide, before he can do Right to the part of a Judge.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> There are two Things, wherein the Office of a Magiſtrate chiefly conſiſts: The One is, to<note n="†" place="bottom">Gerere perſonam civitatis, ejus dignitatem &amp; decus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinere.</note> preſerve and keep up the Honour, and Dignity, and juſt Rights of the Prince, who hath employed him, and of the Publick whoſe Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he is, with a becoming State, with Gravity, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Behaviour, and a well-tempered Severity.</p>
                              <pb n="614" facs="tcp:53648:610"/>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Next, He is to Act like a true and faithful Tranſcript from the Original; an Interpreter and Executor of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Will; to ſee that this be duly declared, and diligently obſerved. By this Will, I mean the Law; for this is the Authentick Will of the Prince, and the only Declaration of it, which Subjects are bound to take notice of. Of this the Magiſtrate is to exact a faithful Account and punctual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance; for which reaſon we often find him termed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>The Living and the Speaking Law.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Now, though it be the Duty of a Magiſtrate, and an excellent Qualification in him, to temper Juſtice with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and Severity with Gentleneſs and Forbearance; yet, it muſt be confeſſed much more for the common Advantage, to have ſuch Magiſtrates as incline to the exceſs of Sharpneſs and Rigour, than thoſe who are diſpos'd to Mildneſs, and Eaſineſs, and Compaſſion. For even God himſelf, who ſo highly recommends, ſo ſtrictly enjoyns all thoſe humane and ſoft Diſpoſitions upon other Occaſions, yet poſitively forbids a Judge to be moved with Pity. The Strict and Harſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is the better Reſtraint, the ſtronger Curb; He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains People in Bounds, and preſerves a due Awe and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Laws. The Mild and Merciful One expoſes the Laws to Contempt; makes Magiſtracy cheap, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens the Prince, who made both the Law and the Magiſtrate, in the Eyes and Eſteem of his People. In one word; There muſt go two Qualifications to the Capacitating a Man for the diſcharging this Office compleatly; Integrity, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The firſt cannot ſubſiſt alone, but ſtands in need of the ſecond to ſupport and back it. The former will be ſure to keep the Magiſtrate's Hands clean from Avarice, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and Reſpect of Perſons; from Bribery and Gifts, which are the Bane and utter Exterminators of Truth; and from any other violation of Juſtice; which <hi>Plato</hi> calls, (what indeed it ought to be) a Pure Unblemiſhed Virgin: This will alſo be a Guard to him againſt his Paſſions; the Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the Affection he may bear to the Parties concerned; and indeed all other Reſentments, which are but ſo many Enemies and Underminers of Right and Equity. But then he will find great occaſion for Courage too, to ſtand his ground againſt the Menaces and Imperious Sollicitations of Great Men, the Requeſts and Importunities of Friends who fanſie they have a ſort of Right to diſpoſe of him, and will not take a reaſonable Reſuſal: To harden him againſt the Prayers and Tears, the loud Cries, and bitter Complaints
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53648:610"/>of the Miſerable and Afflicted; for all theſe are very mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forcible inducements, a great Violence upon Reaſon and Duty; and yet ſo committed, that there is a plauſible appearance of both, in the very Diverſion they labour to give us from both. And the truth is, this firmneſs and inflexible Conſtancy of Mind is the moſt maſterly Virtue, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Excellence of a Magiſtrate; that he neither be terrified and ſubdued by Greatneſs and Power, nor melted by Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and deplorable Circumſtances. Theſe are what very brave Men are often tranſported by; and therefore it is the greater Praiſe to continue Proof againſt them. For, though being ſoftned by the latter have an Air of Good-nature, and is more likely to prevail upon the Better ſort of Men; yer either of the Extreams is ſinful, and both forreign to the merits of the Cauſe, which is the only thing that lies upon the Judge. The Motives to Pity then are very dangerous Temptations; and what a Man in Authority ought as much to ſtop his Ears againſt, as Promiſes or Threatnings; for even that God himſelf, who is Love and Mercy in Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hath diſcountenanced this unſeaſonable Compaſſion. And the ſame Legiſlator, who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not receive a Gift to blind thine Eyes therewith, neither ſhalt thou accept the Perſon of the Mighty,</hi> found it no leſs neceſſary for the Good of Mankind, and the equal Diſtribution of Juſtice, no leſs agreeable to his own Goodneſs, to add that other Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not favour a Poor Man in his Cauſe.</hi>

                              <p>THE Duty of Perſons of Honour and Quality conſiſts principally in theſe two Points. The lending a ſtrong and powerful Aſſiſtance to the Publick; employing their Wealth, their Intereſt, their Blood, in the Maintenance and Preſervation of Piety and Juſtice; of the Prince and the Government, and in general, of the common ſafety and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For they are the Pillars and Supporters, upon which theſe noble Structures ſtand; and by which they muſt be ſuſtained. The other Branch conſiſts in being a mighty Defence and Protection to the Poor and Needy, the Injured and Oppreſſed; by interpoſing their Power on the behalf of ſuch, ſtanding
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:53648:611"/>between Them and Ruin, and giving a Check and Diverſion to the Violence of wicked and unreaſonable Men. Perſons of Honour in a State, ſhould be like the Spirits and good Blood in our Bodies, which always run to the wounded, and the ailing part. It was this, that rendered <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo proper to be made the Captain of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation; and the Scripture takes expreſs notice of his Zeal in revenging the Injuries of one of his Brethren who ſuffered Wrong,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>7.</hi>
                                 </note> and ſlaying the inſolent <hi>Aegrptian;</hi> as a Sign, that God had Marked him out for a Deliverer of his People. Thus <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was Deiſted among the Heathens, for being a Scourge to the Cruelty of Tyrants, and a Refuge to thoſe that were Oppreſs'd, and opprobriouſly Treated by them. And thoſe other renouned Names in Antiquity, who followed his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, have always been looked upon as Heroes, and ſomething more than Men. Particular Honours and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Rewards were heretofore awarded to all ſuch; as to Perſons, who deſerved exceeding well of the Publick; and for an Intimation, That no Character is more glorious, none more attractive of Univerſal Admiration, and profound Reſpect, than that of being a Succour to the Afflicted, and Abuſed; and helping thoſe, who were in no condition of helping themſelves. It is by no means true Greatneſs, to appear formidable to any part of Mankind, except one's Enemies only. The affectation to have others ſtand in Awe, and Dread, and to Tremble before one, is a mean and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temper; and, at the ſame time that it renders the Man a Terrour, it renders him an Odium too; a publick Nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and a common Enemy. Love in this caſe is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, than even Adoration could be without it. Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Men betray a fierce and haughty, a proud and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Diſpoſition. This is it, which makes them ſo Contumelious and Diſdainful; ſcorning their Inſeriours, as if they were no better than the Droſs and Dung of the World; and not Men of the ſame Nature with their own Great Selves. From hence, by degrees they degenerate into Barbarity and Inſolence; abuſing all beneath them, without the leaſt Pity or Remorſe; enſlaving their Perſons; invading their Properties and Poſſeſſions; as if Humanity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were intended only for the Benefit of them who need it leaſt; and as if they had no right to any thing, who cannot right themſelves. All this is infinitely diſtant from true Greatneſs; and utterly inconſiſtent with Generoſity and a Noble Mind; for theſe never diſpoſe a Man to Cruelty or
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:53648:611"/>Contempt; but are a Safeguard and Defence, and delight in Offices of Courteſie, and Condeſcenſion, of Charity, and Mercy.</p>
                              <p>The Duty of Mean and Inſeriour Perſons towards thoſe that are above them, is likewiſe Two-fold. Firſt, That of Honour and Reſpect; and this, not confined meerly to the outward Behaviour, and the viſible Marks of a Ceremonious diſtance; (which is due upon the account of their Quality and Rank in the World, conſidered abſtractedly, and by it ſelf. Be they in themſelves what they will in other reſpects, their Virtues or their Vices make no difference in the Caſe;) But there is likewiſe an internal Honour, the real Eſteem and Affection of the Heart, which muſt conſtantly attend and put forward the other, if they be deſerving Perſons, and lovers of the publick Good. Honour and Eſteem are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore capable of very dirſerent Senſes; They are both due to ſuch as are Good, for ſuch indeed are all that are truly Great Men. To thoſe who want this ſubſtantial Character of Quality; we muſt pay the Civilities of the Cap and the Knee; our Bodies may and ought to bow to them, but our Hearts cannot; for this is done only by paying them our Love and Eſteem.</p>
                              <p>The other part of this Duty conſiſts in endeavouring to pleaſe, and be in their good Graces, by reſpectful and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Tenders of our Service.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we cannot make them our Friends, we ſhould be ſure to take care that they may not be our Enemies; which Care too muſt be as Prudent, as it is Neceſſary; and rightly tempered with Moderation and Diſeretion. For nothing is more nauſeous, than a Cringing Fawning Coxcomb, and exceſſive Officiouſneſs does more harm than good. He that declines the Diſpleaſure of a great Man, with too ſollicitous a Caution; or tries to wriggle into his favour by impertinent and unſeaſonable Addreſſes, does not only diſcover his own weakneſs and deſpicable littleneſs of Soul; but he likewiſe miniſters juſt occaſion of Jealouſie and Offence; and ſecretly accuſes his Patron of Cruelty or Injuſtice. And therefore what is done of this kind muſt be unſeen, and by the by.<note n="†" place="bottom">Non ex profeſſo cavere aut fugere; nam quem quis fugit, damnut.</note>

For many times Men take a Pride to cruſh and inſult over the fearful and ſuſpicious; and mean unworthy Submiſſions do but provoke a more extravagant and remorſeleſs Barbarity.</p>

                           <hi>THE two Virtues, which have been inſiſted upon hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, are a Rule to Men, conſidered as Members of Society; and regard their Deportment, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; their Intereſts and Obligations with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Theſe two that follow are to govern them within, and for themſelves. They look upon Fortune in her two different Aſpects, Proſperity and Adverſity; which are general Terms for all the good or ill Accidents of humane Life; and the proviſion made againſt them, is to arm the Mind by Fortitude againſt Adverſity, and in Proſperity to balaſt, and moderate it by Temperance. Both theſe Virtues might indeed be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the general notion of Conſtancy; which is a tight and even firmneſs, or ſteadineſs of Soul, in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of outward Accidents or Occurrences, ſo that the Man is neither elevated and tranſported upon the account of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor dejected and disheartened from any Adverſity that befalls him.</hi>

Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> deſcribes it, a Quality<note n="*" place="bottom">Timendorum contemptrix, quae terribilia, &amp; ſub jugum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem noſtram mittentia deſpicit, provocat, frangit.</note>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But now, in regard that this Matter is not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and many falſe Pretenders to this Virtue are ſet up,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:53648:613"/>which are not really of the right Line. It may not be amiſs to expatiate a little more upon the true Nature of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and in ſo doing, to diſcover and reject the vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours concerning it. We will therefore obſerve four Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are all of them requiſite to the forming of this Virtue; and if what would paſs for ſuch, be deſective in any one of them, That we may be ſure, is counterfeit, and of a Baſtard Race.</p>
                           <p>As firſt of all, True Courage is univerſal, that is, it makes a brave ſtand againſt every kind of Difficulty and Danger without diſtinction, and this ſhews us the mighty miſtake of confining this notion of Courage to Military Valour only; That indeed gains Eſteem with the generality of People, becauſe it makes more Shew and Noiſe in the World, and yet oftentimes there is nothing of ſubſtance or ſolidity at the bottom of it. Now allowing Military Valour all that can poſſibly belong to it, yet at beſt, it is but one part, and that a ſmall one neither; a ſingle Ray of that Glory which the true and entire, the perfect, and univerſal Valour, ſheds round about it. For by this a Man is the ſame thing alone, that he is in Company; the ſame brave Man upon a Bed of Languiſhing and Pain, as in the Field, and heat of Action; and marches up againſt Death with all his Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations looking on, and lamenting his Fate, as he would at the Head of an Army, when animated by the Shouts of thoſe that aſſiſt in the Engagement. This Military and Fighting Courage, is more peculiar and natural to Brute Beaſts; and among them, we ſind accordingly, that the Female Sex have it in common with the Males. But in Men it is frequently the effect of Art, rather than any Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in Nature; kindled by the dread of Captivity and ill uſage; by the evident Neceſſity of doing bravely in their own Deſence; and the certain proſpect of Death or Wounds, Poverty, or Pain, or Puniſhment, if they do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. All which have not any influence upon Beaſts; nor do they lie under the leaſt apprehenſion of them. The Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Men is a ſort of wiſe Cowardice; and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, That <hi>every Man would be a Coward if he durſt.</hi> It is Fear attended with skill to ſhun one Evil by another; and Anger is the Liquor that tempers, the File that ſharpens it; But in Brutes it is genuine and pure, undeſigning and unconſtrained. Men arrive at ſome ſort of Maſtery and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it by Cuſtom and long Acquaintance, by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Education, and Example; upon which account it is,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:53648:614"/>that we find it ſometimes among the meaneſt, moſt ignorant, and moſt degenerate ſort of People. A Footman that hath run away from his Maſter, an Apprentice from behind a Counter, a Villain out of a common Gaol, ſhall very often make a good Souldier, ſtand a Charge, and do Duty very well; and yet have no ſuch thing as real Fortitude; there is not the leaſt tincture or ſpark of Virtue, or Philoſophical Bravery in all this Fire.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The ſecond neceſſary Ingredient in this noble Compoſition is a full and diſtinct Knowledge of the Difficulty, the Toil, the Danger, that aſſaults us in our Undertaking; and alſo of the Beauty, the Decency, the Juſtice, and the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of attempting vigorouſly, or conſtantly and patiently enduring, what we are called to at that time. And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Folly and Miſtake of confounding this Courage (as ſome do) with giddy unthinking Raſhneſs; or elſe with Fool-hardineſs, and a brutal inſenſibility.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non eſt inconſulta temeritas, nec periculorum amor, nec formidabilium appetitio; diligentiſſima in tutelâ ſui fortitudo eſt. Et eadem patientiſſima eorum quibus falſa ſpecies malorum eſt.</note> 
                              <hi>It is by no means</hi> (<hi>ſays</hi> Seneca) <hi>an inconſiderate forwardneſs; not a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Danger, nor a deſire of thoſe Accidents, which ſtrike a Terrour into common Men; Fortitude is provident and careful, and diligent in her own Defence; and yet ſhe is extreamly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and reſigned under thoſe things, which are (commonly but falſely) reputed Evils.</hi> There cannot poſſibly be any ſuch thing as Virtue, where there is no Knowledge, no Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and a Man cannot with any good Senſe be ſaid to deſpiſe that Danger, which he knows not, and does not rightly underſtand. For at this rate we cannot refuſe the honour of this Virtue to Brutes; who in every part which concerns the Action, or the Suffering, do equal, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Stouteſt Men; and yield to us in no point, but that of foreſeeing and making a true Eſtimate of our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For Valour diſtinguiſhes it ſelf particularly by going on with our Eyes open, and not running blindfold; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find by Experience, that thoſe who undertake boldly, without regarding, or duly weighing what is like to come on't; commonly flinch and ſneak, and prove errand Daſtards, when they are driven to a puſh.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A third Ingredient neceſſary to be taken notice of in the Character of Fortitude, is, That it is a Reſolution and
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:53648:614"/>firmneſs of Mind founded upon ſolid and good Principles; the ſenſe of Duty, the Honeſty, and Juſtice of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; and ſuch other Motives; and this too ſuch a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as never wavers or abates, whatever the Event be: But perſiſts with unmoveable Generoſity, till either the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign be brought to Perfection, or the Life loſt in the Attempt. The mention of this Qualification may at firſt ſight ſeem ſomewhat ſuperfluous in the former part of the Deſcription, but it is in reality ſeaſonable and of good uſe; and that, as upon its own account, ſo more eſpecially becauſe it gives us an occaſion to obviate two or three very groſs and common Miſtakes, with relation to this Matter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> As firſt, ſome have ſo odd, ſo ſtupid a notion of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as to place it in bodily Strength, the Structure of the Man, and the largeneſs of his Limbs. But alas! This is no Excellence belonging to the Body, not the ſtiffneſs of the Muſcles, the knitting of the Joynts, or the ſize of an Arm, or a Leg; but a quality peculiar to the Soul, and entirely reſiding there. The worth of a Man is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from his Heart, and his Will; there it is, that his true Honour is to be found; and the only Advantage, the true and compleat Victory to be gained over an Enemy, is the ſhaking his Conſtancy, driving away his Reſolution, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him to Terrour and Diſorder, and putting his Virtue to flight. All other Advantages are either fictitious, and imaginary, or elſe borrowed, and not properly ours; The luſtineſs and ſtrength of a Leg and an Arm, is an Excellence fit for a Porter only to boaſt of: To force our Enemy to give ground, or engage him in a diſadvantageous ground, is not a Commendation belonging to Us, but to Fortune. He that continues his Courage to the laſt, and ſlackens not one whit of his Gallantry, and Conſtancy, at the approach of Danger or Death; you may call him beaten, if you pleaſe, but then it is not his Adverſary but the Chance of War that beats him; and if he happen to fall in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is killed, I confeſs, but he is not Conquered. If Fate be to blame, he is not; for though he die unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he does not die cowardly and baſely: For the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanteſt Men cannot command Events anſwerable to their Merits, and very frequently are leſs ſucceſsful than others. Another Errour, yet more ſenſeleſs than the former, is the looking upon thoſe to be ſtout and brave, who ſwagger, and ſtrut, and talk big, and by a contemptuous Air, a ſtern Countenance, and vain boaſts, would fain get the Reputation
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:53648:615"/>of Valour. But theſe do not often meet with People ſilly enough to be frightned into ſuch an Opinion; and when the Bully comes to be tryed, a difference is ſoon ſeen, between a Hector and a Hero.</p>
                           <p>Nor are they leſs deceived, who give the Title of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to ſubtlety and ſtratagem, or to Induſtry and Art; This is too ſacrilegious a Prophanation, to bring in Courage acting ſo mean and ſneaking a part: Theſe are trick and diſguiſe, and would put falſe Stones upon the undiſcerning World for true Jewels. The <hi>Laccdaemonians,</hi> who bred their Youth to Wreſtling, would not ſuffer Maſters in any of their Cities, that ſo their Warlike Exerciſes, and growing expert in them, might be entirely Nature's Work, and that Art might uſurp no part of the Glory. We count it a bold and brave under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to encounter Bears, or Lyons, or wild Boars, who have nothing but their natural Fierceneſs to render them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; but the ſame Commendation is not reckoned due to one, that engages with Bees or Waſps, who watch their advantage, and go cunningly to work. <hi>Alexander</hi> would never play at the Olympick Games; for the Strife, he ſaid, was not well contrived, where a private Man of no Soul might come off with applauſe, and a King with a great one might be thrown out with Diſgrace. There is no manner of reaſon, why a Man of Honour ſhould value himſelf, or offer to put his Valour upon a Proof, which the errandeſt Coward in the World, if he be better taught, and dextrous at his Weapon, ſhall be able to baſſle him in. For ſuch a Conqueſt is in no degree owing to Courage, or true Virtue; but to activity of Body, and ſome particular motions, which are purely the effect of Artifice and Addreſs; ſuch as the baſeſt and moſt timorous may excel in, and ſuch as a truly valiant Perſon, may either not know how to perform, or may think it beneath him to deſcend to them. Fencing particularly is ſuch an advantage, The Braveſt may be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unskilful in it, and the moſt deſpicable Wretches may be Maſters of it. And how many Scoundrels do we ſee in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Street, ready to draw upon all occaſions; how many Cheats that play Prizes, and Hack one another for Money; who would not ſtand one Charge at the approach of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? The ſame may be ſaid of that aſſurance and preſence of Mind, which proceeds from habitual Exerciſe, and long Cuſtom. How many hazardous things do Tumblers, and Rope-dancers, and Seamen do, without the leaſt concern? Not that theſe Men are really more valiant than others, or
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:53648:615"/>dare venture farther into Danger; but becauſe this is their own way, what they have been bred up in, and accuſtomed to from Children; and Practice hath worn out thoſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, which a Gallanter Man would have, who is raw and unexperienced in the Trade.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> One very wrong Notion more it is ſit I ſhould mention upon this occaſion; That, I mean, which, for want of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving nicely the Springs by which Men are moved, and the true ſourſe of each Action, does very abſurdly put all that to the account of Bravery and Courage, which is in truth a Weakneſs, and owing merely to Heat of Paſſion, or a Zealous Concern for ſome particular Intereſt. For, as a Man cannot deſerve to have his Vertues commended in point of Juſtice, for being faithful and ſerviceable to thoſe he dearly loves; nor in point of Chaſtity, for not abuſing his own Daughter, or his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If therefore Avarice ſhall make a Man bold, as it does Spies and Traitors, Robbers and Villains, Merchants at Sea, or Souldiers of Fortune, that ſight purely for pay; if Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vain Glory, an itch to get the name of a brave Man, kindle the ſpark of Honour as they call it; which may very reaſonably be preſumed to be the caſe of a great many Men of the Sword, (who will not ſcruple to own ſometimes, that if they could be verily perſwaded they ſhould die in the Attack, nothing ſhould ever bring them on:) If they grow peeviſh and diſcontented, weary of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or worn out with pain, like <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Souldier, who, whilſt in violent Torment with a Fiſtula, ventured at all, but when the Diſeaſe was Cured, and he in perfect Health again, could never be got to face an Enemy more. In a word, if there be nothing but ſome particular humour, or ſelfiſh and foreign Conſideration at the bottom, how fair ſoever the Exploits, that are built upon this may look, yet ſtill the foundation hath a flaw, and conſequently, call the thing what elſe you will, but while it is defective in ſo very material a part, you muſt not be allowed to call it Valour or Virtue.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> I proceed now to the fourth Qualification of this noble Excellence, and that is Prudence and Diſcretion in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part. Which being once admitted, ſeveral other falſe
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:53648:616"/>opinions relating to this Matter, are from thenceforth out of doors, ſuch particularly as theſe that follow. That a Man, who is really couragious, ſhould not uſe any defence to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf from the Evils and Inconveniences which threaten him; that he thould never be in fear of a Surpriſe, nor be follicitous to make proviſion againſt it; that he ſhould not ſo much as feel the leaſt ſhock or impreſſions of diſorder from any thing more than ordinary, or that happens una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; as a Clap of Thunder, the Diſcharge of a Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhor, the tumbling down of a Breach. Now all this is monſtrouſly fooliſh and abſurd, for a Man of Fortitude is allowed to take all imaginable care of his own Preſervation; and to have as quick and ſenſible reſentments of all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents whatſoever, as any other Perſon. Nor is this the leaſt diſparagement or reflection upon his Vertues, provided he be not daunted and diſmayed, but keep up his mind in the ſame ſteadineſs of Temper, and do not depart from his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Reſolution. Nay, it is not only his Right and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, but his Duty and juſt Commendation, to wheel and decline, and defend himſelf from harms, ſo long as there are any honeſt ſhifts, and decent Remedies left; but when there are none, then he muſt ſtand his ground, receive the worſt that can come, and dare to ſuffer any thing rather than to do what is vicious, or unbecoming his Character, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or eſcape of it. He muſt then like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> obey the Commands from<note n="*" place="bottom">Mens immota manet, lachrymae voluntur inanes.</note> above at any rate, for ſo we find him deſcribed by the Poet.

                              <hi>Socrates</hi> therefore uſed to laugh at thoſe idle Men, who condemned all Flight, and giving of ground, as inconſiſtent with Fortitude. <hi>What?</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall a Man be reproached with Cowardice, for defeating his Enemy, becauſe this was done by retreating from before him?

The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who pretended to the moſt obſtinate Courage of any Nation in the World, yet in that renowned action of <hi>Platea</hi> gave ground, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to break the <hi>Perſian</hi> Troops, and diſorder them in the

This was an advantage which they had no other way of compaſſing, and the Succeſs anſwered the wiſdom of the Deſign; for they won the Day by this Feint of loſing it. In a word, the moſt warlike Countrys in the World have given it authority, and never thought themſelves diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Practice. Nay, even the <hi>Stoicks</hi> after all their impracticable, and romantick Stretches of humane nature, are content to allow their wiſe Man, ſo far as looking Pale, and ſhivering at new and ſurpriſing Accidents; provided this be only a bodily Affection, and that it do not enter ſo deep, or laſt ſo long, as to give the Soul any part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>

                              <p>NOW that we may cut our Work out, and lay it in due order; it is neceſſary, in the firſt place, that I put my Reader in remembrance, that this Virtue undertakes to deal with all that, (whatever it be) which is called Evil; according to the moſt popular and extenſive ſignification of the Word. Now this Evil is of two ſorts, either External, or Internal. The former is that which aſſaults us from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and goes by great variety of Names; ſuch as, Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Afflictions, Injuries, Misfortunes, Caſualties, or unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Accidents. The other ariſes from within, and hath its reſidence in the Soul; but it is excited, and agitated by the Evil from without: Such particularly are thoſe Paſſions, which diſturb and diſcontent us, as Fear, Grief, Anger, and the reſt of that black diſorderly Crew. It will be proper for us to ſpeak to each part of this Diviſion fully and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; to explain their Operations, to provide Men with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies, and ſufficient means for the ſubduing and ſoftening, and regulating theſe Grievances. And ſuch are the Arguments and Directions for the Virtue of Fortitude, now under our Conſideration. Conſequently then, what you are to expect upon this Subject will conſiſt of two parts, the one reſpecting the Calamities and Diſaſtrous Accidents of
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:53648:617"/>our Lives; the other concerning the Paſſions, which theſe Accidents provoke, and ſtimulate in our Minds. And here my Reader muſt recollect that the general Directions thought neceſſary for the bearing good or ill Fortune decently, he hath been ſupplyed with already.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> WE may conſider theſe External Evils, in three ſeveral reſpects. Firſt, with regard to the cauſes or occaſions of them, (which ſhall make the Subject of this Chapter) next in their Effects; and laſtly, with regard to what they are in themſelves; where I ſhall treat of the ſeveral Species of them diſtinctly. And under each of theſe Heads, I will make it my endeavour to lay down ſuch Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as may ſuſtain us under, and fortifie us againſt them.</p>
                              <p>The Cauſes or Occaſions of theſe afflicting Accidents, which are capable of happening to every one of us, may be publick or general, when they affect a great many at the ſame time; when whole Kingdoms, or Neighbourhoods at leaſt are involved at once; ſuch as Peſtilence, Famine, War, Tyranny, and Oppreſſion. And theſe, for the moſt part, are Rods of the divine Vengeance; Scourges ſent by him to chaſtiſe the exorbitant Wickedneſs of obſtinate Men, who reſuſe to be won over by gentler methods of Reformation: (At leaſt we know not what immediate cauſe to aſcribe them to,) or elſe they are private Calamities, and ſuch as we are able to trace up to their firſt Author and Original; that is, they are inflicted and brought upon us by ſome other Perſon: And thus both the private and publick Misfortunes are of two forts. Now the publick Calamities, thoſe, I mean, which proceed from a general Cauſe, though they do really come home to each ſingle Perſon; yet are they in different reſpects more or leſs grievous, important, and dangerous,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:53648:617"/>than the private ones, of which we are able to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and particular account. They are more ſo, becauſe they aſſault us with united force, fall on in Troops, and with greater violence, make a louder noiſe, rage more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, have a longer and blacker train of ill Conſequences attending them, are more perplexing and amazing, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate greater Diſorders, and a more general Confuſion. But then, they are leſs ſo too, in regard of their being thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and for the numbers, which are involved in them together: For when a Diſaſter is common, every Man is apt to think his own ſhare of it the leſs. It is ſome kind of comfort, to think that we are not ſingled out for Examples; and for this reaſon, the efficacy of ſuch Corrections is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the leſs; for every Man takes Sanctuary in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Calamity, and imputes it to ſome univerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in Nature, or to ſome unuſual concurrence of natural Cauſes; and ſo ſhelters himſelf in the Crowd by vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which perſonal afflictions leave no room for. And beſides, daily experience ſhews, that the Evils brought upon us by other Men, gall us more ſenſibly, and go nearer to the Quick, and have a greater influence upon our Minds, than any of the former ſort are wont to do. Now all theſe, both of the one, and the other ſort, have ſeveral proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Conſiderations to qualifie and render them very ſupportable to us, as particularly theſe that follow.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When we have any publick Calamities to encounter, it will become us very ſeriouſly to reflect whence they come, and by whom they are ſent. That the Cauſe and Author of them is God, an Omnipotent and All-wiſe Providence; whoſe Pleaſure we are ſubject to, and have an abſolute and entire dependence upon; that he governs and diſpoſes all things, and holds thoſe vain Men in deriſion who <hi>hope to burſt his Bands aſimder, and to caſt away his Cords from them;</hi> that we and all the whole Creation are tied by Laws of an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity; and that the ſtrongeſt Combinations, nay the univerſal joynt ſtrength of the whole World, is much too weak to reverſe or reſiſt his Will. Moſt certain it is, that Providence, and Neceſſity, or Deſtiny, when we ſpeak ſtrictly and properly, are but one and the ſame thing; There is no eſſential diſſerence between them, or the Laws upon which they proceed; and all they vary in, is only as to thoſe different reſpects, which we are uſed to conſider, and reaſon upon them in. Now to murmur and repine, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our ſelves, that Matters are not otherwiſe ordered with
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:53648:618"/>us, is firſt of all an Impiety peculiar to Mankind; for all other Creatures ſubmit quietly and contentedly, and Man only hath the inſolence to be angry, and find fault, and fly out into ſawcy Paſſions, and diſcontented Complaints againſt his Maker. But beſides the wickedneſs of the thing, it is extreamly fooliſh; for all this rage is to no manner of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor does it mend the matter one whit. Our Miſtreſs is abſolute, and her Power (as I ſaid) uncontroulable, and thoſe who draw back the ſhoulder, and will not follow her contentedly, ſhe will drag him along, whether he will or no.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ad hoe ſacramentum adacti ſumus; ferre mortalia, rec ijs perturbari, quae vitate noſtrae poteſtatis non eſt.

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The firſt thing to be done for the relief of private Evils, and ſuch as other People bring upon us, and which we are apt to be very ſenſibly affected with, is, nicely and truly to diſtinguiſh them, that we may not have looſe confuſed Ideas, and ſo be led into miſapprehenſions about them. Now of theſe ſome are Diſpleaſing, and others are Offenſive to us. We oftentimes conceive a Diſpleaſure at Perſons, who have been guilty of no Offence; neither intentionally, nor actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: As when they either ask us, or deny us ſomething up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very good reaſons, which was at that time unſeaſonable, or inconvenient for us or them: We are all apt to be out of humour upon ſuch occaſions, and yet there is no offence given, no injury done. For offences, we muſt know, are of two forts, ſome croſs our Deſigns, and perplex our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by offering ſomewhat contrary to Equity and good Conſcience, and this is injuring us: Others have nothing to do with our Concerns, but are directed to, and terminate in our Perſons, which are thereby contemptuouſly uſed, or otherwiſe ill treated, and this Treatment may be either in Words or Actions; theſe are more grating, and harder to be born, than any other fort of Affliction whatſoever.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The firſt and general Advice againſt all theſe ſorts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, is, To eſtabliſh our minds in a firm Reſolution, not to be carried away by common Opinions; to conſider things, not as the World eſteems of them, but as they really are;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:53648:619"/>weighing them and their Conſequences, in the juſt balance of Reaſon and Truth. For the generality of Mankind are ramely led by the noſe, wholly governed by Prejudice and Impreſſion. How many of thoſe, who call themſelves Men of Honour, think it a leſs affront to have a dangerous wound given them, than a Box on the Ear, and had rather die upon the Spot, than hear approbrious I anguage? In ſhort, Opinion meaſures and judges of every thing; and it is not ſo much the thing it ſelf, as the Opinion Men have of it, that provokes our Indignation; Our own Impatience does us more hurt, and creates us more uneaſineſs, than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have occaſioned it. So that we our ſelves are more injurious to our ſelves, than ever thoſe we complain of were to us.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As for the other Rules, and ſuch as are more particular to our Caſe, theſe may be deduced firſt of all from our ſelves, (and here indeed we ought firſt to look, and ux our Thoughts) For theſe offences may perhaps be owing to our own Defects, or Faults, or Infirmities. Perhaps what was ſaid or done is only a little Raillery, grounded upon ſome defect in our Perſon, which they had a mind to mimick or expoſe. And how fooliſh is it for us to be out of humour, at that which is none of our Fault? The beſt way to cut off occaſion from thoſe we converſe with, and prevent their taking any advantage of this kind, is to be before-hand with them, by mentioning it firſt our ſelves; that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we are ſenſible of the thing our ſelves, and that it is not in their power to mortifie us, by reproaching a defect which we did not know before: If any fault of ours gave the occaſion, and we have deſerved this affront, what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can here be for Paſſion and Reſentment: It is then no longer an Offence, but a Correction and juſt Reprimand; and we ought to receive it as a Chaſtiſement, and improve under it accordingly. But very frequently, and indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, our Peeviſhneſs and Diſcontent ariſes from ſome weakneſs of our own, which renders us jealous and humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Now the way to cure this, is to correct our own Captiouſneſs, and be leſs nice and tender in thoſe points of Honour; which are ſo uneaſie to our ſelves and to other People: To arm our ſelves with a maſculine greatneſs of Soul, and deſpiſe the little Follies and Indiſcretions of the Company we converſe with. It is a ſhrewd preſumption that a Man is not ſound, when he roars out every time you touch him: And we muſt never expect to be eaſie as long as we
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:53648:619"/>live, if we take exceptions at every trifling thing, every little freedom that paſſes in Converſation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Another ſort of Directions may be taken from the Perſons at whom we are offended: Let us form to our own minds a general Repreſentation of thoſe we live among, and ſee what their humour, their diſpoſition, and way is. The greater part of Mankind find their chief ſatisfaction in doing ill, and make a Computation of their Power, by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it gives them, to be inſolent and injurious to other People. Thoſe who delight in Innocence and Goodneſs are but very few in compariſon: This therefore we ought to reckon upon as a never failing Concluſion, that, which way ſoever we turn our ſelves, we ſhould be ſure to meet with ſome body or other diſpoſed to give us offence: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we meet with Men, it is odds, but we meet with Injuries and Affronts among them. This is ſo ſure, ſo ruled a Caſe, that even Law-givers themſelves, whoſe peculiar buſineſs it is to reform the World, in their meaſures for diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive and commutative Juſtice, have found a neceſſity of allowing and conniving at ſeveral irregularities, which were never to be prevented. Now this Neceſſity of giving and taking offence ariſes, firſt of all, from the Contrariety, and inconſiſtence of Humours and Inclinations; from hence we are able to account for many offences taken, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to be given. Then again from the Coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or oppoſition of Men's Intereſts and Affairs, which is the occaſion, that the ſame thing which contributes to the Pleaſure, or Proſit, or Happineſs of ſome, tends to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfacation, or Detriment, or Miſchief of others: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the Ideas we are able to form of the World in its preſent Circumſtances, thus it muſt be, and we cannot diſcern how it ſhould be otherwiſe. If the Perſon who gave you offence, be a fooliſh, or a raſh, unthinking Man, (and ſuch to be ſure he is, for a Wiſe and Good Man will be offenſive to no body, why do you complain of a thing done by one who hath not his Wits about him? You bear with a Mad-man, nay, you are ſo far from being angry, that you pity him; you laught at a Buffoon, or a Child; and I pray how is a Drunken Man or a Fool, a Colerick, or an Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Man, more worth your anger than any of thoſe? When ſuch Fellows therefore let looſe their Tongues upon you, the beſt way is to make no reply: Hold your tongue, and leave Matters there. It is a brave and noble, yea, and a Cruel Revenge too, which we take upon a Fool, in
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:53648:620"/>diſregarding and deſpiſing him; it robs him of all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he promiſed himſelf by provoking us to paſſion, and plainly declares, that we think him an impertinent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant wretch, better than all the ſharpeſt repartee would poſſibly expreſs it. If we reply, this debaſes us and is a ſort of entring into compariſon with him; it is the ſhewing him too much reſpect, and doing an injury to our ſelves.

You muſt have a due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of your ſelf, and of the Perſon who gives you the Offence: As to your ſelf, take care not to be guilty of a thing ſo miſ-becoming, ſo very much below you as the ſuffering your ſelf to be overcome, and put beſides your Reaſon. The imprudent Man who ſeems to ſuſpect himſelf, and flies out into rage upon every trifle, declares by this carriage, that he looks upon himſelf ſit to be affronted, for indeed it is meanneſs and littleneſs of Soul, or a Conſciouſneſs of our own inſufficiency, that hinders us from being above reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kind, and deſpiſing what we are ſenſible does not belong to us. A Wiſe and good Man is not capable of being injured, but is firm, ſecure, and inviolable; for the quality that renders any thing inviolable, is not the being above the power or force of Men, but above the being broken or made the worſe for it: And nothing would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie us more againſt every manner of accidents than the poſſeſſing our Souls with this Maxim, That we can never be hurt indeed, but by our own ſelves; if our Reaſon be what it ought, and our Actions according to it, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable. Hence it was, that <hi>Socrates</hi> hath taught us what comforts to apply in ſuch Extremities by his own Example. Anitus <hi>and</hi> Melitus <hi>may kill me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but they cannot hurt me.</hi> And thus a good Man as he is not capable of ill within, and will not offer any, ſo he is impenetrable from without, and cannot ſuffer any real Injury: Virtue is a Wall of Braſs, the Scoffs and Affronts are all repulſed or lodged there, and not one of them comes through to touch his Perſon;
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:53648:620"/>and to all this ſelf-ſecurity we may likewiſe add another Conſideration from the Opinion and Eſteem of the World; for there is no body but will look upon the Aggreſſor as a very ill Man, and upon the Patient as one not deſerving to be ſo treated: As to the Party who hath thus affronted you, if you eſteem him no better than an impertinent or idle fellow, uſe him accordingly, and ſhew that you value him not by a generous diſdain; if he be otherwiſe, you ſhould plead his excuſe to your ſelf; you ought to preſume that he had (or at leaſt apprehended that he had) occaſion for what he did; That it was not done out of any malicious deſign, but through inadvertency or miſtake, want of breeding, or ſome other very pardonable defect; if not ſo, then you may be confident he hath ſeen his error, is angry at himſelf for it, and wiſhes moſt heartily it had never been done: Once more let me add, that we ought to play the good husbands, and make the moſt of Injuries and Offences; for indeed they are no ſmall advantages which theſe put into our hands, particularly, they are capable of turning to very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count two ways, with regard to each of the parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. For firſt with regard to the perſon who did the Injury; this hath diſcovered the Man to us, we have ſeen a little more of the World; we know ſuch a one two well to truſt him another time; and have fair warning to avoid him ever after. But then Secondly, they help us to know our ſelves too, ſhew us our own infirmities, our breaches and blind ſides, where the Foe may get within us, and what we cannot hold out againſt; and this gives us warning to work upon thoſe breaches, and put them in a defenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt the next attack upon us. Let us learn to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that fault too, which occaſion'd the abuſe, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man may have the like provocation to reproach us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: This is the true way of defeating the malice of others, and doing right to our ſelves; for what nobler Revenge can a Man take upon his Enemies, than to turn their injuries and affronts to his own Prout, and to learn more Prudence and Conduct, and to grow the wiſer and better, more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and inoffenſive by being ill uſed. The World at this rate is an excellent School; and the more unreaſonable Men are, the more a Man of good fenſe and temper may improve himſelf under their even unjuſt Corrections.</p>

                                 <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of External Evils with regard to their Fruits and Effects.</head>
                              <p>HAving thus conſider'd the Cauſes, let us now enquire into the effects of our evils, and what fruits they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; where again we ſhall meet with very powerful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes and ſubſtantial remedies againſt them. Now theſe effects are many and great, general, and particular.</p>
                              <p>The general effects are ſuch as concern the good, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the order, and improvement of the Univerſe. The World would be quire ſtified and choak'd up, it would Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and putrifie, if it were not ſometimes ſtirred and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and put into a new form by ſuch important and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative accidents, as Plagues, and Famines, and War, and Mortality; theſe are the things that prune and purge it, and throw down that product which overburdens the ſoil; and by ſo doing they preſerve the reſt, and give them elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room: for were there no ſuch evacuations we ſhould not be able to move and live by one another. But then conſider the grateful Varieties and Viciſſitudes, the regular Succeſſions and alternate Changes, by which the World is thus adorned and beautified, every part of the world finds ſome convenience by theſe alterations. For from Nations and Men coming to be tranſplanted by ſuch means, the barbarous and wild and ſavage part of Mankind are poliſhed and civilized; Arts and Sciences, Learning and Policy are ſpread wider, and communicated to every part of the habitable Earth; ſo that we are to look upon the Univerſe as one large Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, where ſome Trees are removed to a more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Soil, others are graſted and inoculated, others cut down to the root, that they make more regular ſhoots by the loſs of ſuperfluous ſuckers, others quite plucked up, but all this done in ſuch order by the skillful Cultivater, that every thing tends to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap> profit and beauty of the ground. Theſe enlargements of our Thoughts, and conſiderations of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal advantage ought to content every Wife and good Man, and prevent irreverent reflections upon thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of God, which Men are too apt to accuſe for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and diſorderly; or to look upon with amazement as ſtrange and unaccountable. It is enough that they are the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:53648:621"/>ordinances of God and nature, and ought to ſatisfie us, that how odd ſoever they may appear with regard to that little ſpot of ground which is commanded by our own Eye, yet they do great and ſignal ſervice to the whole. For would we extend our proſpect, we ſhould quickly diſcern that what is loſt in one place is gained in another, or rather indeed to ſpeak more properly, that nothing is loſt any where, but all conduces to the juſt variety and convenience of the World in general.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vir ſapiens nihil indignetur ſibi accidere, ſciatque illa ipſa, quibus laedi videtur ad conſervationem univerſi pertinere, &amp; ex his eſſe quae curſum munch officiumque conſummant.</note> A <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> ſays one, <hi>will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs that happens to him; for he will obſerve, that thoſe very things by which his particular Intereſts ſeem to ſuffer, are expedient, and greatly contribute to the preſervation of the whole; and that theſe are the methods by which the courſe of the World is continued, and every part of it brought to its juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary perfection.</hi>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The particular and perſonal effects of theſe evils are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, according to the various tempers and conditions of the Men to whom they happen. To the good they are an exerciſe and trial to thoſe that are fallen, a relief and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, a warning and call to them that go aſtray; and to the obſtinately wicked, a diſpenſation of Puniſhment and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Of each of theſe uſes I ſhall ſay but one word or two very briefly.</p>
                              <p>And firſt, theſe external evils provide the good Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent opportunities of exerting and improving their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which would otherwiſe want matter to work upon, and lie idle and undiſcerned. A good Man under affliction, is in the ſame circumſtances with Fencers in their Schools, or Mariners in a Storm, or Soldiers in an Action, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in their Academy; that is, he is upon his proper duty, attending the buſineſs of his profeſſion, and ſhewing his skill in it; for theſe are the very methods that inſtruct, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſorm, and finiſh him in Virtue, that eſtabliſh him in Conſtancy and Courage, and enable him to conquer and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Fortune and the World: They bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with himſelf, make him know his own ſtrength by frequent experiments, tell him what he may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and promiſe himſelf from it; nor do they only give him a true repreſentation of his paſt and preſent condition, but
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:53648:622"/>they help to amend it too; they encourage and confirm his reſolutions of doing well, harden and accuſtom him to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, fix and determine his mind, ſecure his paſt conqueſts, and render him invincible for the time to come; Whereas on the contrary, a long calm of proſperity is exceeding apt to ſoften and enervate Men's minds, and to corrupt them by eaſe and leiſure, careleſsneſs and ſloth, inactivity and long diſuſe. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> for this reaſon uſed to ſay, that of all Men living he thought none ſo truly miſerable as thoſe who had never met with diſappointments, and croſſes, and trying afflictions, and compared their life to the dead ſea, where there is a perpetual Stagnation, and noxious vapours breed and reign for want of winds, and a vigorous commotion of the waters to break and diſperſe and drive them away.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To Delinquents and inconſiderate Offenders, theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are a check and curb to hold them in, and prevent the wild and furious ſallies of vice unreſtrained; or elſe a rebuke and chaſtiſement, the rod of an Affectionate but Provoked Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to reduce and reclaim them, that they may be more conſiderate and mindful of their duty hereafter, and abandon utterly thoſe courſes which have coſt them ſo much ſmart and pain. Thus it is with our minds as with our bodies; and the health of both is conſulted by the ſame applications. Theſe ſufferings are like the breathing of a Vein and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Phyſick, ſometimes made uſe of as preſervatives, to prevent the gathering of ill humours and divert them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; at other times as correctives and reſtoratives, to purge the corrupted maſs and carry off a diſeaſe already formed.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To the Obſtinate and Incorrigible they are a Puniſhment and Plague, a Sickle to cut thoſe down ſpeedily, whoſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are ripe for deſtruction, or elſe to make them more lingring and languiſhing ſpectacles of vengeance. And thus you may plainly diſcern very excellent and neceſſary effects of the troubles Men are uſed ſo bitterly to complain of, ſuch as may abundantly convince us how erroneous that opinion is, which looks upon ſuch diſpenſations as evils, and ought to prevad upon us to entertain them with Patience and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming temper of mind, to take them in good part as the inſtances and operations of the divine juſtice; and not only ſo, but to welcome them gladly as the uſeful inſtruments and ſure pledges of the tenderneſs and love, and careful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God; and eſpecially uſing our utmoſt diligence to benefit under them, and to anſwer the intention of that

Sickneſs and Pain, (for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodily indiſpoſitions, I join them together as one) Captivity, Baniſhment, Want, Diſgrace, Loſs of Friends, and Death.

                                 </note> that Pain is the greateſt, and in good truth the only evil attending this Mortal Body of ours; the moſt ſenſible, the moſt inſupportable, that which is leaſt to be cured, leaſt to be dealt with or aſſwaged by conſideration. But ſtill, though this be not altogether ſo capable of advice as moſt other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; yet ſome Remedies there are drawn from Reaſon, Juſtice, advantage and uſefulneſs, imitation and reſemblance of great perſons celebrated for their illuſtrious Virtue, and
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:53648:623"/>that branch of it which conſiſts of Patience, and theſe ſuch as they are I ſhall juſt propound to my Reader's Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Firſt then the enduring what is tedious and troubleſome is a neceſſary incumbrance of life, and charged in common upon all living creatures, upon Mankind moſt evidently and eſpecially. And it is by no means reaſonable that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould work a Miracle for our ſakes, and exempt us only. How abſurd is it therefore to fret and perplex our ſelves becauſe that hath hapned to one Man in particular, which might and may happen every moment to every Man without exception.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Nay it is not only general and common but natural too. We are born to it, and cannot in any equity and juſtice hope to be exempted; for indeed ſhould we ceaſe to be ſubject to it, we muſt ceaſe to be Men. Whatever is a fixt and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible Law of our Creation ought to be entertained with meekneſs and moderation: For we entred into life upon theſe terms, and the conditions of humanity expreſly indented for are old Age and Infirmities, Decays and Diſeaſes, Anguiſh and Pain. There is no poſſibility of avoiding theſe things; and what we can never get clear of, it will be our beſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſettle a reſolution of making the beſt of, and to learn how we may go through with it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

Si gravis brevis; ſi longus levis.</note>If the pain be long it is but moderate; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very ſupportable; and a Wiſe Man will be aſhamed to complain of any thing leſs than extremities. If it be violent and exceeding acute it is but ſhort, and we ſhould not repine or be driven to impatience for a ſuffering which is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over. And yet this muſt of neceſſity be the caſe; for nature cannot ſuſtain it ſelf under the continuance of extream Torture: There muſt be an end either of that or of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in a little time; and which of theſe two ſoever be the concluſion of it as to the ſuffering part, the matter comes all to one, and therefore let this give us courage and comfort.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Conſider again, that theſe ſufferings can go no deeper than the Body, we are not injured our very ſelves: every real injury takes off from the excellence and perfection of the thing; but now Sickneſs and Pain are ſo far from deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from and doing any real prejudice to us, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:53648:623"/>they furniſh matter, and put occaſions in our way for a more noble exerciſing of Virtue than any that we owe to Eaſe and perfect Health: And ſurely where there is more occaſion of praiſe and Virtue there cannot be leſs good. If the Body be what the Philoſophers uſually call the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind, why ſhould any one complain, for this inſtrument being applied to its proper uſe and worn out in the ſervice of its proper maſter? The Body was made on purpoſe to ſerve the Soul, but if every inconvenience which befalls the Body ſhall diſorder and afflict the mind, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature is quite inverted, and the Soul from thenceforth becomes a ſervant to the Body. Would you not think that man unreaſonably querulous and childiſh, who ſhould cry and roar and take on heavily becauſe ſome thorn in the hedge, as he paſſed by, or ſome unwary paſſenger had ſpoiled or torn his Clothes? A poor broker, who was to make Money of the Suit, might be allowed ſome concern upon ſuch an occaſion; but a Gentleman and one of ſubſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would make a jeſt of it, and not eſteem it worth a thought, when ſo trivial a loſs was compared with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance he had left. Now this Body of ours is no other than a garment, borrowed for a little while that our Soul may make its appearance, and act a ſhort part in it, upon the ſtage of this lower World: But the Soul in the mean while is that which commands our value and regard; and our great affair is to ſecure the honour and quiet of this better part, while ſojourning in this buſie and tumultuous life. And what do we think may be the true reaſon why Pain provokes us to ſo great impatience? What indeed, but that we place our happineſs upon wrong objects, and do not ſet up our reſt, nor ſeek our ſatisfactions in the Soul.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non aſſueverunt animo eſſe contenti; nimium illis cum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore fuit.</note> Men grow into coldneſs and negligence of this part, and grow too familiar and fond of the Body. And Pain, as if it were ſenſible of this folly of ours, plies us hard in our tendereſt part, eſpecially when a Man ſhivers and trembles at its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as if it took a pride to inſult over ſuch unreaſonable fear and concern.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The advantages however of this ſo much dreaded miſery are conſiderable; it helps to wean our affections, and teaches us to work off our reliſh and delight from that which we
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:53648:624"/>muſt ſhortly leave; for there is no one thing more aſſiſting to us in giving us a due ſenſe of the emptineſs of the World and what an errant cheat it is, than Sickneſs and Pain; and I think every Man muſt confeſs this to be a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of ſervice.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> It heightens the pleaſure conſequent upon it. For when a Diſeaſe hath had its courſe, the ſatisfaction of a recovery is much more ſenſible than any enjoyment of uninterrupted health. This chears and enlivens us, like Light out of the midſt of Darkneſs; and a Man would almoſt imagine that nature had contrived Pain on purpoſe, that by mingling ſome of thoſe ſharp intervals, eaſe and pleaſure might have due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done them, and be rendred more acceptable and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Let us then reflect upon theſe few Suggeſtions, and ſee what conſequences they naturally offer to us. If our Pain be moderate, the virtue of Patience cannot be very difficult; if it be extream, the glory of enduring it as becomes us is proportionably great; if it appear inſupportable, our own cowardice and effeminacy have made it ſo; if there are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, who can bear it decently, let us try to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for the ſmaller it is, the more diſtinguiſhing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable it is to be in among them. Let us not lay the blame at nature's door for making us no ſtronger: This is all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is not natural weakneſs but affected nicety and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that diſables us in this point. If we run away from Pain it will purſue us; if we ſurrender our ſelves to this enemy and ſuffer it to conquer us, we ſhall be treated with inſolence and barbarous uſage, and the reproach of tameneſs will ſtick hard upon us. If it tries to terrifie us and we ſtand our ground, the ſucceſs will be above our expectation; let us therefore defeat and diſappoint this deſign, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves more reſolute and brave than it thinks for. For the greateſt part of the ſmart and anguiſh is owing to our own ſoftneſs and delicacy, our yielding and ſinking under it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Non quia difficilia non audemus, ſed quia non audemus, difficilia.</note> 
                                 <hi>We do not flinch from things ſo much becauſe they are hard to be born, as we create that hardſhip to our ſelves by dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhrinking at them.</hi>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> I may reaſonably expect that all the former arguments ſhould be lookt upon as flights of ſpeculation, Philoſophical
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:53648:624"/>notions, which Men of refined thoughts entertain when they are at eaſe, but would ſoon find impracticable if brought to the tryal; and therefore to obviate this objection, I have reſerved to the laſt place the inſtances and examples of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe practice hath juſtified the poſſibility and mighty efficacy of all that hath been ſaid here, or is uſually urged in Books upon this occaſion. And theſe, not only of wiſe and extraordinary but of ignorant and common Men; Nay, even Women and Children are frequently mentioned in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have endured both long and acute pains and diſeaſes, and with a mind ſo ſteady and unbroken, that the anguiſh which hath taken away their lives was never able to ſubdue their conſtancy and courage. They have waited the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their torments, and encountered them knowingly, and met them gladly, and ſupported themſelves under them with marvellous chearfulneſs; nay, have even ſought and courted the ſevereſt and moſt exquiſite tortures humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of ſuffering. The <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Boys are notorious for whipping one another, till ſometimes they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired under the ſcourge, and all this without the leaſt change of Countenance. A ſort of barbarous diſcipline, inſtituted to harden them, that they might be better qualified to do their Countrey ſervice when thus inured to ſuſſering. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Page was burnt to the very Bone with a Coal, and endured it without the leaſt complaint, rather than he would interrupt the Sacrifice. A <hi>Spartan</hi> Boy let his Bowels be cat out by a Fox, rather than he would diſcover his Theft. <hi>Pompey,</hi> when taken by King <hi>Gentius,</hi> who would have compelled him to reveal the ſecrets of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate, thruſt his ſinger into the Fire, and burnt it till <hi>Gentius</hi> could bear the ſight no longer, to convince him, that all Torture would be loſt upon him.

                                 <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of Captivity or Impriſonment.</head>
                              <p>THis Affliction is very inconſiderable in compariſon of the former, and the conqueſt of it will prove exceeding eaſie to them, upon whom the preſcriptions againſt Sickneſs and Pain have found their deſired effect. For Men in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have the addition of this misfortune, confined to their houſes, their Beds, tied to a Rack and loaded with fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and this very conſinement is a part of their complaint, though the leaſt part. But however we will ſay one word or two of it.</p>
                              <p>Now what is it that Captivity or Confinement impriſons? The Body, that which is it ſelf the cover and the Priſon of
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:53648:625"/>the Soul; but the Mind continues at large and at its own diſpoſal, in deſpight of all the World: How can it indeed be ſenſible of any inconvenience from a Priſon, ſince even there it ranges abroad as freely, as gaily, takes as noble, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, as diſtant ſlights, if not much more ſo, than it does in other circumſtances? The Locks and Bars, and Walls of a Priſon are much too remote to have any power of faſtening it down or ſhutting it in; they muſt needs be ſo, ſince even the Body it ſelf which touches upon, is linked to, and hangs like a Clog faſtened to it, is not able to keep it down, or ſix it to any determinate place. And that Man will make a jeſt of all theſe artiſicial and wretched, theſe ſlight and childiſh encloſures, who hath learnt how to preſerve his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive liberty and to uſe the privilege and prerogative of his condition, which is, to be confined no where; no, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this World. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> derides the cruelty of the Perſecutors, and animates his Brethren by relling that a<note n="*" place="bottom">Chriſtianus, etiam extra carcerem, ſaeculo renunciavit, in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere etiam carceri; nihil intereſt ubi ſiris in ſaeculo, qui extra ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calam eſtis.

What mighty matter is it in what part of the World you are, whoſe principle it is not to be of the World? Let us change that name of ſo ill a ſound, and inſtead of a Priſon call it a retreat; where when you are ſhut up the ſleſh may be kept to a narrow room, but all doors are open to the Spirit, all places free to the Mind; this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the whole Man along with it, and leads him abroad whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it will.</hi>

If we are afflicted upon the account, our grievance is not owing to what we complain of, but to our own humour and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we will go to the Reaſon of the thing, all places are alike, and a Man's All is every where equally: For two words indeed comprehend the whole of what a Wiſe Man values, and thoſe two are Nature and Virtue.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſame Nature is common to all Countries, the ſame Sky, the ſame Elements. The ſame Sun ſhines, the ſame Stars riſe and ſet, and their Motion, their Extent, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion they appear in, the ſame. And ſure, if any part of Nature he to be valued, that above us is much more worthy of Conſideration and Eſteem, than this Sediment and groſs, and droſſy part, which we tread under our fect. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt proſpect of the Earth which we can take, does not amount to more than Ten or Twelve I eagues: So that a Soul, which ſettles its Affections upon this part, ſhuts it ſelf up in a very narrow compaſs. But the Face of this glorious Firmament, adorned and beautified with ſuch inſinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, which like ſo many grafts of Jewels gliſter over our heads, expands it ſelf; and that it may be more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and diſtinctly viewed, the Motion is perpetual and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and every part turned towards us; ſo that every point is viſible to every place, within the ſingle Revolution of each Day and Night. The Earth, which (taking the Seas, and ambient Atmoſphere into the account, is computed not to be above the hundred and ſixtieth part as big as the Sun,) is to Us incomparably leſs ſtill; for it is not viſible to us in any part, except that little ſpot, that ſingle Point upon which we ſtand. But, were it otherwiſe, what does this Change of our ſtanding ſignifie? We think it a hard caſe, to be born in one place, and driven to another. Have we any propriety, in the place of our Birth? Our Mothers might
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:53648:627"/>have been delivered in any other place, as well as that where they were; and nothing is more entirely Caſual, than the particular Spot where we firſt drew Breath, for there was in Nature the ſame poſſibility of our being born any where? Beſides, every Climate produces and carries Men, ſuſtains them with its Fruits, and furniſhes them with all the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Life; ſo that there is little fear of Periſhing any where. Every Country ſettles us among our Relations too; for all Mankind are ſo, nearly allied in Blood, and nearer yet in Charity and Affection. Friends too may be found any where, we need only be at the pains to make them, which will ſoon be done, if we are careful to win their Hearts by our Virtue and Wiſdom. Every quarter of the Habitable World is a Wiſe-man's Country, or rather indeed no part of it is his Country. It were an injury and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſuppoſe him a Stranger any where; and a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and littleneſs of Spirit in him to eſteem himſelf ſo. A Man ought to uſe his Privilege, and aſſert his natural Right, which conſiſts in living every where, as if he were at home, and dwelt in his own: In<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnes terras tanquam ſuas videre, &amp; ſuas tanquam omnium.</note> 
                                 <hi>looking upon all places, as if he had a propriety in them; and upon his own Eſtate or native Seil, as if it were in common to all Mankind.</hi>

Do not we ſtill carry the ſame Soul about with us? And will not our Virtue keep us company where ever we go? What can hinder a Man (ſaid <hi>Brutus</hi>) from carrying his Excellencies, all he is really and truly worth, into Baniſhment, or Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity? The Mind and its commendable Qualities are ſubject to no conſinement, circumſcribed within no determinate ſpace of ground; but can live, and act, and exert themſelves in all places indifferently. A good Man is a Citizen of the whole World, frank and free, content and cheerful where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Lot caſts him; always at home in his own Quarters; and always ſixt and ſettled, however this Caſe or Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantean that incloſes and conveys him, may be hurried and jumbbied from one place to another.<note n="†" place="bottom">Animus facer &amp; aternus ubique eſt, diis cognatus, omni mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do &amp; aevo par.</note>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THis is a very vulgar, and (like the reſt of theirs,) a very ſilly and poor ſpirited Complaint; for it ſuppoſes the whole, or at leaſt the moſt conſiderable part of a Man's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to depend upon the advantages of Fortune, and looks upon a low and mean Condition, as a real and ſore Evil. But now, to ſhew what that is in truth, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there are two ſorts of Poverty: One is, That Extremity of it, which we properly call Penury, or want of Bread; when thoſe ſupplies are lacking, which are neceſſary to the ſupport of humane Nature. And this is a Calamity, which happens but very ſeldom: For Providence hath been ſo bountiful, and Nature ſo prudent, that there are but a few of theſe abſolutely neceſſary things. The very Frame of our Bodies is a good defence in this caſe, and ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:53648:628"/>us to a needy Condition, that a little will ſerve the turn, and that little is to be had almoſt every where: Nay, it is to be had in ſuch quantities, as will not only reach to the keeping Life and Soul together, but are a ſufficient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency for moderate and frugal Perſons. If we do not affect to lay it on thick, and ſquander away our Proviſions; if we would take our meaſures from Reaſon and Nature, and be ſatisfied with what theſe deſire, and preſcribe to us; we ſhall ſeldom or never want enough for our purpoſe. But if we will create to our ſelves fantaſtical and imaginary wants, nothing can ever ſatisfie us.<note n="*" place="bottom">Si ad naturam vives, nunquam eris pauper; ſi ad opinionem, nunquam dives. Exiguum natura deſiderat; opinio immenſum.</note> 
                                 <hi>He that lives by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca, can never be Poor; and he that lives by Fancy, can never be Rich; for the former will gladly take up with a little, but the latter graſps at all, and there is no end of it.</hi> A Man that is maſter of any ſort of Trade, or bred up to any Profeſſion; nay, he that hath neither of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, if he have but the uſe of his Hands, is ſafe from theſe Extremities, and will find no juſt reaſon to fear, or to complain of this firſt ſort of Poverty.</p>
                              <p>The other ſort conſiſts in the want of thoſe things, which exceed a ſufficient proviſion for the uſes of Nature, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to Pomp and Pleaſure, Delicacy and Superſluity; what we commonly call a Decency, and this is in truth the thing moſt Men are ſo mightily concerned for; loſs of rich and ſumptuous Furniture, the not having a Down Bed, and a Table well ſpread, or a ſtately Houſe; ſhut out from the Comforts and the Ornaments of Life. But this, when all is done, is not Want, but Niceneſs; and that is the very Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe we labour under. Now all complaints of this Nature are highly unjuſt, for what they dread as Poverty, is rather to be preferred and wiſhed for: We ſee the Wiſeſt Man that ever lived, was for neither Poverty nor Riches, but only ſuch Food as was a convenient Subſiſtence for him. It is more agreeable to nature, more truly rich, more quiet and ſafe, than all that abundance Mankind are ſo fond of. Firſt, it is more congruous and agreeable to our Condition, becauſe Man came Naked into the World, and he muſt go ſo out; and how can he call any thing his own, which he neither brought along with him, nor can carry away with him? The Poſſeſſions we pretend to here, are like the Furniture in an
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:53648:628"/>Inn; ours to uſe while we ſtay, but not to remove when we leave the Houſe: And therefore all we ought to look at is our preſent Accommodation. Secondly, it is more true Riches, for a larger Mannor none can be poſſeſt of. He that hath enough, hath all the World.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6</note> 
                                 <hi>Godlineſs with Contentment is great Gain,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, it is ſafer and more quiet: For here is no Fear to perplex, no hope of Booty to tempt, no danger of Enemies to fence againſt; Poverty is ſecure in the inidſt of <hi>Banditi.</hi> A little Man, when covered all over with his Buckler, is leſs liable to danger, than a bigger and ſtronger, who is in many parts expoſed, and cannot bring his whole Body within the compaſs of his Shield; ſuch a condition, as it does not burden and fatigue a Man with great Troubles, ſo neither does it make him capable of great Loſſes. And therefore theſe ſort of People are always more eaſie, and free, and cheerful, for they have not ſo much to take care of, nor can they ſuffer ſo much by any ſtorm that ſhall happen to blow. Such a Poverty as this is ſnugg and cloſe, gay, and jolly, and ſecure; all foul Weather flies over its head; it makes us truly our own Men, maſters of our Lives, without the hurry and noiſe, the ſquabbles and contentions, which are the neceſſary incumbrances of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fortunes, and devour the greateſt part of their Eaſe and Time, who ſtand poſſeſt of them. And what precious things are theſe to be called, the Goods of this World, that are big with ſo many Miſchiefs, ſuch ſubſtantial and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Evils, that expoſe us to Injuries, enſlave us to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Suſpicions; to anxious Fears, and inordinate Deſires; and have ſo many thouſand artifices to trouble and diſquiet us? He that is diſcontented with the loſs of theſe things, is miſerable indeed; becauſe he is deprived of his Poſſeſſions, and underſtanding both; and ſo does more than double his loſs. The Life of Men in moderate Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is a condition much like that of Coaſters; but that of the rich is like Sailors out at Sea. Theſe are toſt and driven, and cannot make Land though they would never ſo fain; they muſt wait a favourable Gale, and the Current of the Tide to carry them in: The former are always near home, and have it in their power to Debark whenever they pleaſe.</p>
                              <p>To all theſe Conſiderations we ſhall do well to add one more; That of Great, and Generous, and juſtly Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſons, who have deſpiſed ſuch Loſſes, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="652" facs="tcp:53648:629"/>Almighty God for them, as ſo many ſignal Bleſſings. Such as <hi>Zeno</hi> after his Wrack, the <hi>Fabricij, Serrani,</hi> and the <hi>Curij</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> And this is an extraordinary Attainment in Virtue, when a Man can find his account, and diſcern, and ſatisfie himſelf with the wiſdom and kindneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in inſtances which the generality of the World look upon with the greateſt Horrour and Averſion. The Gods were heretofore painted Naked, to intimate, that they are above both the Neceſſities and Gayeties of this World; and how Godlike a Quality the Philoſophers heretofore eſteemed the deſpiſing of them, we may learn by that voluntary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, which ſo many of them embraced; at leaſt, if it was the work of Fate, and not their own Choice, by that eaſie Content and Acquieſcence of Spirit, with which they entertained it. To ſumm up all then in one word, to Perſons of Prudence and unprejudiced Affections, Men of elevated Souls, refined and purged from the droſs of Senſuality and Avarice, this condition of Life will appear preferrable; but to all People, who think at all, it is very tolerable.</p>

                              <p>If by Diſgrace, be meant, the loſs of Honour, or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or offices of Importance and Truſt, the Man is rather a Gainer than otherwiſe, and hath made a very advantageous Exchange. For what are ſuch promotions but ſplendid ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by which a Man hires himſelf out to the Publick, and lays out his Property, and the enjoyment of his Perſon in the Service of other People? Theſe Honours ſhine indeed and gliſter, but with that dazling light they kindle Envy and Jealouſie, burn up the Owner, and at laſt go out in Exile and Poverty. Let a Man but refreſh his memory with the Hiſtories of all Antiquity, and the moſt memorable paſſages of Great Men; ſee how thick a cloud they ſet in, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, almoſt to a Man, thoſe that were moſt renowned for Gallantry and Virtue, did not finiſh their courſe, in Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a Priſon; by Poyſon, or ſome other violent Death.

                              <p>If this word be interpreted of common Fame and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, every Wiſe Man ſhould have Spirit enough to deſpiſe That, and never trouble himſelf at all about it. He does but diſparage and degrade himſelf, and betray his want of improvement in the ſtudy of Wiſdom, who is got no higher in this noble Science, than to be concerned at thoſe falſe, raſh Judgments, and ſcandalous Reports, which are made and ſcattered at random; and which neither make a Man the better for their Commendations, nor one whit the worſe for their Cenſure and Reproaches.</p>

                                 <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Loſs of Friends.</head>
                              <p>BY Friends, I underſtand Children, Relations, and all whom Nature or Acquaintance have rendred near and dear to us.</p>
                              <p>And here, firſt of all, we ſhall do well to examine pretty ſtrictly into the true ſoundation of this Concern; whether the Complaints we utter, the Tears we ſhed, and all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and tender Reſentments we pretend, be grounded upon their Intereſt, or our own. I make no queſtion, but every Man will anſwer, that he grieves for their ſakes; but then moſt People muſt give us leave to doubt the Truth of this; and not take it ill, if we be Infidels in the caſe, till ſatisfied by ſome more ſubſtantial Argument, than the meer authority of having their bare word for it. It is but an officious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation of tenderneſs and natural Affection, to put on an inconſolable Melancholy, and be eternally lamenting the Misfortunes of our Friends, or the Dangers and Calamities of the Publick; for would we but draw aſide the Curtain, and probe our Souls to the quick, Self would be found at the bottom, and the true cauſe of our Griefs will appear to be that private Intereſt of our own, which is involved, and
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:53648:630"/>interwoven with theirs, this is the very thing that affects us ſo ſenſibly. And what is this but a ſpice of Envy, rather than true and generous Affection? For that very Death, or abſence of our Friends, which we bewail under the ſpecious Title of their Loſs and Misfortune, is in reality their mighty Gain, and greateſt Advantage.<note n="*" place="bottom">Moerere hoc eventum, invidi magis quam amici eſt.</note> The true uſe and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Death is the putting a final and abſolute Period to Men's Miſeries, the placing them in a condition incapable of ſuffering. Had God in his Wiſdom intended us a happier and more eaſie Being upon Earth, no doubt he would have contrived, that it ſhould have laſted longer. But, as Matters now ſtand, and conſidering the Evils our Lives are beſet with, it is a mercy he hath made them ſo ſhort.</p>
                              <p>If then we would ſpeak out, and confeſs the truth impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, this Affliction looks at home, and we lament the loſs, becauſe our own Affairs ſuffer in it. Now this at the firſt bluſh is evidently diſhonourable and ſelfiſh; and we ſhall have much ado to juſtifie our being ſorry, that thoſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſo dearly to love are in eaſe and happineſs. If we loved them, as our Saviour ſays, in the like caſe, we ſhould much rather rejoyce; and if they loved us, it is but a decent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to be content with ſome inconveniences, when the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of theſe is ſoftned by the conſideration of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Advantage. For<note n="†" place="bottom">Suis incommodis angi, non amicum, ſed ſeipſum amantis eſt.</note> 
                                 <hi>to be troubled at our own Loſs may argue that we love our ſelves, but it can never prove, that we love our Friends.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But, after all, there is an excellent and never failing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in ſtore for our Affliction, which all the malice and power of Fate can never wreſt out of our hands. And that is, a Reflection, that theſe Loſſes are not irreparable: For ſo long as we ſurvive our Friends, ſo long we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of making new ones. Friendſhip is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings humane Life can boaſt of; and there is this mighty advantage in it, which other happineſſes cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, that it is one of the eaſieſt to be attained. God makes Men, but Men make Friends: And they that do not want Virtue, need never want Friends; for this is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of acquiring them; and that which will always be ſerviceable in ſupplying the number of thoſe that are taken from us. If then Fortune hath robbed us of this Treaſure,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:53648:630"/>let us take care to reimburſe our ſelves; and by this means we ſhall be ſo far from living deſtitute, that the parting with thoſe we had, will only give us an opportunity of enlarging our Affections wider, and adding to the number.</p>

And if theſe Calamities do not immediately affect us, but others ſuffer in them, then the Paſſion we are moved to, is Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. When to the Conſideration of their own Nature, we join that additional one of their Cauſes or Occaſions, and reflect upon them as done or procured by ſome other Perſon, than the Paſſions provoked by them are. Anger, Hatred, Indignation, Spight, Envy, Jealouſie, Revenge; and all thoſe other Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which diſpoſe us to bear a grudge, and look with an evil Eye upon the Perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="656" facs="tcp:53648:631"/>our Souls free and undiſturbed by any of the Paſſions apt to be excited, and ſo grow outrageous upon theſe occaſions. But in regard they owe their very Being to theſe Afflictions, if a Man can manage the Rules and Remedies here already preſcribed, ſo as to gain an abſolute Conqueſt over the Evils themſelves: Theſe Paſſions will be cruſhed in the Egg, and all farther dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning them are wholly ſuperſeded. And this indeed is the beſt and moſt effectual way, to ſtifle and cut off the firſt Tendencies towards them. Efficacy and Succeſs muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wait upon this method, as that Fire is ſure to be quenched, from which all combuſtible Matter that might feed it, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn in time. But though this taking off the Fuel be the beſt, yet is it not the only way of keeping down this ſlame; and therefore I will provide for the other Courſe, by adding ſome Directions againſt each of theſe Paſſions in particular; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign will take up the leſs of our Time and Pains, in regard each of them hath formerly been drawn at length, and that in Colours ſo natural, ſo black and hideous, that it may reaſonably be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thoſe Repreſentations ſhould work us up to a due horrour and deteſtation of them.</p>

                              <p>LET us not be too haſty, and anticipate our Misfortunes, but be content to ſtay till they overtake us. Why ſhould we run forward to meet thoſe Miſeries, which at the ſame time we would fain run away from? Poſſibly they may not carry ſo far, but be ſpent, or fall to the ground before they reach us. Our Fears are every jot as fallible as our hopes: Perhaps the time which we expect with terrour, to bring our Affliction, may come big with Joy, or at leaſt bring a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort equivalent to the Sorrow. How many millions of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Accidents may interpoſe, and ward off that Thurſt, which we apprehend muſt give us our mortal Wound? Lightning, they tell you, will be diverted from its courſe by the motion of a Hat, and the fortunes of great States, and whole Nations are blaſted, and blown down in an inſtant by accidents, as ſlight as the Breath of ones Mouth. Give the Wheel but one whirl, and that which was at the top is tumbled down to the bottom; and it very frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:53648:631"/>that the Perſons who were our Terrour, become our Pity or our Scorn; and the Thing, from whence we looked for nothing but Ruin, is the beſt inſtrument and inſurance of our Safety. Nothing is ſo liable to Miſtakes as humane Proſpects: What the Prudence of Man hopes for, diſappoints him; what this fears, vaniſhes, and ſlips from under him, and what it never dreamt of happens to him. Almighty God keeps his Counſels to himſelf; he alone knows what he hath to do: But his Meaſures and Methods are dark and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from humane Sight; and this is the occaſion of the many amazing Changes we ſee in the World; that what we Project and Form to our ſelves in one way, God decrees and brings about in another. Let us not make our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy before our time; and it is very likely we may never be ſo at all: The future, which cheats ſo great a part of Mankind, may probably cheat us among the reſt, to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. It is a famous Maxim in the practice of Phyſick, that the acuteſt Diſtempers have no Prognoſticks to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon: And thus far it holds in our Fortune too, that the more furious and threatning her Symptoms are, the leſs we can form any certain Judgments from them. While there is life, there are hopes, is as good a Rule, as juſt a Comfort, with regard to our Affairs in Diſorder, as it is with reſpect to our Bodies in Sickneſs.</p>
                              <p>This Fear is not always the effect of Temper and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, but very often of Delicacy, and a too tender Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For we apprehend many things to be more grievous than really they are, meerly for want of being hardened in our Youth, and accuſtomed betimes to difficult and laborious Undertakings. And upon this account, we ſhould find great benefit in uſing our ſelves a great while before hand, to that which is apt to ſtrike a Terrour into us; repreſenting to our Imaginations the dreadfulleſt Dangers, that we can poſſibly fall into, and growing familiar with them by degrees; making ſome hazardous attemps by way of Gallantry and Tryal, that ſo we may bring our Courage to the touch, be before-hand with miſchance, and wreſt the weapons of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune out of her hands. For we ſhall find it much eaſier to reſiſt her, when we are the Aggreſſors, than when ſhe puts upon the Defenſive. At ſuch times, we have the Law in our own hands; can take leiſure to arm as we pleaſe, can make the moſt of every Advantage, and ſecure our Retreat; whereas, when ſhe comes on, and Attacks us, ſhe ſurpriſes, and ſingles us out at pleaſure. We ſhall do very well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:53648:632"/>to exerciſe our skill upon her, and, by beginning the Combat unprovoked, practice, and grow perfect in the Art of defending our Poſt: To ſound ſometimes a falſe Alarm, to ſee how we ſhould receive it, if it had been in earneſt, and a real Engagement. To ſet before our Eyes inſtances of aſtoniſhing Dangers, which the greateſt and worthieſt Men have been driven to; and recollect, that ſome have eſcaped the diſmalleſt that we can imagine, thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Confuſion and Deſpair; and that others have periſhed under the ſlighteſt and moſt inconſiderable, thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us out of our fooliſh ſecurity, and convince us, that we are no where ſo ſafe, that Conſideration and Prudence ſhould be laid aſide as unneceſſary.</p>

                              <p>GRief hath been formerly delineated, under the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the moſt tormenting, moſt prejudicial, and moſt unjuſt paſſion of all others. The greater reaſon to be ſure we have to acquaint our ſelves with proper Remedies againſt it. And theſe are of two kinds, Direct or Oblique.</p>
                              <p>I call thoſe Direct, which we derive from Philoſophy, and the force of Reaſon; ſuch as are employed in facing the Calamity, and learning to diſdain and contemn it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading our ſelves, that theſe External miſadventures are no real Evils, or if there be any thing in them, which may juſtifie ſo harſh a name; yet that they are ſo ſmall and ſlight, as not to be worth the diſordering our Minds about them; that any notable change in our Temper and Mind is more than the greateſt and moſt grievous of them all ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from us; and that to ſpend our Breath in Complaints, and our Days in Melancholy upon their account, is highly unjuſt and miſ-becoming. (For at this rate the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts</hi> have delivered themſelves upon theſe occaſions.) This method of keeping our ſelves above Grief, and every painful Paſſion, is indeed very beautiful and excellent; what challenges, not only our Commendation but our Wonder, becauſe it is exceeding Rare, and none but Souls of the firſt rate ſeem to be qualified for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
                              <pb n="659" facs="tcp:53648:632"/>
                              <p> There is another of a meaner and more practicable Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the effect of Philoſophy too, but not in its <hi>Aeme</hi> and utmoſt Perfection; for this is a more popular Method, and condeſcends to the Infirmities of Mankind; not ſo nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, but of more general uſe. And this is what I call Oblique, becauſe it conſiſts in quieting the uneaſie thought, by drawing off the Mind from its preſent Anguiſh to ſome more pleaſant and agreeable, or at leaſt to ſome freſh Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This is properly ſhifting the Scene, declining, or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the modern way of expreſſion, ſhamming the Misfortune. A remedy exceeding common, and ſuch as Mankind are fain to take refuge in upon ſeveral other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well as this. For, if we obſerve the thing nicely, it will appear, that many Cures are wrought both upon our Bodies and Minds this way. Thus when we are aſſaulted by Temptations, Divines adviſe, that we would not truſt our ſelves alone, but flee into Company. Thus when there is any ſtrong Defluxion of Humours upon the Vitals, which cannot be carried clear off, Phyſicians divert the Morbifick Matter, and throw it into ſome of thoſe parts, where the Lance, or the Searing-Iron may be able to deal with it. Thus Men that travel over dangerous and frightful Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, ſhut their Eyes cloſe, or look another way. Thus the Men of Courage in Fight, do not reflect upon their Danger, or think they are grappling with Death; but find themſelves tranſported and buſied with the Heat of Action. And of the many renowned Heroes, who have ſuffered calmly and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, nay, even of thoſe who have died by their own choice, or their own hands, (which ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were vain enough to do meerly for the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of deſpiſing it; and others have been ſo brave and conſtant to undergo, in the confidence and aſſured hope of a better Life, as the Chriſtian Martyrs; the Scholars of <hi>Hegeſias,</hi> and others after the reading of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Antiochus;</hi> or for the getting quit of the Miſeries of the preſent Life; or whatever other Motives they had;) ſtill this was but a Stratagem of Diverſion; for theſe Motives took their thoughts off from the main point in Difficulty. For that which they aſpired after, or that which they fled from, made the more vigorous impreſſion; and either quite ſwallowed up, or mightily aſſwaged the Terrour of what they were about to ſuffer. But few or none of theſe had that firmneſs of Soul to conſider the Calamities themſelves; to converſe with, and come cloſe up to them; to ſee them in their frightfulleſt
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:53648:633"/>forms, and yet not ſtart at them. This was a glory reſerved for <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Flavins</hi> condemned by <hi>Nero</hi> to die by the hand of <hi>Niger,</hi> and ſome very few beſides. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore content our ſelves very well with diverting our Minds by ſome other Conſiderations, when any croſs Accidents, or other external Calamities aſſault us. The common People ſeem to be ſenſible of ſome more than ordinary Efficacy in this Preſcription, when, upon all Melancholy occaſions, they adviſe their Friends not to think of that which gives them the Diſorder. And thoſe, who undertake to adviſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Perſons in Affliction, will do well to conſider what Counſel they are capable of following; to infuſe ſome other thoughts into them, by gentle and inſenſible degrees, ſo looſening and undermining the Object of their trouble, and trying to plant another in its room. For this taking the ground of their Melancholy from under them, before they are well aware of it, will prove a more real Conſolation (in the firſt and furious Paroxyſms eſpecially) than the moſt Philoſophical, or which is yet better, the moſt Chriſtian Harangue in the World. For though every Man may know, and urge pathetically enough, ſuch Arguments as Reaſon tells us, it is fit Melancholy Perſons ſhould ſubmit to; yet theſe may all be loſt, if the Application be out of time: And therefore it is very neceſſary, that Men ſhould proceed with Judgment, and Tenderneſs; that they ſhould obſerve, both in what manner the Paſſions are to be treated, and when they are fit to be treated with, when they will bear coming up to the point; and when they muſt be pacified by ſome powerful Diverſion.</p>

                              <p>MY Reader may poſſibly be ſtartled at this Title, ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it favours too much of Inhumanity; but to abate his Surpriſe, I muſt remind him, that there are two ſorts of Pity. The one firm, and brave, virtuous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, ſuch as we are told Almighty God and the bleſſed Spirits partake of; and this conſiſts in applying our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and actual Endeavours to relieve the Afflicted, yet ſo as not to take the Affliction upon our ſelves, nor do any
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:53648:633"/>thing in diminution of the juſtice of the Cauſe, or the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Character. The other is a womaniſh and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pity; full of Tenderneſs and Concern; which proceeds from weakneſs and effeminacy of Soul, concerning which I have ſpoken ſufficiently heretofore,<note place="margin">Book <hi>I.</hi> Chap. <hi>32.</hi>
                                 </note> in that part which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the ſeveral Paſſions. Now for the conquering and compoſing this ſecond ſort; Wiſdom directs us to ſuccour the Afflicted, and to eaſe his Burden, but not to put under our own Shoulder ſo far, as to bear the Load with him. In this Senſe it is, that God is ſaid to be Pitiful; and his Bowels and Yearnings muſt not be interpreted of the ſame uneaſineſſes we feel upon theſe occaſions, but of the ſame readineſs to do good, and to extend his help, which we find in our ſelves upon feeling thoſe uneaſineſſes. As the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian does all he can for his Patient, and the Counſellor for his Client; but then it ends in diligence and induſtry, and making the moſt of their Caſe; but never goes ſo far, as laying their miſcarriage to heart. The Wiſe Man is deſirous to aſſwage the Pain, but not content to ſmart with it; nor to darken and diſorder his Mind with the Vapours of that Melancholy, which he labours to quiet and compoſe. God Commands us to have a regard to the Poor, and to qualifie their Afflictions as well as we can; to plead their Cauſe for them, and to defend their Right; but yet at the ſame time he charges us to watch over our Paſſions, and take care that we be not balanced even by good Nature and Pity it ſelf, againſt Equity and Juſtice, and the Reſults of true Reaſon.</p>

                                 <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Remedies againſt Anger.</head>
                              <p>THeſe Remedies are many and various, ſuch as the Mind ought to lay in, and be ſtrongly armed and guarded with long before; Like People that expect a Siege; for it will be too late to begin to fortifie, when the Enemy hath opened his Trenches, and plays his Batteries upon us. They may be reduced to three Heads; The firſt are ſuch as ſecure all the Paſſes, and cut off the approaches and firſt beginnings of this Paſſion. For it is infinitely eaſier to repel, and guard the Avenues againſt it, than either to ſubdue and bring it to
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:53648:634"/>Rule, or to beat it out again, when once it hath got within us. We ſhall do well therefore to conſult our ſafety betimes, by delivering our ſelves from all thoſe cauſes and occaſions of Anger, which were heretofore obſerved and explained, when we were deſcribing the nature and riſe of this Paſſion. Such in particular as theſe that follow, 1. Weakneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 2. Indulgence and Effeminacy; a Sickneſs of the Soul, which muſt be cured by hardening it againſt any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which can poſſibly happen. 3. Niceneſs, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome Fancies, fondneſs for little Trifles, which muſt be corrected by bringing our Appetites, to plain and eaſie and ſimple things; for this indifferency and ſimplicity of Manners is the Mother of inward Peace and Content. And therefore<note n="*" place="bottom">Ad omnia compoſiti ſimus, quae bona &amp; paratiora, ſint no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                                 <hi>let us be prepared and capable of every thing, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what comes next, and eſteeming thoſe conveniences beſt and moſt acceptable, which are neareſt at hand, and will coſt us leaſt trouble.</hi> This is the general Rule given by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; and would be of great uſe, for the croſſing theſe particular humours, gives birth to furious Paſſions and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Inconveniences. <hi>Cotys,</hi> upon receiving a very Noble Preſent of Beautiful, but brittle Ware, broke all the Veſſels immediately, to prevent his being angry, whenever they ſhould happen to be broken by any other hand. This is what I cannot much extol, by reaſon it plainly ſhewed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of his own Vertue and Reſolution, and condemned him of Cowardice and Fear. He had therefore done a great deal better, in ſparing that extravagant way of Prevention, and ſettling in his Mind a firm Reſolve not to be moved at ſuch an Accident, whenſoever it ſhould happen. 4. Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which makes us eager and inquiſitive into things which we had much better live in contented Ignorance of. Thus <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when upon his Victory, he took the Letters, and Memorials, and ſeveral other Papers of Conſequence, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his Enemies, burnt them without ever examining what they contained. 5. Credulity, and eaſineſs to receive every new Impreſſion. 6. And above all the reſt, a cavilling and captious Humour, jealouſie of other People's Behaviour, and fancying they deſign Injuries and Affronts to us. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very much beneath a Man of Spirit and Generoſity, for how much ſoever it may ſeem to ſavour of Pride, and
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:53648:634"/>ſo indeed it does, yet this is a falſe Pride; and the Opinion of ones ſelf at the ſame time, that it is more than it ought to be, is yet degenerate, and of a Baſtard breed, mingled with meanneſs, and a little Soul; and therefore, wanting Solidity, for this ſelf-conceit, and being conſcious of ſome notable Defect, it expoſes the Perſon yet more by this pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and ſuſpicious temper. For he that looks upon himſelf under the Contempt of another, is in ſome ſenſe leſs than he; at leaſt he debaſes himſelf, and becomes ſo either in Reality, or in Opinion, by theſe diſtruſts, and niceneſſes in point of Reſpect.<note n="*" place="bottom">Nemo non eo, à quo ſe contemptum judicat, minor eſt.</note> If therefore we would expreſs a juſt and generous Senſe of our own Worth, we ſhould put any other interpretation rather than this, upon the doubtful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Converſation. Imagine them to proceed from Folly, or Indiſcretion, an unthinking Gayety, ſome defect in the Perſon, or what he did not obſerve, or could not help; if it come from our Friends, let us call it too great freedom, and the priviledge they take upon intimacy with us. If from thoſe under our own Government, we ſhould not ſuppoſe they knew they did amiſs; or ever were ſo ſtupid and fool-hardy, to provoke a Perſon, who they know hath power to chaſtiſe and make them ſmart ſeverely for their Inſolence. If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from mean and inſignificant Fellows, we can neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Dignity, nor ſuffer any Indignity from ſuch hands. Our Honour is not at their diſpoſal, and therefore we ſhould not deſcend ſo low, as to be angry, whenever they pleaſe to provoke us. <hi>Agathocles</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> made a jeſt of thoſe that affronted them, and ſcorned to puniſh them, when they had them at their mercy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a peculiar Excellence this way: <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the other celebrated Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Virtue in Holy Writ have done ſo too.<note n="†" place="bottom">Magnam fortunam magnus animus decet.</note> 
                                 <hi>A great Poſt ſhould have a great Soul to fill it.</hi> The nobleſt Conqueſt is to ſubdue our ſelves, and to leave it in the power of no other Perſon to diſorder us. Flying into Paſſion is a ſhrewd ſymptom of Guilt; and a Conſciouſneſs, that we deſerve all the indignities put upon us. He cannot be a truly great Man, who bends under another Man's ill treatment; a Conqueſt there muſt be on ſome ſide; for if we do not ſubdue our Anger, it will ſubdue us; and therefore the only way to preſerve our Liberty, and our Honour, is to get above this
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:53648:635"/>rebellious Paſſion and<note n="†" place="bottom">Injurias &amp; offenſiones ſupreme deſpicere.</note> look down upon the Tempeſts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering below with ſcorn and Contempt.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond diviſion of remedies conſiſts of ſuch as are fit to be made uſe of, at the time when any provocations to this paſſion are offered to us, and when we feel it is going to make inſurrection. And theſe are, 1. keeping the body conſtantly in one poſture, and not allowing our ſelves in the leaſt motion; ſitting ſilent, and keeping our thoughts within our own Breaſts. For any ſort of agitation of our Limbs, Hands, Feet, but eſpecially of the Tongue, ſets the blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours preſently into a ferment, and kindles a ſire in the Soul. The beginning of contention is like the letting out of water, and it is the ſecond word that makes the quarrel. 2. A prudent reſerve; backwardneſs in crediting what we hear; ſlowneſs in reſolving; allowing ſpace to think and conſider and ſtate the merits of the cauſe, and ſuſpending our determination and reſentment till all this be fairly done: For could we once but bring our ſelves to reaſon upon the point, we ſhould preſently give a check to this growing Fever. A Philoſopher adviſed <hi>Auguſtus</hi> never to let his anger looſe, till he had firſt repeated the Letters of the Alphabet; and ſome Chriſtians have given the ſame counſel in effect, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the diverſion they preſcribe when they direct us to ſay over the Lord's Prayer, before we give any vent to the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling paſſion: All we ſay and do in heat, ſhould be ſhrewdly ſuſpected and carefully watched, and therefore it is but fit we ſhould make a halt<note n="*" place="bottom">Nihil tibi liceat dum iraſceris; Quare? Quia vis omnia lice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                                    </gap>.</note>. <hi>Allow your ſelf in nothing when you are angry, becauſe there is nothing ſo ill, which you would not at ſuch a time be content to allow your ſelf.</hi> We ought to be afraid and extreamly jealous of our ſelves, for while our minds are in diſorder, it is impoſſible we ſhould do any thing properly and as we ought. Reaſon at ſuch a time is intangled in the paſſions, and can do us no more ſervice than wings do a Bird whoſe feet are faſt in the Lime-twigs: we may flutter and ſtruggle, but ſhall very hardly be able to extricate our ſelves by all the efforts we can make; and therefore we ſhould never truſt our ſelves, but take ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the company of ſome friend, and there mellow
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:53648:635"/>and compoſe our paſſions by his calm advice and wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. 4. Another good expedient, when we feel the ſtorm gathering, will be to divert and diſperſe it, by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is agreeable and entertaining; and in this caſe no diverſion is better than Muſick to ſmooth and ſweeten the paſſions, and by a kind of Sympathetick power to make perfect harmony and true concord in the Soul.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third parcel conſiſts of ſome good conſiderations, which the Soul ought to be tinctured and throughly ſeaſoned with beforehand. As firſt, a contemplation of the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and wild diſorderly motions of perſons in paſſion, thoſe indecencies and deformities which may very reaſonably be expected to beget in us a mighty averſion to it. Upon this account ſome of the Philoſopers adviſe angry Men to look in the Glaſs, and to ſatisfie their own ſenſes how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly theſe exceſſes disfigure them. Secondly, let us alſo fix our eyes and hearts upon the charming, the admirable beauties of meekneſs and moderation. Obſerve, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding graceful and becoming a mild and ſweet temper ſhews, how engaging to others, how beneficial to our ſelves; for this well conſidered, would prove a powerful Loadſtone, and attract the affections of all the beholders. This advice is more eſpecially expedient for perſons of quality and high rank, becauſe fortune hath placed them on high, made them more conſpicuous than the reſt of Mankind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greater care ſhould be taken to ſet off all their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with decency and to the beſt advantage: For as their actions are of greater and more general concernment, ſo their faults have a more pernicious influence and are leſs to be retrieved than thoſe of common Men. Laſtly, there is the regard we ought to have for Wiſdom and virtue, that ſcience which it is the buſineſs and deſign of this little book to train men up in; for indeed Philoſophy and Religion ſhew themſelves in no one inſtance ſo much as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Paſſions, and the preſerving our minds firm and ſteady and impregnable. We ſhould raiſe our Souls up above this earth, and bring them to a temperament and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition like that of the upper regions of the air, which is never darkened by clouds, nor agitated by ſtorms, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by thunder, but quiet and ſerene, and always the ſame. Thus neither ſhould this Soul, this Coeleſtial and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine part of us be blackned with grief, or diſordered by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but kept in a gentle and uniform motion, conſiderate and ſlow, like the Orbs and Planets, which the higher they
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:53648:636"/>are the more ſoftly they move, and are freer from Precipitation, as they approach nearer to purity and perfection.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now it is neceſſary to inform my Reader, that all theſe directions are to be underſtood of thoſe inward reſentments and diſorders, which are kept cloſe and cheriſhed in our minds, and thoſe heart-burnings which kindle a long and laſting fire in our breaſts, and break out in uncharitable grudges, bitter hatred and averſion, and furious deſires of revenge. For as to that other ſort of anger which is outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſhort blaze quickly in and as quickly out again, where there is no malice, no reſentment left behind, and the only deſign of it is to make others ſenſible of their faults, whether our inferiours by chaſtiſements and ſmart reproofs, or thoſe upon the level with us, by expoſtulating with them and ſhewing the injuſtice or indiſcretions they have been guilty of; this is of infinite uſe, highly neceſſary to be put in practice, and exceeding commendable when rightly managed.</p>
                              <p>It is much for the advantage both of our ſelves and of thoſe with whom we converſe, to be thus angry upon ſome occaſions, provided always we keep within the bounds of moderation and prudent conduct; and a little vehemence does well to awaken people into a better ſenſe. There are a ſort of people who value themſelves upon reſtraining ſuch reſentments, and keeping in their paſſion as they call it; which though very convenient when we have our ſuperiours to engage with, or ſuch as we have reaſon to be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of giving any offence to, yet is no good rule for our general behaviour: They who boaſt of it, make indeed large pretenſions to temper and government of their paſſions, and are mighty Philoſophers in their own eyes and eſteem; but yet they frequently burn and fret inwardly, and gain a Conqueſt upon themſelves, which coſts them more than the thing is worth: It were much better to give it vent, and let their reſentments flame out a little now and then, than that they ſhould glow and torment them within. For this covering of our anger incorporates and makes it of a piece with our Souls, and the haſty Man is much rather to be commended when ſoon pacified again, than the fretful and moroſe, the ſullen and the ſilent. If this weapon muſt wound ſomewhere, it were much more adviſable to draw it upon others, and give them a ſlight hurt, than that the Point ſhould be turned back upon our ſelves and ſtab us to the heart.<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnia vitia in aperto leviora ſunt, &amp; tunc pernicioſiſtima, cum ſimulatâ ſanitate ſubſidunt.</note>
                                 <pb n="667" facs="tcp:53648:636"/>
                                 <hi>All vices are leſs dangerous when the effects of them are viſible and apparent, but never ſo deſtructive as then, when they lurk ſecretly and impoſe upon us by an artificial and counterfeit vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> Thus a ſore skinned over and rankling underneath threatens ill conſequences, and wounds are laid open to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Mortification.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And as theſe outward demonſtrations of anger may be for our own caſe, ſo may they likewiſe be capable of doing great ſervice to other people; upon ſuch perſons eſpecially as will not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded and argued into their duty. For with Servants and thoſe who are actuated by no other principle but fear, there is an abſolute neceſſity of either feeling or at leaſt putting on ſomewhat of warmth and reſentments; otherwiſe all order would be loſt, and nothing done under our inſpection as it ought to be. But then thoſe expreſſions of Anger muſt be ſure to have theſe following qualifications: 1. The returns of them muſt not come too thick, nor be provoked upon every ſlight occaſion; for uſe will harden thoſe to whom they are directed; alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are never to be made by any thing that is grown fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; nor can we ſave that authority from contempt, which interpoſes with eagerneſs and violence upon trivial and inſignificant miſcarriages. 2. They ſhould not be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom-ſhot nor loſt in the Air; not ſpent in fretting or vexing our ſelves, or railing and reproaching them behind their backs, but diſcharged upon the perſon who gave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, that he may feel the ſmart of his own folly. 3. They ſhould be delivered gravely and pertinently, and carry ſomewhat of tartneſs and ſting with them, without any mixture of Jeſting or Laughing, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of our being in very good earneſt, and ſtir them up effectually to better care for the future, as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for what is already paſſed. In one word, this ſort of Anger is in the nature of Phyſick, and it will be our wiſdom ſo to time and ſo to apply it, that it may have a kindly Operation and work a thorough Cure in the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>

                              <p>TO defend our ſelves effectually from the inſults of this Paſſion, we ſhall do well to bear conſtantly in mind that old rule of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> (and a moſt excellent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſervation it is) <hi>That every thing hath two handles, and that every Man hath it in his choice, whether of them be will lay hold of it by;</hi> Take it by one and it will ſeem heavy and grievous, but by the other it will be light and eaſie to us. Let us rather be ſure to take every thing by the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handle, and look upon it in the moſt advantageous light. That is, put the beſt and moſt favourable interpretation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that happens to us, and ſo ſhall we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that what we hate and find fault with hath a great deal to ſoften and recommend it to our acceptance. For Providence hath in infinite wiſdom ſo ordered the matter, that there is not any one accident poſſible to us in this World, which a dextrous and skillful Man may not turn to ſome account. And even in that which gives us greateſt offence, there is more ſubject for lamentation and complaint than there can be for hatred and juſt Averſion. He who does an ill or unbecoming thing to us, hath done the firſt wrong, and ſuffered the greateſt damage in it himſelf: For he hath loſt the uſe of his Reaſon and betrayed his own virtue, which are injuries ſo ſubſtantial that nothing we can ſuffer at ſecond hand can be comparable to them. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take this accident in another proſpect, and view it there; let us give a freſh turn to our Paſſion, and change Hatred into Piety; let us take pains to make the perſons who have tempted us to hate them worthy of our love and eſteem. Thus <hi>Lycurgus</hi> is ſaid to have dealt with a Man that put out his eye; inſtead of proſecuting ſo ſenſible an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:53648:637"/>he took another courſe of puniſhing him, which was by his ſevere remonſtrances and good inſtructions to render him a vertuous, modeſt, and peaceable Perſon ever after.</p>

                              <p>IN oppoſition to this fretful and tormenting Paſſion, let us conſider and weigh nicely the nature of the thing we ſet ſo high a value upon, and grudge another the fruition of. We are apt to envy our more proſperous Neighbours, their Riches and Honours, their Preferments and the favour of Great Men: But all this is reaſoning without Book, and want of attending to the condition of the purchaſe; we are not ſenſible how dear theſe things have coſt their owners. Were this rightly underſtood, it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if they were offered to us upon the ſame terms, we ſhould think it our wiſdom to decline ſtriking the bargain. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Attendance, Anxiety and Care, Sufferings and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, Affronts and Repulſes, loſs of Liberty, and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous compliances with the Paſſions and Pleaſures of thoſe we make our court to; Violations of Juſtice and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our own Conſciences, theſe are uſually the price ſuch advantages come at: Thus much however is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is nothing in this World worth the having which can be had for nothing. To hope for Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a Plentiful Eſtate, or a gainful Office upon other Terms than they uſually go at, is to deſire that we may be made an exception to the reſt of Mankind; to repeal an Univerſal Law; or at leaſt to break and pervert a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuſtom received and eſtabliſhed all the World over: It is taking the Commodity and keeping our Money too. Why ſhould you then who ſet up for the Character of Honour and Virtue be diſcontented, becauſe you are not poſſeſt of thoſe advantages which are never to be acquired but by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and reproachful methods, and muſt be bought at the expence of Modeſty and Decency? If this be the caſe, theſe ſplendid appearances call rather for your Pity than your Envy: Either the Object of your Paſſion is a real Good, or it is not; if it be a fantaſtical and imaginary good only, it is beneath this reſentment, nay it is inconſiſtent with
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:53648:638"/>it. For no Man is envious upon a ſuppoſition of a treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deceitful outſide, but upon an implication of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and intrinſick worth: But if it have this, and be a feal and ſolid good, then ought it to be matter of Joy and Pleaſure. For the Laws of Humanity, and thoſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity much more oblige us to deſire, and take delight in one another's Happineſs; and the exerciſe of this Virtue with regard to other peoples ſatisfaction and good Fortune would be a very conſiderable addition to our own.</p>

                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> FOr the beating down this cruel paſſion, ſeveral Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations may be of uſe to us; as firſt of all, That there is not any action of our Lives ſo truly honourable and glorious as that of pardoning and paſſing by injuries and affronts, nor any attaintment which requires greater skill than this to maſter and excuſe it readily and gracefully. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body knows but too well how to proſecute Wrongs and demand Satisfaction; but the remitting and receiving thoſe that have done them into grace again, is a Glory reſerved for Princes, and truly great Souls: If then thou wilt prove thy Soveraignty, ſhew that thou art King of thy ſelf, and do a truly royal act by forgiving freely, and extending thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe that have moſt juſtly merited thy diſpleaſure.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Remember that this is of all others the nobleſt Conqueſt, to convince the World that thou art impregnable, and above the reach or reſentment of injuries and Affronts. For by this means they all rebound back again upon the head of the Author; and like blows upon Anvils when they make no impreſſion, only benumb and put the party to pain, who laid about him with ſuch impotent malice and fury. To continue Revenge, is to give our Enemy the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of knowing that he hath hurt us; and he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains declares himſelf worſted in the Controverſie. So ſay the Moraliſt;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ultio doloris confeſſio eſt; non eſt magnus animus, quem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvat Injuria. Ingens animus &amp; verus aeſtimator ſui non vindicat injuriam, quia non ſentit.</note> 
                                 <hi>He that is impatient for ſatisfaction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:53648:638"/>himſelf in pain; that Soul cannot be truly great, which bends beneath an Injury: A generous Spirit, and one that truly values himſelf, never revenges a wrong, becauſe he is too big to feel the ſmart of it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> You will reply perhaps, that it is very hard though to ſuffer Injuries and Offences; grievous in it ſelf, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the World; I know it very well, and therefore my Advice is, that you would not ſuffer them; but vanquiſh and get ſo abſolute a maſtery over them, that nothing of this kind ſhould reach up to you. And this to be done in a fair and honourable way, by diſdaining the thing and the Perſon that is guilty of it; or, if you pleaſe, advancing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt higher ſtill, and reclaiming him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for both theſe good Qualities: No Victory is ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, none ſo triumphant, as that which makes your Enemy buckle under you by kindneſs undeſerved: That which lays him with his mouth in the Duſt, and ſtrikes him dumb at his own Baſeneſs, and ſo ſhames his Spight into Friendſhip: For what can melt him, if this will not? What can deſerve Laurels ſo juſtly, as the being thus invincible, and not ſuffering any Aggravations an Injury is capable of, to ſtop our hands, or get the better of Virtue and Reaſon? This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a Reſolution we ſhould ſettle to our ſelves, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that the more grievous the Crime, and the bitterer and more implacable the Spight, the more fit it is for us to pardon it: And the better we could juſtifie taking a ſevere Revenge, the more it makes for our Honour and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to take none at all.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Remember how great a Contradiction it is to all Equity and Reaſon, that the ſame Perſon ſhould be Judge and Party both in the ſame Cauſe; and yet this is an Abſurdity, which every one that undertakes to revenge his own Quarrels una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably runs upon. This ought therefore conſtantly to be left to the Arbitration of a third Perſon, or at leaſt a Man ſhould never take it into his own hands, without adviſing with his Friends; following ſuch meaſures, as they who are calm and indifferent Judges, think proper; and not leaning to the raſh, and hot determinations of our own diſordered Minds. The Old Poetical Fables have given us a beautiful Repreſentation of this Matter, in their accounts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deities, and the Limitations of their reſpective Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Powers. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they tell you, hath a right to caſt ſuch Thunderbolts, as are favourable to Mankind, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend good Events, by vertue of his own Deſpotick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:53648:639"/>But when any Thunder is to be diſcharged upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, and thoſe Bolts are let fly, which carry Devaſtation and Ruin, and any ſort of miſchievous Effects; This he hath no right to do of his own head, nor without the advice and aſſiſtance of twelve Gods met in Counſel. This was a very ſignificant Thought, and ſhewed the importance of the Occaſion; That even the Supreme of all the Heavenly Powers, who had unlimited Commiſſion to do good to all the World of his own head, ſhould yet have it reſtrained, and his hands tied up from hurting; ſo much as one ſingle Perſon, till the matter and merits of the Cauſe had been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly debated. But the Reaſon couched at the bottom, deſerves our attention: Kindneſs and Beneficence there can be no danger in, no miſtakes, no exceſſes of this kind are pernicious; But when Revenge and Puniſhment come under Deliberation, this is ſo nice a point, that even the wiſdom of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf was not ſecure from all poſſibility of Errour; and therefore an aſſembly of diſ-intereſted Perſons was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to direct and moderate his Anger.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And this Moderation and Temper is what every Man ſhould make it his Buſineſs to acquire, and be well fixed in: Which with reſpect to the caſe now before us, is but another name for Clemency. For by that I mean, ſuch a mildneſs and ſweetneſs of Spirit; ſuch an inclination to forgive and be kind, as curbs and holds in the violent Careers of Paſſion; and makes us move coolly and regularly. This will arm us with Patience, will convince us that we cannot be injured in reality, except from our own ſelves; and that for the wrongs others maliciouſly intend us, ſo much and no more will ſtick, as we faſten and bind upon our ſelves by reſenting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. This will ſecure us the good will, and affections of all Mankind; and will ſeaſon all our Behaviour with that Modeſty and Decency that cannot fail to render our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation innocent, courteous and agreeable, and univerſally deſired.</p>

                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THe only method of any Efficacy for avoiding this Paſſion, is to take care to deſerve the advantage we deſire. For Jealouſie is little elſe at the bottom, but the diſtruſt and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:53648:639"/>of ones own Mind; and an Argument, that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of our own want of merit. When the Emperour <hi>Aurelius</hi> was asked by his Wife <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> what he would do, if his Enemy <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſhould win the Field, his anſwer was, <hi>I do not ſerve the Gods ſo ill, that they ſhould have ſuch an Affliction in reſerve for me.</hi> So they that partake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Affection, and are tempted to any ſuſpicion of loſing it, will do well to ſilence ſuch uneaſie Suggeſtions, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves, The Regard I have for him is ſo ſincere, that I dare be confident he will not rob me of a treaſure I value ſo highly. An aſſurance of our own faithfulneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving better uſage, is the beſt pledge of our Friend's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fidelity to us in return.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He that purſues a Prize virtuouſly, will be content, that others ſhould ſeek it in the ſame way. For this does but ſerve to awaken, and illuſtrate, and exalt his worth. Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only creates fear of Rivals, becauſe this ſuſpects, that when we come to have our merits laid in the balance with thoſe of other Competitors, our Imperfections will be more diſtinctly ſeen, and we ſhall ſuffer by the Compariſon. Whereas otherwiſe, if you take away Emulation, you eclipſe the honour of Virtue, and quench the moſt powerful Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to good and gallant actions.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As to that particular kind of Jealouſie between Married Perſons; the Counſel expedient to be given on the Man's part ſeems to be this. That if any reproach happen to them from the diſloyalty of their Wives, they ſhould recollect, what great and renowned Fellow-ſufferers they have had in this Calamity; who yet bore it with exemplary patience, and made no words of their Misfortune. Such were <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Caeſar, Pompey, Cato, Auguſtus, Antony,</hi> and a great many beſides. But you will ſay, the World hath diſcovered your ſhame, and it is grown common talk. And pray, who is there, that the World does not talk of to their prejudice, more or leſs, whether they have any ground for ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or no? How many Perſons of Honour and Virtue have you your ſelf heard branded with the infamous Title? If you make a buſtle, and blaze abroad your Diſgrace, the Ladies will only have the advantage of the better Jeſt. And the commonneſs of this Affliction one would think, ſhould long ago have worn out all the uneaſineſs of it. But however, put the worſt of the Caſe, that you are in reality the thing you ſuſpect; yet how is this a juſt Calamity? it is no reflection upon your Virtue, or your Wiſdom; the
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:53648:640"/>World is moſt unreaſonable and abſurd in loading the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon with Infamy, and rendring that ridiculous, which is in no degree a Fault. But if they will proceed by wrong meaſures, your own breaſt ſhould follow thoſe that are right and equitable. Nay, even in reſpect of others, there is ſome remedy left ſtill: For it is in your own power to render your Virtue ſo illuſtrious, that it ſhall ſtifle and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up this Misfortune; and make your name never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, among Wiſe and Good Men at leaſt, with one whit the leſs Eſteem. They will cover your Infamy by their juſt Commendations, and curſe the wicked occaſion of it; who is ſo much the more profligate, and abandoned, deſpicable and deteſtable, for uſing a Good Man ill.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As to the Women, they are not ſo eaſily ſatisfied, becauſe their very Nature ſeems more diſpoſed to Suſpicion and Curioſity. But the beſt Advice I can give them, is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble any apprehenſions of this kind; which is the true and prudent <hi>Medium</hi> between two very vicious and fooliſh Extremes. The one, that ſilly tormenting of themſelves, which devours their Spirits, deſtroys all their ſatisfaction, and flies out into tranſports of Fury and Rage. The other, that tame Negligence practiſed in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſome other Eaſtern Countries; where Wives uſe their utmoſt endeavours to advance the honour of their Husbands (which is there thought to conſiſt in the number of Wives and Miſtreſſes) or their ſatisfaction, or the increaſe of Poſterity, by turning Bawds and Procurers. This is a piece of ſervice, which I think they might very well be excuſed. But when all is done, the only cure for this Evil on both ſides, is ſuch an affectionate and diſcreet, ſuch a modeſt and reſerved Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as ſhall miniſter no manner of occaſion for calling the fidelity of either Party into queſtion.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> TEmperance is capable of a double Signification: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken in a general Senſe; for Moderation, and that Temper, which we commonly ſay ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:53648:640"/>in all manner of things whatſoever. In this compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Interpretation, it does not denote any one Virtue in particular, but the Complex of them all in common; and is that quality, which ſeaſons and gives a reliſh to good actions of every ſort. In this Latitude we are under perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to it, but chiefly ſo, in thoſe matters, that admit of Controverſie; and engage us in Differences and Diſputes. For the due obſervance of it thus underſtood, there needs but this ſingle Direction, of laying aſide all perſonal and ſelf-ended Conſiderations, and make it our entire buſineſs to ſtick cloſe to our Duty. For all lawful and commendable Affections are temperate; Hatred, and Anger, and Cruelty, are exceſſes much beyond the limits of Juſtice and Duty; and are only ſecond-hand Remedies, neceſſary to be uſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who refuſe to be kept to their Duty by the power of Reaſon, and the ſofter arts of Perſwaſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But when this Term is uſed in a more reſtrained Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then it imports a check and regulation of things plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful to Senſe; and ſuch as our natural and carnal Appetites eagerly long after, and are gratified by. At preſent we extend it a little farther, for the Rule and Meaſure of a Man's Duty in all kinds of Proſperity, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was ſaid to be in every ſort of Adverſity: So that Temperance ſupplies the place of a Bridle, and Fortitude that of a Spur; this checks our Carcer of Gayety, that quickened our ſluggiſh Fears, and rouzed us out of Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. With theſe two in Conjunction, we are able to manage that brutal, and reſtiff, and wild part of us, which conſiſts of the Paſſions; and ſhall not fail to demean our ſelves well and wiſely, in every condition, and change of Fortune: Which is in truth the very ſumm and ſubſtance of Wiſdom, and the very perfection I deſire my Reader ſhould aſpire to.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The general Object then of Temperance, is all manner of Proſperity; every thing that is pleaſurable and gay, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and more peculiarly Pleaſure, which this Virtue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates and retrenches. All that part, which is ſuperfluous and unnatural, and vicious, it pares quite away; and that which is natural and neceſſary, it keeps within due meaſures. Thus we find it deſcribed by an Old Author,<note n="*" place="bottom">Voluptatibus imperat, alias odit &amp; abigit, alias diſpenſat, &amp; ad ſanum modum redigit; nec unquam ad illas propter illas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit; ſcit optimum eſſe modum cupitorum, non quantum velis, ſed quantam debeas.</note>

Some ſhe deteſts and utterly diſcards, others ſhe corrects and diſtributes in their juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. She never chooſes any meerly for their own ſakes, and the beſt meaſure of gratifying our Appetites ſhe declares to be, the taking not ſo much of any of theſe Objects, as we have an inclination to, but ſo much only as is fit for us.</hi> This is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſuperintendance of Reaſon over thoſe eager and violent Affections, which carry our Wills towards Pleaſures and ſenſual Delights. The curb of our Soul, the inſtrument to ſcumm off thoſe Ebullitions, which by the Heat and Intemperance of the Blood are apt to boyl over; that ſo the Mind may be preſerved uniform, and in conſiſtence with Reaſon: And not debaſe it ſelf, by ſubmitting, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating its meaſures to ſenſible Objects, but preſerve its rightful Superiority; and force them to ſerve and ſute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Dictates of the Mind. By this we wean our Souls from the childiſh delights of the World, and qualifie them for a more ſubſtantial and generous ſuſtenance. In ſhort, it is a Rule, that ſquares all things by the proportions of Nature, Neceſſity, Simplicity, Eaſe, Health, and Strength, and Hardineſs: For theſe are things that commonly go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are the meaſures and bounds which Wiſdom ſets out. As on the other hand, Art, and Luxury, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, Variety, Multiplicity, Difficulty, Sickneſs, a weak and tender Conſtitution, bear one another company, and are the uſual attendants of Intemperance and Folly.<note n="*" place="bottom">Simplici curâ conſtant neceſſaria, in delicijs laboratur.

                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Proſperity is a State of infinite hazard and danger: As ſoon as ever this fair Gale begins to blow, all that is light, and empty in the Soul, is immediately carried up with the breath of it. Nothing hath ſo peſtilent an influence, to ſtupifie and ruin Men, and make them forget themſelves: They periſh, and are ſpoiled, like Corn born down by a full Ear, and Branches broke with exceſſive quantities of Fruit. And therefore it is neceſſary, a Man ſhould be ſenſible what ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ground he ſtands upon, and look to his ſteps according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but eſpecially he ſhould beware, that he be not carried to Inſolence and Contempt of others, Pride and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with regard to himſelf. Theſe are Vices ſo incident to Mankind, that the leaſt Temptation will ſuffice for them. And as ſome People (according to the Proverb) will be drowned in two foot of Water; ſo there are ſome too, who upon the leaſt ſmile of Fortune, ſwell and look big, ſcarce know themſelves, and are intolerable to all their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Of all the Pictures of Folly, which the World can furniſh us with, this ſeems to be drawn moſt like the Life.</p>

For Perſons in this Condition are for the moſt part ill-adviſed, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency makes frequent and quick Revolutions; changes the Scene from Joy and Grandeur, to Calamity, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Want; alienates the Affections of Providence; provokes Almighty God to take back again what Men make
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:53648:642"/>ſuch ill uſe of. To all which we may add the ſecret and undiſcernable Reaſons of his Diſpenſations, or, to expreſs the thing in a more ſecular Phraſe, that Inconſtancy of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which from a fond Mother changes her humour unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably to all the Severities of a cruel and curſed Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now the propereſt Advice upon this occaſion, is for a Man to reſtrain and moderate his Opinions and Affections of the good things of this World; not to eſteem them too highly, nor imagine himſelf one whit the better or the worſe Man, for the Enjoyment or the Want of them; and the natural Conſequence of this ſo low Valuation will be, not to deſire them with any degree of vehemence. If they fall to his Lot, to accept them as the Gift of a bountiful Maſter; and to ſerve him with them thankfully and cheerfully; but always to look upon theſe, as foreign and additional Advantages; no neceſſary, no inſeparable part of Life: Such as he might have been very well without, and ſuch, as, while he hath them, are not to be made any great account of, or ſuffered to change the temper of his Mind, either higher or lower.

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> BY Pleaſure I underſtand a Perception, or Senſation of that which is agreeable to Nature; a delightful Motion or tickling of the Senſes; as, on the contrary, by Pain is meant ſome diſagreeable Senſation, which produces Sorrow, and is grievous to Nature. But thoſe Philoſophers, (as the Sect of the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> in particular,) who reſolved the chief Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Man into Pleaſure, and paid it greater Honour than we think fit to do, took it in another Signification, and
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:53648:642"/>extended the thing no farther than a privation of Grief or Uneaſineſs, ſuch as they thought ſit to expreſs by Indolence. According to their notion, humane Nature was capable of riſing no higher, than the not being uneaſie. This is a ſort of middle State, a Neutrality between the firſt and vulgar acceptation of the Word, and Pain: And bears the ſame Proportion, with regard to this Life, which ſome Divines have thought <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom does to the next; A Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the exquiſite Happineſs of Heaven, and the extreme Torments of Hell. 'Tis a ſweet and peaceable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateneſs of Body and Mind; an uniform, conſtant, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pleaſure; which carries ſome reſemblance to that <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> or tranquility of Soul, which other Philoſophers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed our chief Good: Whereas the other is an active and ſenſible Pleaſure, full of vigorous and ſprightly motion. At this rate, there would be three diſtinct Conditions, of which Mankind are capable; two in extremes, Pleaſure and Pain; which are neither ſtable nor durable, but both of them ſickly, and in exceſs; the Mean between them firm, and ſound, healthful and permanent; to which the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> attributed the name of Pleaſure, (and ſuch indeed it is, when compared with Pain) and placed the ſupreme happineſs of our Nature in it. This unhappy Name brought that general ſcandal upon their Sect, which the oppoſite Parties of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers inſult over with ſo much Pomp and Triumph. For after all, (as <hi>Seneca</hi> with great Ingenuity confeſſes,) there was no hurt but in the Name; no offence, but what was meerly Titular; for to thoſe who will be at the pains of a nice Examination into their Lives and Manners, it will appear, that none ever advanced Doctrines of ſtricter Sobriety, none were greater Enemies to Vice and all manner of Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, none more diſtant from thoſe Reproaches to a rational Soul, than the Men of this Profeſſion. Nor indeed was it without a fair appearance of Reaſon, that they gave this name of Pleaſure to that ſo much exalted Indolence of theirs. For this Titillation of the Senſe comes at laſt to this, and ſeems to make it the ultimate end and aim of all the more feeling ſatisfactions we find in it; as for inſtance, the delight we find in Meats and Drinks, pretends to nothing more, than to deliver us from that torture and thoſe eager cravings, which Hunger and Thirſt had brought upon us; and, by ſatifying the Appetite, to place us in a Condition of Eaſe and Repoſe, till the ſame Wants return again upon us.</p>
                           <pb n="680" facs="tcp:53648:643"/>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The learned World have behaved themſelves very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently upon this occaſion. They have determined very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily on both ſides, and, (as is uſual, with hot and poſitive People,) have both over-ſhot the Mark: Some have perfectly adored Pleaſure, and exalted it into a Deity; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pretend the greateſt Deteſtation of it, and expoſe it for a Monſter: They ſtart and tremble at the very Name, and cannot allow it to import any thing but what is full of Guilt, and a Scandal to humane Nature. Thoſe who condemn it without more ado, proceed to Sentence upon theſe following Conſiderations. They tell you, that it is, Firſt, a ſhort and tranſitory Enjoyment, a fire of Thorns, kindled and extinct in a moment, eſpecially if it be vigorous and exquiſite; for in proportion as you add to the Degree, ſo much you take off from the duration of it. Secondly, That it is a nice and tender thing, the leaſt Accident corrupts and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters it; that a drop of Pain will ſowr an ocean of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Thirdly, That it is mean and baſe, attended with ſhame, and attained by thoſe parts of our Body, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath placed out of ſight, as if ſhe were out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at the gratifying our own Inclinations. This however is true but of ſome Pleaſures; for there are ſome, which affect Pomp and Oſtentation. Fourthly, That we are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloyed with it. Men are formed in ſuch a manner, that their Conſtitutions will not bear the long continuance of any exalted Pleaſure. There is a certain Impatience attends it, and we ſoon grow weary of what we moſt eagerly deſired but juſt before. Whereas, on the contrary, Nature hath made us hard and tough, and able to weather out very long Pains, as hath been obſerved formerly: This ſhort Pleaſure too, is often followed by long Remorſe; it produces mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Miſchiefs, and is more fruitful in nothing, than in the ruin of ſingle Perſons, and Families, and whole Countries. But the fault they inſiſt moſt upon, is, That, when Men are moſt intent upon gratifying it, it does ſo entirely poſſeſs and tyrannize over them, that it uſurps the whole Man, and will not ſo much as admit Reaſon to interpoſe, or ſhare in the Entertainment.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> On the other hand, the Advocates of Pleaſure plead not guilty to this Indictment, and alledge in defence of their Cauſe; That Pleaſure is natural, created by Almighty God himſelf, and contrived for the good of the World, made ſubſervient to the Preſervation and continuance of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Nature, which is the Parent of Pleaſure, ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:53648:643"/>of its neceſſity, in that all the actions, by which Life is ſuſtained, are ſeaſoned with, and recommended by it. And yet all Philoſophy hath allowed, that the way to live well, is to follow the Dictates of Nature. God placed Man, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtate of Innocence, in a place and condition richly, furniſhed with vaſt variety of Delights: And the very name given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to Paradiſe, is in the Hebrew Language <hi>Pleaſure:</hi> And not only ſo, but,<note place="margin">Eden.</note> if we raiſe our Eyes and Thoughts above this World to the higheſt perfection, which Religion bids us aſpire after. What are the felicities of the Saints above, but a laſting, and uninterrupted Series of Pleaſure? <hi>They ſhall be filled with the Pleaſures of thy Houſe, and thou ſhalt give them Drink out of thy Pleaſures, as out of the River,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, when he would deſcribe the Satisfactions of the holieſt Men. Theſe, I confeſs, do not mean thoſe groſs and carnal Satisfactions, which this Term is abuſively made to denote; but it ought not by any means to be confined within that compaſs, as if nothing that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generous and great could be intended by it. Theſe things ought to be included, when we ſpeak in vindication of Pleaſure; and the other have no reaſon to be diſdained, when regulated by Equity and Reaſon. And, accordingly we find, that the moſt renowned Philoſophers, and acknowledged patterns of Virtue, ſuch as <hi>Zeno, Cato, Scipio, Epaminondas, Plato,</hi> and the Immortal <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf, did not think it below them to taſt the Comforts and Diverſions of Life; nay, deſcended ſo far, as even to Diſcourſe, and write Tracts of thoſe, which ſome now by an affected nicety, pretend to accuſe, (as you have heard,) and would in their mighty, but miſtaken zeal for Virtue, fain baniſh out of the World, under the odious Character of Pleaſures of Senſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Since therefore Wiſe Men have been ſo much divided in their Opinions upon this Subject, it will be neceſſary for us to proceed cautiouſly; and to diſtinguiſh theſe Pleaſures into their ſeveral ſorts; without which we ſhall never be able to come to any juſt and true Reſolution of the Caſe ariſing hereupon; nor ſatisfie our ſelves, which are lawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or how far any are ſo. Firſt then, we muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that ſome Pleaſures are natural, and others unnatural; This Diſtinction being of all the reſt moſt important to our preſent purpoſe, will be conſidered more particularly by and by. Some again are pompous, and ſhowy, nice and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; others are ſilent and ſecret, eaſie and ready at hand. Pleaſure is not ambitious of Splendor and Obſervation, but
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:53648:644"/>eſteems her own ſolitary Enjoyments, Wealth enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concerning her ſelf what other People think of her; and enjoys her ſelf more in Retirement, than in the eye of the World. Thoſe again, that are ſo very eaſie, as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at our command, grow flat, and nauſeous, and loſe all their reliſh, except there be now and then a little Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieneſs or Obſtruction, to ſet an edge upon our Appetite. There are likewiſe ſpiritual, and corporeal Pleaſures: The ground of which Diſtinction is not any real Separation ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being made between them; for Pleaſure of every kind affects the whole Man; and extends to every part of the Compoſition; and one part hath not any one reſentment peculiar to it ſelf, which the other does not likewiſe ſhare in; nor can have while this intimate Union of Soul and Body continues the preſent Life to us. But that which is the true foundation of this Diſtinction, is, that there are ſome Sentiments, which affect the Mind, more than they do the Body, and may therefore very fitly be called manly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; as being more proper to us, better ſuited to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and powers of Perception, than they are to thoſe of Beaſts; And, as they are more worthy in reſpect of the Faculties they are commenſurate to, ſo are they likewiſe more ſteady and durable. Such, for inſtance, are thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, which enter at our Eyes, and Ears; for theſe two Senſes are the Doors of the Soul, and the Objects they receive, only paſs through there, in their way to the Soul; which entertains, feeds upon, and digeſts them, and finds long Refreſhments and Delights from them. But the Body taſts but a very little part of theſe Satisfactions: Others again, the Body ingroſſes almoſt wholly to it ſelf; ſuch as thoſe of the Touch, and the Taſte; which are more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and of a courſer Compoſition: Such as Brutes keep us Company in. And ſuch Pleaſures are received, performed, and finiſhed, by the Body, and its Organs. The Mind hath no other advantage in them, than by Reflection only; and what muſt needs belong to it, while it continues an aſſiſtant and Companion to the Body. And theſe are ſhort, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, the crackling of Thorns, the flaſh of a Meteor; born, and bred up, and dead in a moment.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now the main thing we are concerned to know upon this occaſion, is, how it will become us to behave our ſelves in the fruition and government of our Pleaſures. This is the Leſſon, that Philoſophy pretends to teach, and the particular difficulty Temperance makes proviſion againſt. And here
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:53648:644"/>firſt, we ought to put a very great difference between natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and unnatural Pleaſures: By the unnatural, I do not underſtand thoſe only, which are contrary to Nature, and ſuch uſages as the Laws have eſtabliſhed and approved; but even thoſe which are the moſt natural of all others, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this Title, in caſe they degenerate, and run out into Superfluity and great Exceſſes. For theſe things are not within the Verge of Nature, for She concerns her ſelf no farther, than meerly to ſupply our Neceſſities and real Wants, which (however) we have leave to enlarge a little, and that we may not complain of ſcanty meaſure, are free to conſult Convenience and common Decency. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is a natural Pleaſure, to be ſheltered by a good tight Houſe, and to have our Nakedneſs covered with good warm Cloaths; for theſe ſecure our Perſons from Wind and Weather, and bitter pinching Blaſts; and are ſome defence againſt the attempts of wicked Villains. But now, that thoſe Cloaths ſhould be of Tiſſue or Embroidery, or that Houſe built of Jaſper and Porphyry; this there is no occaſion for, and the ſatisfaction which would reſult from their being ſuch, is not any natural Pleaſure. Again, they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, if they do not come to us in the way, and method of Nature; as, if they are ſought with Anxiety and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, procured by Artifice, prepared by Medicines, or any other Stratagems of humane device and invention, to create, to heighten, to force, either the Appetite, or the Pleaſure by which it is gratified. So they are likewiſe, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and beaten out originally in the Mind, by the ſtrength of imagination, or the violence of Paſſion, and ſo are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards communicated to the Body; which is juſt inverting the order of Nature: For the uſual Courſe is, that Pleaſure ſhould begin in the Body, and from thence paſs on to the Mind. And indeed, as that Laughter, which is forced by Tickling, is not natural nor pleaſant, but rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion and violence upon Nature; ſo that Pleaſure, which is courted, and induſtriouſly contrived, kindled up firſt in the Soul, and from thence deſcending to the Body, is not a regular and natural Pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now the firſt Rule, which Wiſdom would preſcribe with regard to Pleaſures, is, to condemn, and utterly abandon all the Unnatural, as Vicious, and Spurious; and to allow and entertain ſuch as are Natural. For, as thoſe who come to a Feaſt without any invitation, ſhould be turned home again; ſo thoſe Pleaſures, that obtrude themſelves upon us, without
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:53648:645"/>even being bidden by Nature, are to be looked upon as Buſie-bodies and Smell-feaſts, and either denied entrance, or thruſt out of Doors again. But neither may we think our ſelves at liberty, to entertain the true Gueſts as we pleaſe, for even theſe muſt be treated by Rule, and with Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus you have the Duty and Buſineſs of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in general laid before you at once; The whole of which may be reduced to theſe two good Offices; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all unnatural Pleaſures, and regulating thoſe that are natural.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Now the Regulation of natural Pleaſures will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the due Obſervance of theſe three Rules.

                                    <hi>Firſt,</hi> That whatever we indulge our ſelves in, be no way Offenſive, or Scandalous, Injurious or Prejudicial to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon. For where any of theſe is the plain and natural Conſequence of the thing, we muſt forbid our ſelves the fruition of it, and ſeek out ſome more innocent and unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Entertainments.</item>

                                    <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Liberty be not to a Man's own Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, by impairing his Health, caſting a Blemiſh upon his Reputation, devouring his Time, encroaching upon his Duty, or being diſagreeable and unbecoming his Office and Character in the World.</item>

                                    <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That even thoſe, which are clear of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inconveniencies, be taken in due meaſure and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and our Affections moderated with regard to them. As we are not to act againſt the grain in all we do, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we lay any of thoſe things which are moſt with it, too cloſe to our Hearts; we ſhould neither court our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor run away from them; neither be averſe to them, nor doatingly fond of them: But take their Sweets, as we do that of Honey; a drop or two upon the Tip of our Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not lay it in by whole handfulls; not engage too deep in them, I mean, nor make them our Buſineſs, and the main deſign of Life; much leſs intoxicate and loſe our ſelves in them. For theſe are additional Comforts, Recreations and Diverſions only, to render our Continuance here eaſie, and give us a better reliſh of Life; to refreſh and recruit our Spirits, and ſuſtain them under the Fatigues of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome World: As Sleep is intended to make us forget our cares a while, and inſpire us with new vigour; that we may return to our work again, and be more ſprightly and freſh in Buſineſs. In a word, they are made to uſe, and not to live upon. But eſpecially, we ought to be very vigilant,
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:53648:645"/>and guard our ſelves ſtrictly, againſt their deceitful Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For many of them are bought at too dear a rate, and do us more hurt, than all their ſatisfactions can ever compenſate. They leave a Sting behind, and create laſting Remorſe, and great Diſquiets of Heart: And this is done after a very ſubtle and treacherous manner. They put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forward, and amuſe and cheat us by ſome preſent Gratifications, but hide the Hook that lies under this Bait. They put on the Face of Friends to cover their murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Intentions; careſs and embrace us with a ſeeming ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affection, but hug us ſo cloſe with a deſign to ſtrangle us. Thus the Pleaſures of Intemperance go before the Pains and ſick Qualms of it; and thus do the generality of thoſe Delights, which heat of Youth is ſo prone to, and plunges it ſelf ſo unwarily in. Then we venture in over head and ears, but when we are drowned in them, the Infirmities of Old Age ſucceed; and then they forſake us quite, and leave a miſerable Spectacle behind them, as the tide of Ebb does its Nuiſances and Carkaſſes upon the Shore. The delicious Morſels, which were ſwallowed ſo greedily, turn to Gall and Choler upon our oppreſſed Stomachs, and end in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and bitter Reflections. And the Dregs of our foul and polluted Enjoyments ſtick faſt to our Souls, and, by their poyſonous corroding quality, infect and corrupt our Diſpoſitions, and ſettle into ill habits, and inveterate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</item>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Now, as Moderation and Regularity in our Pleaſures, is a moſt decent and beautiful, a moſt uſeful and profitable thing, agreeable to the Laws of God, the deſign of Nature, and the dictates of Reaſon: So on the contrary, Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Exceſſes of all ſorts are odious and deformed, hateful to God and Man, and the moſt deſtructive that can be, both to the publick Good, and Men's own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Pleaſure unduly taken ſoftens and enervates the Soul, enervates and preys upon the Body, makes Fools of the Wiſe, and Cowards of the Brave. What a lamentable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this was <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whoſe Courage was more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Luxuries of <hi>Capita,</hi> than by the rugged Paſſes of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> or all the Efforts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies? This gave occaſion for the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who denounced open War againſt all manner of Effeminacy, to be called <hi>Men;</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were ſoft, and delicate in their way of Living, to be reproached with the Nick-name of <hi>Women.</hi> When <hi>Xerxes</hi> undertook to puniſh the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> for a
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:53648:646"/>Revolt they had made, and to ſecure himſelf againſt any danger that might come from that Quarter for the future: The Method he took, was to bring all the Exerciſe of Arms, and other laborious and fatiguing Practices into Diſuſe; and to let looſe all manner of Pleaſures and ſenſual Delights among them, with free Liberty for every Man to revel in theſe without Check or Controul.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> It baniſhes all the braveſt and moſt Heroick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from the Mind, where it hath taken poſſeſſion; for theſe are ſerious and ſevere, conſiderate and hardy, and cannot be endured by a Maſter of ſo contrary a Temper; nor indeed were it poſſible for them to live under ſo effeminate and diſſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ſo careleſs and unthinking a Government.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It quickly degenerates, and ſinks into its contrary Sentiment, which is Pain and Uneaſineſs, Diſlike and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe. As the Freſhes run apace to the Sea, and loſe the ſweetneſs of their native Rivers, in Tides of Salt Water. Thus the honey of Pleaſure in the Mouth, upbraids the Eater, and turns to the Gall of Pain upon the Stomach.<note n="*" place="bottom">In praecipiti eſt, ad dolorem vergit, in contrarium abit, niſi modum teneat: Extrema gaudli luctus occupat.</note> 
                              <hi>All exquiſite Pleaſure ſtands upon a tickliſh point, and all its generous Taſte is upon the turn; ſowrs, and changes, and is ſwallowed up in Pain; the very moment it riſes to exceſſive Joy, Grief dwells upon the confines, and one ſtep beyond its own bounds, brings you into this troubleſome Neighbours ground.</hi>

This is the Lure to draw us in, and when we are once in, we ſtick at nothing: This is the conveyer of ſecret Intelligences, the betrayer of Councils and Truſts, the contriver of Treaſons, and under-hand Deſigns againſt the Peace and Safety of Mankind. In ſhort, the love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ruins private Perſons by Prodigality and Injuſtice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours and ſtains whole Families by Debauchery, and ſhameleſs Lewdneſs: Propagates Diſeaſes, and entails Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary upon Children yet unborn; corrupts publick Juſtice; murder's Kings, overturns Governments, and ſcatters Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Miſery over the face of the whole Earth. Thus much may be moſt juſtly ſaid of Pleaſure in general, which being now ſufficiently enlarged upon, we will proceed to conſider the ſeveral kinds of it in particular.</p>

Gluttony and Drunkenneſs are groſs and paltry Vices; they
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:53648:647"/>diſcover themſelves, and ſufficiently publiſh their own Shame in the Countenances and Geſtures of the Perſons addicted to them. The beſt and leaſt forbidding whereof is a dozed, and heavy look; and indeed, the beſt Quality ſuch Men can have, is to be ſtupid and dull too. For certain it is, no Man yet, who is a ſlave to his Belly, was ever capable of doing any glorious or conſiderable Action. And, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we find them trifling and inſignificant Fellows, if not down right Beaſts and Sots. But Drunkenneſs eſpecially hath theſe curſed Effects, and puſhes Men upon the baſeſt, the moſt extravagant, and unaccountable actions in the World. Of which <hi>Alexander</hi> is a miſerable Inſtance, though otherwiſe a wonderful Prince; who in heat of Wine killed his old dear Friend <hi>Clytus,</hi> and when he came to be ſober; had like to have killed himſelf in Revenge. In ſhort, what can be ſaid bad enough of a Vice that robs the Mind of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the Body of Sence; makes grown People Children again, and Men of Wit mere Naturals, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling Fools?</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Sobriety therefore, which preſerves us from theſe nauſeous and deteſtable Excoſſes, deſerves our good Eſteem for its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects at leaſt. For although it be none of the moſt exalted Virtues, nor exceeding difficult to be maſtered, by Men of any tolerable Senſe, yet it leads the way to ſeveral other Virtues, and promotes many excellent Qualities. It chokes and crops our Vices in the very Bud, and intercepts the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, by which they ſhould ſubſiſt. It is the Mother of Health, and the beſt Phyſick for all manner of Diſeaſes; and the moſt probable inſurer of long Life. <hi>Socrates</hi> owed the vigorous and confirmed Health he enjoyed purely to Abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miouſneſs. <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> who was a Pattern of it to all Kings of after Ages, begot Children at Fourſcore and Six years Old, and won a Battel of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at Ninety Two. Whereas <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had naturally one of the beſt and ſtrongeſt Conſtitutions of any Man that ever lived, killed himſelf with Drinking in the very Flower of his Age. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons (as <hi>Atticus</hi> particularly) who have been given over by Phyſicians, of the Gout, and other Diſtempers, looked upon to be incurable, have been perfectly recovered by Abſtinence, and a ſparing regular Diet. And what can we deſire more for the Body, than a long, and a healthful Life? What can recommend any Virtue to Men fond of the World, if this will not? But then it is of equal advantage to the Soul too. For by this means our Heads are kept
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:53648:647"/>clear and unclouded, our Faculties awake and ſprightly, we are capable of thinking, and fit to be adviſed. All the very great Men in Story have been particularly eminent for their Sobriety; not only Philoſophers, and ſuch as made preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to a ſtrict and ſeverer Virtue, but all that have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and whoſe Names live upon Record, for any ſort of Greatneſs whatſoever. Such were <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Such was <hi>Epicurus</hi> too, who, though a profeſt admirer of Pleaſure, and run down as a Scandal to Philoſophy for eſpouſing it, was yet famous for theſe abſtemious Virtues, above any of his Accuſers. The <hi>Curij</hi> and <hi>Fabricij</hi> are more celebrated in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory for their frugality and ſimplicity of Diet, than for the greateſt and moſt glorious Conqueſts they ever won. And though the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> wanted neither Courage, nor Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, nor a Reputation equal to both, yet the Character they valued themſelves upon, and pretended moſt to, was that of ſtrict Diſcipline, Frugality and Sobriety.</p>

For how wretched is it, how ridiculous, to take Sanctuary here in our old Age, when we have made our ſelves living Hoſpitals, and are all over Aches and Pains? This is a folly, like that obſerved in the <hi>Athenians.;</hi> who are ſaid never to have asked a Peace, but in Mourning Weeds, for their Friends and Relations ſlain in Battel; when all their Men of Note were loſt, and they no longer in a condition to defend themſelves.

Now it is uſual with all Inventions to increaſe and multiply; every day refines and improves them ſtill more, till at laſt there is no end of their Variety. Multiplicity is the certain Character of Art, as Simplicity is of Nature. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence then of Apparel being Artificial, is that it runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inſinite Fantaſtical forms, and differs in proportion to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Fanſies and Humours. Accordingly we find, that the greater part of Tradeſmen and Handicrafts Men deal in ſuch Commodities and Manufactures as are converted to the defence and ornament of the Body. But it were well if this only were regarded; for from hence they are come to ſuch Extravagancies and Abuſes, that our Garments are no longer a covering to our Defects, and a ſupply to our Neceſſities, but a neſt of Vanity and Vice<note n="*" place="bottom">Nîdus Luxuriae.</note> Theſe are the great occaſion of Quarrels and Diſputes; for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of property ſeems to have begun in this point: When things were moſt in common, every Man had a peculiar ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Cloths he wore, which is intimated by the <hi>French</hi> Language in particular, expreſſing all manner of Rapine, by <hi>Stripping, Dérober;</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word <hi>Robbing,</hi> is very probably an Alluſion to the ſame thing.</p>

How wretched a thing is it to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Care and Coſt laid out upon Luxury and Shew, and the general neglect of thoſe ſhining Habits of the Mind; that Virtue, that Bravery which ſhould enable us to make a beautiful Appearance, and ſet us off in real and ſolid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellences?

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> COntinency is a Virtuo of very difficult Practice, and requires an exceeding ſtrong and vigilant guard over our ſelves: For all our perfections of this kind are ſo many violences upon nature and inclination, which are not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſe to be withſtood without much Toil and Painfulneſs, and very obſtinate Reſolutions, but in this before us eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:53648:649"/>becauſe here the propenſions to Vice ſeem to be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the Sollicitations to it more frequent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than in any other inſtance whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But ſtill the greater the difficulty of this Conqueſt is, the greater is its Commendation, and the more juſt and glorious its Triumph. And very neceſſary it is, that every Man ſhould rally his Forces and engage manfully in this War with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Continency is allowed no poſitive Virtue, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports no more than a Man's governing and reſtraining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far as not to act contrary to his Duty. It produces no fruit, but conſiſts in privation and a forbearing to act; and therefore Virginity muſt always imply Barrenneſs. This is the caſe of Continency conſidered abſtractedly and in its own nature, which at this rate is of no higher a Claſs in the ſcale of Virtues than the abſtaining from Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, or any other ſort of Vicious Exceſs. But if we conſider it in a Chriſtian and more exalted Senſe, then it imports a great deal more: for thus there are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Qualifications which make it a very noble Virtue; the one is a ſettled purpoſe to continue in it pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed, with a Chaſt Mind and mortified Affections, no leſs than a Body holy and undefiled: The other, that this be done for Religious and Excellent ends, to gain greater advantages of becoming Singular, and exemplary in Piety and all manner of goodneſs. For (as St. <hi>Auguſt in</hi> ſays,) <hi>It is not the Single State that we commend in Virgins, but their Abandoning the World, and Conſecrating their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies entirely to God:</hi> Witneſs the Veſtals of Old, and the Five Fooliſh Virgins in the Parable, whoſe Celibacy ſtood them in no ſtead at all. And here I obſerve by the way, how Abſurd a Vanity and Popular an Errour that is, which in common ſpeech calls the Ladies who have no blemiſh upon their Reputation, and who either are Chaſt in the Single Life or Faithful in the Married one; Women of great Virtues and great Honour. Honour! For what? Is Honour ſunk ſo low, that the meer not doing evil and not violating one's Duty in the moſt Scandalous inſtance muſt pretend to that name? Why do we not by the ſame Reaſon ſtyle thoſe Men of Honour who are under the ſame Circumſtances? Nay, there would indeed be more Reaſon for this than the other, becauſe the manner of the World puts more Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of offending in theſe reſpects, and expoſes Men to ſtronger Temptations, than Women are liable to. But in truth, Honour is ſo far from being a Recompence due to
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:53648:649"/>the abſtaining from evil, that it is not every ſort of good, which when punctually performed can lay claim to it; but (as was ſaid before) thoſe kinds and degrees of good only which bring advantage to the World, and which, beſides their being beneficial, have coſt great toil and trouble, and been atchieved with conſiderable difficulty and danger.</p>
                           <p>But beſides; how few of theſe Continent perſons arrive even at a common and very practicable Virtue? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them do we find ſcandalouſly tainted with other Vices, and making up for this ſelf-denial by indulgences to ſome more darling Humour or Paſſion? Particularly, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding few are there who eſcape the Temptations to Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Preſumption, and Spiritual Pride, and while they take marvellous Content in their own perfections are very liberal in their Cenſures and Condemnations of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Does not experience frequently convince us, how very dear ſome Husbands pay for the Fidelity of their Wives; who while they diſpoſſeſs the Devil in one part of their Souls and preſerve their Honour entire, do yet erect a Throne for him, and let him reign Triumphant in another? If then this Virtue beget inſolence and Malice, Cenſoriouſneſs and Imperious Pride, it is like to turn at laſt but to very poor account. And thus clogged will very ill deſerve the name of Virtue, whatever it might be allowed otherwiſe: Not that I am over ſcrupulous, or would ſtand with the Sex for a Complement; and therefore, provided the flattering them with this title of Honour, will contribute any thing to the making them more tender of it, and encourage the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Decency becoming their Sex and Condition, I ſhall be content to promote the diſcharge of their Duty at any rate, though it be by ſtraining a point to gratifie an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vanity. But to return; It is likewiſe obſervable, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency when ſimply and ſtrictly conſidered, like other faults which are what we call Corporeal, and tending to gratifie the Carnal inclinations of Humane nature, hath no mighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in its own ſingle ſelf; (it being only an exceſs of what is natural and not contrary to Humane nature,) but then there is a train of vices ſo black and hideous attending it, and ſome or more of them ſo inſeparable from it, that the danger of being entangled in thoſe ſnares is infinite, and the conſequence very fatal: For this is one of thoſe ſins that never go alone, but is accompanied with other Devils more and more wicked than it ſelf; tainted with baſe and villainous circumſtances of perſons and places, and times
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:53648:650"/>prohibited and unpardonable; Intrigues carried on, and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfactions contrived by the wickedeſt methods; Lyes and Tricks, and all manner of Deceit; Subornation and Forſwearing, and Treachery; to all which we may add that which is by no means inconſiderable; the loſs of Time, the diſtraction of Thought, the interruption of Buſineſs, and other unbecoming Follies, which draw very great and juſt Scandals, and inſupportable miſchiefs after them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now becauſe this Vice hath every Quality that can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Enemy formidable, ſince it is both violent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and attacks us at once with open force and ſecret ſtratagems, our Care muſt likewiſe be double; Firſt to arm and prepare our ſelves for the Combat, and then to watch diligently the approaches, obſerve its Feints, and be well aware of thoſe baits and wheedling Inſinuations which are laid on purpoſe to decoy us into Ambuſhments and Ruine: And the more theſe inclinations ſooth and cajole us, the more ſuſpicious we muſt be, and turn the deaf Ear to their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering importunities. Among other Conſiderations therefore fit to be oppoſed to ſuch Temptations, theſe that follow may not be improper to reflect upon: That another perſon's Beauty is nothing at all to us, what we can never call or make our own; That it is no certain happineſs even to them who have it, but turns as often to their prejudice, and is at leaſt equally diſpoſed to do ſo as to their Advantage: That in ſhort, it is a flower always withering and in decay; a very ſmall and fanciful thing, little elſe but the outward skin, nay leſs than that, the Colour and Complection of it only; And therefore, if in this we would admire the delicacy and skill of nature let us prize it here, as we are wont to do thoſe much more aſtoniſhing Beauties of the Sun and Moon, for their Excellencies and the good influences they ſhed. When we enjoy this Beauty, and have made it our own property by fair and honeſt means, let us even then remember that this is a very low and mean ſatisfaction, ſo far from being peculiar to the dignity of Humane nature, that Brutes all partake and are moſt of them ſuppoſed to exceed us in it; That the immoderate uſe of Pleaſure waſtes the Body, ſoftens and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminates the Soul, enfeebles and darkens the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That a world of people have fallen miſerable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their inordinate Luſts, ſome in the loſs of their Lives, others of their Fortunes, and others of their Senſes, but the Reputations murdered by it are innumerable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider again, that there is more honour, nay, I will add more
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:53648:650"/>pleaſure too, in vanquiſhing theſe deſires than in complying with them. And all the tranſports of fruition are flat and dull, nauſeous and inſipid, in compariſon of thoſe raviſhing ſatisfactions which overflow in our Souls, when we have gained a virtuous and noble Conqueſt over our ſelves. And this is the general Senſe of Sober Mankind; for there is no one Action in the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> in which their Hiſtorians ſo juſtly glory, as that of the treatment they gave to their beautiful Captives, and the tenderneſs for their Honour, which the Fortune of War was generally thought a privilege to violate. This Continency and Conqueſt of themſelves is more highly commended than all their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and hath more engaging Charms than the faireſt of their Priſoners could ever boaſt of. Theſe I ſay, are Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pertinent and proper enough, but it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould have a conſtant efficacy: For this Vice abounds with Sophiſtry and cunning, and as it will not be reaſoned with ſometimes, ſo at other times it will not be ſafe to go about it; And therefore in caſes of violent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, the beſt courſe will be to betake our ſelves to our heels and get looſe from the Temptation. And it is very obſervable, that the Holy Ghoſt which bids us in all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes <hi>Reſiſt the Devil,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">

Buſineſs, Recreation, Company, any thing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this ſtream of our Thoughts and Affections into another Channel: There can be no difficulty in the Choice; for in ſuch caſes the worſt Company a Man can poſſibly be in is to have none but his own.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now we are to obſerve, that both the Virtue of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and its contrary Vice is of ſeveral kinds and different degrees: The chief and that which I ſhall ſpeak to at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is the Conjugal ſort, that mutual and inviolable Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between Man and Wife, which, as it was the firſt and higheſt Obligation, ſo is it the moſt ſacred, the moſt important, and that which both Publick Society and Private Perſons are deeply and inevitably intereſted in: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ought to be held in the moſt Profound Veneration and Eſteem; and not ſuffered to become the Jeſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſcorn of profligate Lewdneſs; the Diverſion of a
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:53648:651"/>Theatre; or the boaſted Triumph of a Man of the Town. The Parties concerned in theſe holy Engagements muſt have no Affections, nor cheriſh any deſires beyond the Chaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of each other; but utterly Abandon the very wiſhes of ſtollen and unlawful delights, and be content <hi>to Drink the Waters of their own Ciſtern;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prov. 5.15.</note> and <hi>the running Waters of their own Well;</hi> that is, pure and innocent, unpolluted and untroubled delights of a faithful and lawful Marriage; as the Wiſe Man expreſſes it, according to the uſual ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and extraordinary decency of the Scripture Stile. They that allow themſelves in other liberties, fall into the blackeſt and moſt complicated guilt imaginable; they violate and Sin againſt their own Bodies, by making them Veſſels and Inſtruments of Uncleanneſs and Diſhonour; they tranſgreſs againſt all manner of Laws which any Man can be bound by. The Laws of Revealed Religion which forbid us to proſtitute our ſelves to ſilthineſs and ſhame, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſtricteſt purity of Converſation; the Law of Nature, which forbids the invading another Man's proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the tenderer the right is to him, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable is the injuſtice; the Law of Reaſon and Equity, which enjoyns fidelity and ſtedfaſtneſs to promiſes and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contracts; the Laws of the Land, which have Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Marriages as the only conveyance of Right, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Title and Propriety in ſuch caſes; the undoubted Rights of Families, by grafting in a foreign growth upon the natural Stock, injuring the other Children, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the fruit of a Man's Induſtry, his Acquiſition or his Inheritance, to Strangers and Interlopers; the Laws of Juſtice and Charity, by ſtarting difficulties and Diſputes among Friends and Relations; alienating the Affections of Parents from their Children, and diſſolving in great meaſure the Duty of Children to their Parents, when there are theſe Jealouſies among them; and leaving a laſting and indelible ſtain upon the Unfortunate (though innocent) Poſterity of ſo ſuſpected a Race.</p>
                           <p>As to the other parts of this Vice I add only in one word; that though Adultery be the higheſt, yet it is not the only Violation of it; Men would therefore do well to ſee how many Aggravations of this kind juſt now mentioned concur in any of thoſe allowances they make to themſelves; to lay aſide the byaſs of their preſent Paſſion, and even in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſimple Fornication, ask their own Conſciences how they ſhould like to have the honour of a Siſter or a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:53648:651"/>ſo injured by another perſon; and if they think but ſcurvily of ſuch a blemiſh in a near Relation, this at leaſt makes the gratification an offence againſt Reaſon and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and natural Juſtice; nor is it in ſuch circumſtances for a Man to alledge that the partner of the crime is no other Man's, it is enough to Condemn him that She is not his own.</p>

                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THat this is a Deſire which ſtands in great need of being tempered and reſtrained, no Man can ſuffer himſelf to doubt who at all conſiders the inordinacy of the Affection, the injurious courſes it puſhes the Patient upon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſchief it does to ſociety, when the Reins are let looſe and we give it its head. But though the free Range of this Affection be ſo pernicious, yet we ought to take notice, that (according to what hath been formerly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſame occaſion) all Ambition, all thirſt either of Honour or of Reputation is not to be condemned without any diſtinction, but that as it may be ordered and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there is a great deal of good as well as hurt in the thing. For thus much may undoubtedly be alledged in its behalf, that it is of very great advantage to the State; ſince as the World now goes, the generous and publick ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Actions are moſt of them owing to it. This puſhes Men on to hazardous Attempts, and thus we find it hath ever done; for, even among the Ancients, it is not to be ſuppoſed that all their ſo much celebrated Heroes were acted by a truly Philoſophical Spirit. There were indeed your <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> your <hi>Cato's</hi> and <hi>Scipio's,</hi> who ſeem to have been Charmed by the bright Ideas of Virtue, without any the leaſt mixture of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and mercenary Conſiderations; but then there were a great many more who were manifeſtly moved by other Springs, ſuch as <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who courted Fame, and were led on by the proſpect of Greatneſs and Renown. And, though it be very true, that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Exploits of ſuch Perſons when nicely examined, and
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:53648:652"/>conſidered with regard to their proper Motives and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples their Authors went upon, be not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the product of Virtue but of Ambition only; yet ſtill they muſt be acknowledged of general uſe and benefit, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them to the publick in all reſpects the very ſame, as if the inducements had been the moſt refined and perfect that Humane nature is in any Caſe capable of. Now beſides the force of this Conſideration to commend it, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have allowed it to be excuſable at leaſt upon two occaſions; the one is, when the Actions it excites Men to are profitable and good, but not in a degree of perfection eminent enough to pretend to the title of Virtuous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lie in common to all Mankind, and the good or ill diſpoſitions of our minds incapacitate, no perſon from excelling in them. Of this kind particularly are Arts and Sciences, Humane Inventions, Military Courage, and all manner of Induſtry in general: The other is, when we find it neceſſary to preſerve the favour and good Opinion of ſome perſon upon whom our intereſt depends; for though it be a ſtanding rule in Philoſophy, never to make the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others the meaſure of our Behaviour, yet there is this reſerve, and allowed Exception, that we may govern our ſelves upon ſuch principles, to avoid the inconveniences which either the want or Contempt of other Men's approbation may happen to involve us in.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But indeed for a Man to practice Virtue merely upon this account, and aim at Honour and Reputation as if this were the proper wages and recompence of doing well, is not only a very vain and erroneous, but a moſt dangerous and deſtructive principle. This were a horrible diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed, that Virtue ſhould be rendered ſo precarious as to derive all its value from hence, and to engage our Affections upon no better Conſiderations than what are drawn from the judgment of the World: Every body muſt needs diſcern the courſeneſs of this Alloy, and that ſuch payment ought not to paſs upon us. Virtue certainly is not yet ſo debaſed as to go a begging, and deſiring teſtimonials for a ſubſiſtance. This reward is much below her ſeeking; and therefore we ſhould ſo fix our minds with true and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ideas of her, and ſettle our affections ſo firmly upon the thing it ſelf, that this accidental luſtre of the honours attending her may not dazle the Eyes of Reaſon, but leave us ſtill the Diſcretion, to make a difference between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving theſe as acknowledgments due for our good Actions,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:53648:652"/>and propounding them to our minds, as the end and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Reward of them: So ſhall we be eſtabliſhed upon a true bottom, and proceed upon reſolutions ſincere and immovable, ſuch as will ſtand like ſo many Barriers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Soul, and guard it againſt the vain aſſaults of vanity and Ambition, and every mean and ſelfiſh induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A Man ſhould be thoroughly perſwaded of the ſufficiency and ſelf-ſatisfaction of Virtue, that it asks no Nobler a Theatre to repreſent its excellency in than one's own Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; this is ſpectator and audience enough, and if this applaud the Action the matter is not great who diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it. The higher the Sun is above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the leſs ſhadow it caſts; and the more Sublime any Man's Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is, the leſs affectation of Honour and Fame it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with. Nor is the ſimilitude improper, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of the thing: For Glory is in earneſt a very ſhadow, it follows thoſe that flie from it, and runs away from thoſe that purſue it. We ſhould always remember who ſent us hither and what we are doing. That Life is a Play where the parts are infinitely various, but no Man chooſes what he will act; he acquits himſelf well who ſtudies the humour of the part aſſigned him, and performs it agreeably to its Character, or (as <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſays upon another occaſion,) that we live in this World, as People ſit at an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where every well mannered Man will be content to feed upon that Diſh which the Maſter of the Feaſt helps him to, without reaching over the Table, and ſcrambling and ſnatching from other People's Plates. If then a Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſome Office of Honour and Truſt be offered to us, if we are capable of diſcharging it, let us accept it gladly, but modeſtly too; and let us do the duty of it faithfully and ſincerely; aſſuring our ſelves, that God hath ſet us our Poſt; and that by committing to us a publick Truſt, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects we ſhould ſtand Centry, and be continually upon the Guard; that by our vigilant care thoſe who are committed to our charge may ſleep ſecurely. And for all this Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attendance, let us propoſe no other Recompence or Commendation, than that only of our own Conſciences; and the ſweet ſatisfactions of doing what becomes us; or if others do, (as without queſtion, they will) ſee and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Good works; let us deſire, that the Teſtimony of our having done well, may be graven in the Hearts of our Countrey, rather than publiſhed by Statues, and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:53648:653"/>Frontiſpieces, and long flattering Inſcriptions. In a word, let this be a Principle with us; that the Fruit of noble, generous Actions cannot poſſibly be loſt; that the glory of having done them is an ample Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And that, when Virtue deſcends to go out of her ſelf, and look abroad for a Reward, ſhe undervalues her own worth, and muſt take up with things beneath her. To deſpiſe Greatneſs, and expoſe the vanity of ſetting our Hearts upon it, is no ſuch mighty matter. He that loves himſelf, and can make any tolerable Judgment of Happineſs, will be content with a moderate and eaſie For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; the Stations that are at the top of Mankind, as they excell in Dignity, ſo they exceed in Harms, and Difficulty, and Trouble; and thoſe that are at the very bottom, tormented with Poverty, and anxious uncertainties of Subſiſtence, are equally to be declined. Here is too much Buſineſs, or too much Suffering, for any Man of ſound Wiſdom to wiſh, none but ſickly Palates will be fond of either. <hi>Otanes,</hi> one of the ſeven, who had a joynt Right to the Principality of <hi>Perſia,</hi> quitted his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the reſt of the Competitors, provided that he and all his Family might live quietly under that Government, and be free from all Subjection, except ſuch as the old ſtanding Laws obliged them to. This was truly great, neither to affect to command, nor bear to be commanded; and other inſtances of contemning Honour and Greatneſs, we have ſeveral in Story; for even <hi>Diocleſian</hi> diveſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Empire, and <hi>Celeſtine</hi> quitted the Papacy; ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle have the Charms of Sovereignty it ſelf been ſound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tryal, and ſo far from impracticable is the utmoſt pitch of the Virtue oppoſite to Ambition.</p>

                              </note> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly illuſtrated at large, all that lies upon me to do more at preſent, is only to lay down ſome ſhort and plain Directions, for our Conduct and good management of ſo very important a Member.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let our Diſcourſe then be ſober and ſparing, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how and when to be ſilent is a mighty advantage, and contributes exceedingly to our knowing how to ſpeak; for he that is unskilfull in one of theſe Points, can never be expert in the other. To talk much and to talk well are Qualities that ſeldom or never go together; and therefore one of the Philoſophers made it his Obſervation, that the moſt accompliſhed Men, are generally they that ſay leaſt. Thoſe that abound in words, are commonly barren both in good Senſe, and good Actions; like Trees, which when they ſhoot in great quantities of Leaves, bear little Fruit; or lean Corn that runs all into Straw. The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> (of whom we have made ſo frequent mention, for their noble improvements in Virtue and Valour,) were no leſs memorable for Silence, and made this one part of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Profeſſion, to Educate their Youth in a modeſt and reſerved way of Converſation. So juſtly, ſo generally is this ſort of Reſtraint approved and commended; ſo neceſſary, ſo prudent, that Prayer of the Pſalmiſt, that God would enable him by his Grace, to <hi>ſet a Watch before his mouth, and keep the door of his lips.</hi> An Emblem of this we have in the Moſaical Inſtitution; where, among many Typical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of Moral Duties this ſeems to be one; That every Veſſel was unclean, which had not a Cover faſtened to it:
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:53648:654"/>And the wiſeſt Author that ever wrote, hath left us this Mark to diſtinguiſh Men by, <hi>The Heart of Fools is in their mouth, but the Tongue of the Wiſe is in their Heart.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A ſecond Qualification abſolutely neceſſary upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is Truth; without this the end of Speech is utterly perverted and loſt. For Speech was principally deſigned to be aſſiſting to Truth, in bringing others to the knowledge of it, by repreſenting every thing in its native and proper Colours; and diſcovering the myſteries of Errour and Deceit; that being thus detected, they may no longer have it in their power to miſ-lead our Judgments. For what indeed is Speech, but a Key to our Thoughts? An inſtrument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating what we feel, and ſee, and deſire, and ſo of transfuſing our whole Hearts into the boſoms of them with whom we converſe? Now this makes it obvious to every conſidering Man; that Fidelity and exact Truth ought to be an inſeparable attendant upon every Word we utter; for there is no other method of conveying our Intelligence; no other Glaſs in which we can ſee one another's Souls; and therefore it is as much as all the benefits of Converſation, and Commerce, and this noble Prerogative of Mankind is worth, to take care, that the Mirrour caſt no falſe Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He that falſifies in his Diſcourſe, ought to be treated as a common Enemy; deteſted as a Traytor to publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; For if when once this Footing fails us, we have no freſh ground to ſtand upon, all Faith and Security is given up, and we know not where to have Men, nor what to make of them. How vile the Sin of Lying is, hath been declared before.<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>10.</hi>
                              </note> They who practice it out of deſign, are of all wretches the moſt profligate and deſpicable; and they who do it in Raillery, ſhould conſider how inſolent a thing it is to banter and abuſe the Credulity of Mankind; and that Truth and mutual Faith are things much too ſerious and too weighty to be made a Diverſion, and ſacrificed to the itch of an unmannerly Jeſt.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Thirdly, Our Expreſſions ſhould be Natural and Modeſt and Chaſt; provoking no bluſhes, offenſive to none, even the moſt nice and purged Ears; our Diſcourſe free from Vehemence and Contention; for in ſuch caſes Men ſeem to be more concerned for themſelves than for the Truth; and to ſpeak, not ſo much the reaſon of the thing, as their own Paſſions. Speech was deſigned for a mutual Comfort and Improvement; to inform and mend Men's Minds, not to corrupt and ſeduce them, And therefore, as Artifice and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:53648:654"/>is nauſeous, ſo Indecency and Lewdneſs, and every thing that tends to Obſcenity or Licentiouſneſs, is wicked and abominable.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fourthly, Our Diſcourſe ſhould be ſerious and ſignificant, profitable and advantageous; not trifling, and impertinent and vain. The little Tattle of the Town, what is done at the Court, or the Park, or the Play-Houſe; how People were dreſſed, and how they behaved themſelves; repeating idle Verſes, ſcraps of Plays, and little fooliſh Jeſts, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling frivolous Stories; though they make up ſo very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a part of modiſh Converſation, are yet, (to ſpeak freely,) ſigns of a great poverty of Thought, and have more of the Buffoon, than of the Man in them. He that provides no better Entertainment for his Company, than all this amounts to, is at a very low Ebb; and ſhews, that he hath ſpent a great deal of time to very ſmall purpoſe. How very little hath a Man to do, that employs himſelf at this rate: And what precious account does all that leiſure turn to, which hath been laid out upon qualifying himſelf for ſo noble and accompliſht a way of Diſcourſe? Under this head of Trifling and Impertinence, I think we may very well reckon that Folly of entertaining Company with long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of our Selves, and our own Affairs; what Feats we have done, or what Calamities we have ſuffered; for of what conſequence ſoever theſe things may be to us, they are of none at all to the Perſons we tell them to; except it be to give them a taſte of our Folly, and from a diſlike of our Converſation, to avoid the ſame abſurdity in their own. We fancy, becauſe theſe Accidents are pleaſing to us, that they are ſo to them; but alas! the difference of Perſons ſhould be conſidered; for to render the Story agreeable to tell, there needs no other Recommendation, than that our ſelves are at the bottom of it; but then the very ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon renders it as nauſeous to the Hearer, not only becauſe he finds no Concern of his own there, but from that natural Averſion and Diſdain we bear to Men, who are always big and full of themſelves, and have the vanity to ſuppoſe, that whatever relates to them is worthy to be the Concern of all they converſe with.</p>
                           <p>But eſpecially, we ſhould be careful not to tranſgreſs this Rule of profiting others, by running into the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of Injurious or Offenſive Language; For Speech is in the very original intention of it, an Inſtrument, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, a Reconciler, and Uniter of Mankind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:53648:655"/>to apply it to any purpoſes contrary to theſe, is to abuſe, and pervert the nature and deſign of it. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration was never more neceſſary than now; and, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the modern way of Converſation, would ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, how vainly thoſe Perſons pretend to Wit, and Senſe, and Honour, whoſe whole Diſcourſe conſiſts of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Detraction, Mockery or Reproach, ſacrificing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the abſent to an ill-natured Jeſt; or expoſing and ridiculing their Defects, by Mimickry, and Buffoonery; all which are infinitely unbecoming the Character ſuch Men aſpire after, and a Diverſion too baſe and barbarous for any Wiſe or Good Man to allow himſelf in.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Our Diſcourſe ſhould be Eaſie and Pleaſant, Courteous and Entertaining; not Rough and Harſh, Difficult and Troubleſome. For this reaſon it will require ſome prudence in the Choice, or the declining of our Subject. We ſhould contrive, as much as poſſibly we can, to ſtart nothing but what will keep our Company in good humour; never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in Controverſies, where any that are preſent ſhall find themſelves concerned; for this either diſobliges, if they think fit to let the Argument fall; or elſe it draws them into Diſputes, and occaſions Warmth, and Uneaſineſs; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Coldneſs, and angry Reſentments afterwards. But, though there ſhould be no perſonal Intereſt in the caſe, yet nothing of Controverſie in general ſhould be induſtriouſly begun; for common Diſcourſe is not the proper ſeaſon for that. If the Queſtion be Subſtantial and of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the reſpect of a private Conference is due to it; but if it be ſome nice and ſubtle point, it is not worth ſo much as our common Talk. Such Queſtions have been aptly enough compared to Crabfiſh, of which ſome are all Shell, and when we have taken great pains to open, and prepare them for our Palates, nine parts of ten muſt be thrown away, and a very poor pittance remains fit for Eating. Their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and abſtruſe Speculations raiſe a Noiſe and a Duſt, but when we examine what account they turn to, little comes of them, but Heat, and Calmour, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Our Expreſſions ſhould be ſtrong and clear, our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſinewy and full; not looſe, and flat, and languiſhing; and therefore we ſhould obſerve and avoid the formality of Pedants, the ſtiff-ſet way of Pleaders, and the impertinent Affectation of the Ladies.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> This particular ſort of Temperance extends likewiſe to one very neceſſary Virtue, which I think may not unfitly be called the Continence of the Tongue: That I mean, of keeping Secrets; which, though already ſpoken to in the Chapter concerning Fidelity,<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>8.</hi>
                              </note> I thought not improper to make another mention of here. And the rather, becauſe I take Secrets here in a more large and comprehenſive Senſe; ſo that the Virtue at preſent preſcribed, does not only oblige us not to diſcloſe thoſe things, which were committed to our Truſt, under the Seal of Secreſie; but alſo to ſuppreſs, whatever in Prudence and our own Diſcretion, appears unfit to be divulged. All that is dangerous, or of ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; all that can any way reflect upon our own, or be injurious to another's Reputation. In a word, ſo ſtrict a Guard, ſo ſteady a Conduct in all our Converſation, that our Tongue may not out-run our Judgment; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our own Conſciences, or thoſe we keep Company with, upon the ſevereſt and moſt impartial Recollection, have cauſe to accuſe us, of ſaying any thing which was not fit to be ſaid. This is of greater Importance, and needs to be more diligently attended to, than People ſeem generally well aware of; and yet it is no more, than every Man's own Reflections upon the indecent Gayeties, and unthinking Freedoms, in Converſation, and the many ill Effects and hard Cenſures theſe produce, may ſoon convince him of: And ſatisfie him, not only of the Beauty and Comelineſs, but of the ſafety and great advantage there is, in a modeſt and cautious reſerve. While the word is kept in, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely our own; but if it once break looſe from us, it can never be retrieved; we have loſt all our Property and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and muſt ſtand to the courteſie of the World; who will make what uſe they pleaſe of it, and very ſeldom are juſt or good-natured enough, to make the right uſe, or to underſtand it as innocently as we intended it.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Now as the advantage of Speech in general is an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence peculiar to Mankind, and ſets us above Brutes; ſo Eloquence exalts thoſe that are Maſters and Profeſſors of it, above the rate of common Men. For this is the Art, or Science of ſpeaking, a more accurate and exquiſite way of Communicating our Thoughts; of enforcing and adorning Reaſon: This is the Rudder of the Soul that ſteers and turns Men, and ſets us at the Helm of our Audience, to carry them whither we pleaſe: It falls in with the Heart, and ſecretly moves our Paſſions, like the Chords in Muſick,
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:53648:656"/>which, in a skilful Compoſition, conſpire together to make a more perfect, and delightful Harmony.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> By Eloquence I mean, all that is neceſſary to make an accompliſhed Orator. For this does conſiſt, not only in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, and purity of Expreſſion, the Elegance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Words, the happy Choice and regular Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the fulneſs and roundneſs of the Period, and the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſweet and muſical Cadence; but it muſt alſo be aſſiſted and ſtrengthned by other Ornaments and Graces, and Motions of the Perſon himſelf: Every Word ſhould be inſpired with Life and Vigour; firſt, by a clear and ſweet Voice, a proper and diſtinct Pronunciation, riſing and falling, gently and eaſily, as is beſt accommodated to the matter and deſign: Then by a grave and unaffected Action, where the Countenance, the Hands, the whole Body, the every part and geſture ſpeak as well as the Mouth, all follow them ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul, and give a lively Image of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within. For the Orator is the Repreſentative of his Audience, and muſt firſt of all in his own Perſon put on the ſeveral Paſſions, which he labours to infuſe into others.

                           <p>It is in ſuch caſes with the Standers by, as it was with <hi>Braſidas</hi> and his Enemy, who drew the Dart out of his own Wound, with which he ſtabbed him to the Heart. Thus Paſſion is firſt conceived and formed in our own Mind, then born and brought into the World by appoſite Expreſſion, and afterwards, by a ſubtle and quick Contagion, conveyed into others, and begets its likeneſs there. By this ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection it ſufficiently appears, that Men of ſoft and gentle Tempers, are not cut out for Orators. Their Spirits are too ſedate and ſluggiſh to communicate any powerful Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They want the Force, and Fire, the Sprightlineſs and Activity, that is neceſſary to animate what they ſay. And when ſuch Perſons would diſplay the moſt maſterly
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:53648:656"/>beauties of Eloquence, they languiſh and faulter by the way, and drop ſhort of the Mark. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> reproached <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> who accuſed <hi>Gallus</hi> with a ſneaking Voice and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Action, by telling him, that his Coldneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency betrayed the falſeneſs of his Charge. But when a Man hath all that Vigour and Ornament touched upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his Words will be as ſtrong and compulſive as the Commands of a Tyrant, with all the Pomp and Terrour of his Guards about him. They will commit an irreſiſtible Violence upon the Soul; not only perſwade and draw, but drag his Auditory whether they will or no, lead them in Triumph, and eſtabliſh to themſelves an Abſolute and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Dominion over the Minds of Men.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> It may perhaps be objected in prejudice of Eloquence, that all this Skill is needleſs; ſince Truth alone is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powerful and perſwaſive, and ſtands in need of no ſtudied and artificial Practices, to vindicate, or to recommend it. And indeed, were the Minds of Men free, and pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepoſſeſt with Paſſion, or Intereſt, or any other prejudicate Opinion, the Objection muſt be allowed to have a great deal of weight in it. But we are to conſider and deal with Men, according to the ſtate we find them in; a ſtate of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Prejudice, in which Art, or Nature, Miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or ill Habits have bribed and byaſſed their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and made them draw the wrong way, and bent them violently againſt the Truth. And thus they come to require a ſort of Treatment, very different from that, which is moſt agreeable to their original Conſtitution. As therefore we are forced, firſt of all to ſoften and open the pores of the Steel by Fire, that it may afterwards receive that Liquor which tempers it, and grow harder in the Water: ſo the warmths of Eloquence are neceſſary to put the Spirits in motion, and by rendring the Minds of Men more ſupple and pliable, to give them a ſtronger and more laſting tincture of Truth. This is the true and proper deſign of Eloquence; and the end it ſhould conſtantly aim at, is, to fortifie and protect Virtue againſt Vice, Truth againſt Falſhood, and Innocence againſt Calumny and falſe Accuſation. The Orator (ſays <hi>Theophraſtus</hi>) is the true Phyſician of Souls, and his buſineſs muſt be to Cure the Venomous Bitings of Serpents, by the Charms of his Muſick; that is, The poyſonous Slanders, and falſe Inſinuations of wicked Men, by the harmony of Reaſon, ſet out to the beſt advantage. But ſince there is no poſſibility of cutting off ill Men from the uſe of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:53648:657"/>too, ſince they will be ſure to ſeize and uſurp the Weapon, for the more effectual Execution of their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Deſigns; we are the more concerned not to go into the Field Naked, but to beat them at their own Weapon, and with equal Induſtry and Skill to Counter-work them; that ſo Virtue and Truth may not be circumvented, or tamely loſt, for want of proper Preparations to defend it. Several indeed have abuſed their attainments of this kind to very villainous purpoſes, and made Eloquence the inſtrument of Ruin and Oppreſſion to private Perſons, and whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Men. This is a melancholy Truth; too manifeſt to be denied. But then the Conſequence of grancing it muſt be, not to deſpiſe or ſet aſide the thing, upon the account of any ill Effects, that have followed upon the miſemployment of it. No, This is a Misfortune common to every thing, that is uſeful and excellent; for none of theſe are ſo neceſſarily confined to Goodneſs, but that they are capable of being perverted to very great Evil. Nature hath provided them with an Aptitude and Efficacy; but it will depend upon the Diſpoſition of the Perſon that manages thoſe Powers, what ſort of Effects thoſe natural Abilities ſhall be applied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to. For even that Reaſon and Underſtanding, which is the peculiar Prerogative of Humane Nature, and ſets us above Brutes, is moſt miſerably abuſed; turned againſt God and our ſelves, and made the occaſion of our more inexcuſable Ruin; but this is only an accidental Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, far from the natural tendency of ſo noble a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. And he, who would argue from hence that Mankind had better want theſe Faculties, may juſtly ſeem to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into Brute, and to be forſaken of all that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which he ſo wildly and ſo raſhly condemns.</p>
